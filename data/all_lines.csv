Episode,Character,Line
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, [voice-over] Space. It seems to go on and on forever. But then you get to the end and the gorilla starts throwing barrels at you.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, And that's how you play the game!
Space Pilot 3000,Boy," You stink, loser!"
Space Pilot 3000,Panucci," Hey, Fry. Pizza goin' out! C'mon!!"
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," Michelle, baby! Where you going?"
Space Pilot 3000,Michelle," It's not working out, Fry. [Next to her is a guy with his arm around her. The cab pulls away.] [shouting; from cab] I put your stuff out on the sidewalk!"
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," I hate my life, I hate my life, I hate my life."
Space Pilot 3000,Bike Thief, Happy new year!
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for, uh ... [He reads the delivery note.] ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud! I always thought at this point in my life I'd be the one making the crank calls! [He sits down on the chair, puts his feet on the desk and opens a can of beer.] Here's to another lousy millennium."
Space Pilot 3000,Crowd, [chanting] Ten!
Space Pilot 3000,Crowd, [chanting] Neuf!
Space Pilot 3000,Crowd, [chanting] Otto!
Space Pilot 3000,Crowd, [chanting] Saba!
Space Pilot 3000,Crowd, [chanting] Eksi!
Space Pilot 3000,Crowd, [chanting] Wu!
Space Pilot 3000,Crowd, [chanting] Char!
Space Pilot 3000,Crowd, [chanting] Thathu!
Space Pilot 3000,Crowd, [chanting] Nee!
Space Pilot 3000,Crowd, [chanting] One!
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, What the--?
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," My God! It's the future. My parents, my co-workers, my girlfriend; I'll never see any of them again. Yahoo!"
Space Pilot 3000,Terry, [melodramatically] Welcome to the world of tomorrow!
Space Pilot 3000,Lou, Why do you always have to say it that way?
Space Pilot 3000,Terry," Haven't you ever heard of a little thing called showmanship? [He turns to Fry.] [dramatically] Come, your destiny awaits!"
Space Pilot 3000,Lou, Have a nice future.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Cool! Just like in Star Trek! [The door closes on his head.] Ow!
Space Pilot 3000,Leela," Good afternoon, sir. [Fry is impressed with what he sees. Leela turns around. She has one huge eye in the middle of her face. Fry screams.] Name?"
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," Uh, Fry."
Space Pilot 3000,Leela," I'm Leela. Now, it's New Year's Eve so I'd like to decide your fate quickly and get out of here."
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Can I ask you a question?
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, As long as it's not about my eye.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Uh...
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, Is it about my eye?
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Sort of.
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, Just ask the question.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, What's with the eye?
Space Pilot 3000,Leela," I'm an alien, alright? Now let's drop the subject."
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," Cool, an alien! Has your race taken over the Earth?"
Space Pilot 3000,Leela," No, I just work here."
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Wait a minute! Is that blimp accurate?
Space Pilot 3000,Leela," Yep. It's December 31st, 2999."
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, My God! A million years!
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, I'm sure this must be very upsetting for you.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," Y'know, I guess it should be but, actually, I'm glad. I had nothing to live for in my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning to suspect my girlfriend might be cheating on me."
Space Pilot 3000,Leela," Well, at least here you'll be treated with dignity. Now strip naked and get on the probulator."
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, Interesting. Your DNA test shows one living relative. He's your great-great-great-great-great-great-great...
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, ...great-great-great-great-great nephew.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, That's great! What's the little guy's name?
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, Professor Hubert Farnsworth.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Eurgh!
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," Y'know, I'm the luckiest guy in the whole future. I've been given a second chance and this time I'm not going to be a total loser. [A buzzer buzzes.] What's that?"
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, Your permanent career assignment.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Delivery boy? No! Not again! Please! Anything else!
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, Take your hands off me! You've been assigned the job you're best at just like everyone else.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, What if I refuse?
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, Then you'll be fired--
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Fine!
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, Out of a cannon into the Sun!
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, But I don't like being a delivery boy.
Space Pilot 3000,Leela," Well that's tough! Lots of people don't like their jobs but we do them anyway. [She points at a poster of a man wearing a hardhat with the caption ""You Gotta Do What You Gotta Do"".] You gotta do what you gotta do. Now hold out your hand. I'm gonna implant your career chip. It'll permanently label you as a delivery boy."
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Keep that thing away from me!
Space Pilot 3000,Leela," Hold still, dammit. I don't have good depth perception! [She jumps at Fry, misses, and falls into a cryogenic freezer. It sets itself for 1000 years.] You've got until the count of five to let me out of here. One--"
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, See you in a thousand years! [He starts to walk out but hesitates. He walks back and changes the freeze time to five minutes.] You owe me one.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Whoa!
Space Pilot 3000,Man #1, JFK Jr. Airport.
Space Pilot 3000,Man #1, Radio City Mutant Hall.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Cool! [He steps into the tube.] Um. Cross Town Express?
Space Pilot 3000,Man #2, Pft! Tourist!
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," Hey! A phone booth! I can call my nephew. [An impatient robot joins the queue behind him. It is more or less human-shaped, grey, with an antenna on top of its head.] Wow! A real live robot! Or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?"
Space Pilot 3000,Bender, Bite my shiny metal ass.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, It doesn't look so shiny to me.
Space Pilot 3000,Bender," Shinier than yours, meatbag!"
Space Pilot 3000,Bender," Listen, buddy, I'm in a hurry here. Let's try for a two-fer!"
Space Pilot 3000,Booth Voice," Please select mode of death  ""Quick and Painless"" or ""Slow and Horrible""."
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," Yeah, I'd like to place a collect call."
Space Pilot 3000,Booth Voice," You have selected  ""Slow and Horrible""."
Space Pilot 3000,Bender," Great choice! [Knives, tasers and Jacob's Ladders come out from behind a hatch.] Bring it on, baby!"
Space Pilot 3000,Bender," C'mon, c'mon! Kill me already! By the way, my name's Bender!"
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Help! What's happening?
Space Pilot 3000,Booth Voice," You are now dead. Thank you for using Stop-N-Drop, America's favourite suicide booth since 2008."
Space Pilot 3000,Bender," Lousy, stinking rip-off! [He kicks the booth.] Well, I didn't have anything else planned for today. Let's go get drunk!"
Space Pilot 3000,Leela," Two, three-- Hey!"
Space Pilot 3000,Terry, [melodramatically] Welcome to the world of tomorrow!
Space Pilot 3000,Leela," Shut up, Terry."
Space Pilot 3000,Ipgee," This is unacceptable, Leela. You must find this Mr. Fry and install his chip."
Space Pilot 3000,Leela," Look, he's just a nobody who doesn't want to be a delivery boy. I'd really rather not force it on him."
Space Pilot 3000,Ipgee," Well that's your job, whether you like it or not. And it's my job to make you do your job whether I like it or not, which I do, very much! Now get to work! [Leela leaves. He puts his feet up on the desk.] Life is good!"
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Why would a robot need to drink?
Space Pilot 3000,Bender," I don't need to drink, I can quit anytime I want! [He belches fire.] So they made you a delivery boy, huh? Man, that's as bad as my job."
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," Really? What do you do, Bender?"
Space Pilot 3000,Bender," I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's all I'm programmed to do."
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, You any good at it?
Space Pilot 3000,Bender," You kidding? I was a star! I could bend a girder to any angle  30 degrees, 32 degrees, you name it! [unsure] 31. [normal] But I couldn't go on living once I found out what the girders were for."
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, What?
Space Pilot 3000,Bender," Suicide booths! [He finishes his drink and swallows the bottle.] Well, Fry, it was a pleasure meeting you. I'm gonna go kill myself."
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Wait! You're the only friend I have!
Space Pilot 3000,Bender, You really want a robot for a friend?
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," Yeah, ever since I was six."
Space Pilot 3000,Bender," Well, OK. But I don't want people thinking we're robo-sexuals. So, if anyone asks, you're my debugger."
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," Oh, no, it's the Cyclops! [He crouches down behind Bender.] Don't look! Don't look!"
Space Pilot 3000,Bender, I'm not looking!
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, This is officer 1B-DI requesting back-up.
Space Pilot 3000,Smitty, We'll be there in five minutes.
Space Pilot 3000,Bender, We can hide in here. It's free on Tuesdays!
Space Pilot 3000,Nimoy, Welcome to the Head Museum. I'm Leonard Nimoy.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Spock? Hey! Hey... Do the thing!
Space Pilot 3000,Nimoy, I don't do that anymore.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, This is unbelievable! What do you heads do all day?
Space Pilot 3000,Nimoy, We share our wisdom with those who seek it. It's a life of quiet dignity.
Space Pilot 3000,Woman, Feeding time!
Space Pilot 3000,Leela," Hmm. [She looks around and sees Fry and Bender hiding behind a shelf in amongst other assorted heads.] I'm sorry, Fry, but I have to install your career chip."
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," Yeah, well, if you're sorry why are you doing it?"
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, It's my job. You gotta do what you gotta do! [Fry backs away and hits a shelf with the heads of US presidents on it.] Watch it!
Space Pilot 3000,Nixon, That's it! You just made my list!
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," Ow! Stop it! Down, boy! Bad president!"
Space Pilot 3000,Smitty," Alright, buddy, step away from the head!"
Space Pilot 3000,URL, I'm gonna get 24th century on his ass!
Space Pilot 3000,Leela," Please, officers, there's no need to use force."
Space Pilot 3000,URL," Let us handle this, weird-y."
Space Pilot 3000,Leela," Oh, come on, he's just a poor kid from the Stupid Ages."
Space Pilot 3000,Smitty," Keep your big nose out of this, eyeball!"
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, No-one makes fun of my nose.
Space Pilot 3000,URL, Damn!
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, You guys were totally out of control.
Space Pilot 3000,Smitty, It's our job. We're peace officers.
Space Pilot 3000,URL," Yeah, you know the law  You gotta do what you gotta do."
Space Pilot 3000,Bender," Oh, we're trapped!"
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," Wait a second. You're a bender, right? We can get out of here if you just bend the bars."
Space Pilot 3000,Bender," Dream on, skin tube. I'm only programmed to bend for constructive purposes. What do I look like, a de-bender?"
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Who cares what you're programmed for. If someone programmed you to jump off a bridge would you do it?
Space Pilot 3000,Bender, I'll have to check my program ... yep.
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, [from outside] Open up!
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," C'mon, Bender! It's up to you to make your own decisions in life. That's what separates people and robots from animals ... and animal robots."
Space Pilot 3000,Bender," You're full of crap, Fry! [He turns and a dangling wire catches on his antenna and electrocutes him.] You make a persuasive argument, Fry."
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," Come on, Bender! You can do it."
Space Pilot 3000,Bender, Can't ... I ... can't ... do ... it!
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Yes!
Space Pilot 3000,Bender," You were right, Fry! From now on I'm going to bend what I want, when I want, who I want! I'm unstoppable!"
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, I don't know how you did that.
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, Wait!
Space Pilot 3000,Bender," [shouting] No, thanks."
Space Pilot 3000,Bender, Looks like one of us will have to bend this grate.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Good Lord! What is this?
Space Pilot 3000,Bender," It's the decaying ruins of Old New York. Welcome home, pal!"
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," It's my old neighbourhood. Man, this brings back a lot of memories."
Space Pilot 3000,Bender," Keep 'em to yourself, Pops!"
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, This is where I brought my girlfriend on our very first date.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, My God! She's gone. Everyone I ever knew or cared about is gone.
Space Pilot 3000,Bender, Wait! There's someone you know!
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," Oh, can't you leave me alone? I'm miserable enough already."
Space Pilot 3000,Leela," Look, I know it's not much consolation but I understand how you feel."
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," No, you don't. I've got no home, no family--"
Space Pilot 3000,Bender, No friends.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, My whole world is gone. You can't possibly understand what it feels like to be so alone.
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, I understand. I'm the only one-eyed alien on this whole planet. My parents abandoned me here as a baby and I don't even know what galaxy they were from. I know how it feels to be alone.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," Look, Leela, I don't understand this world but you obviously do, so I give up. If you really think I should be a delivery boy, I'll do it. [He holds out his hand to Leela. She gets the implant gun ready. Fry cringes and looks away. The gun clicks but Fry feels nothing. He opens his eyes and sees Leela drop her own chip on the floor.] Your chip. What are you doing?"
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, Quitting.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Why?
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, Because I've always wanted to. I just never realised it before I met you.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, What is the matter with you?
Space Pilot 3000,Bender, I just wanted to be part of the moment.
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, Hey! He stole my ring!
Space Pilot 3000,Bender," Sorry. [He hands Leela's ring back.] Well, that solves the mystery of the missing ring. This calls for a drink."
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, I don't wanna spoil the party but we're all job deserters now. We're unemployed and we have nowhere to go.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Correction  We're unemployed but we have a doddering old relative to mooch off of.
Space Pilot 3000,Clark," [on TV] Hello, I'm Dick Clark's head. Welcome to a special year 3000 edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve!"
Space Pilot 3000,Farnsworth, Who are you?
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, I'm your dear old Uncle Fry.
Space Pilot 3000,Farnsworth, I don't have an Uncle Fry.
Space Pilot 3000,Bender, You do now!
Space Pilot 3000,Farnsworth," By God, I am your nephew! This is absolutely incredible!"
Space Pilot 3000,Bender, Can we have some money?
Space Pilot 3000,Farnsworth," Oh, my, no."
Space Pilot 3000,Farnsworth, Let me show you around. That's my lab table and this is my work-stool. And over there is my intergalactic spaceship! [He points in the general direction of a big green spaceship in a huge hangar next to the lab.] And here's where I keep assorted lengths of wire.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Whoa! A real live spaceship!
Space Pilot 3000,Farnsworth, I designed it myself. Let me show you some of the different lengths of wire I used.
Space Pilot 3000,Smitty," [from outside] Attention, job deserters! Come out with your hands up. We have you partially surrounded."
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, No!
Space Pilot 3000,Nixon, Get those bums!
Space Pilot 3000,Bender," Well, we're boned!"
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, Can't we get away in the ship?
Space Pilot 3000,Farnsworth, I suppose it is technically possible. Though I am already in my pyjamas.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, I'll get us out of here.
Space Pilot 3000,Farnsworth, Can anyone drive stick?
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, I can. As long as I don't have to parallel park.
Space Pilot 3000,URL," If they try to take off, give 'em an ass-ful of laser."
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, Prepare for lift-off. Ten.
Space Pilot 3000,Crowd, [chanting] Nine!
Space Pilot 3000,Crowd, [chanting] Amania!
Space Pilot 3000,Crowd, [chanting] Seven!
Space Pilot 3000,Aliens, [chanting; in alien] Six.
Space Pilot 3000,Terry, [dramatically] Five!
Space Pilot 3000,Nimoy, Four.
Space Pilot 3000,Farnsworth, Three.
Space Pilot 3000,Bender, Two.
Space Pilot 3000,Leela, One!
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Blast-off!
Space Pilot 3000,Nixon, Fire! Fire!
Space Pilot 3000,Smitty, I can't see nothing. Pretty though!
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," So, I guess, without jobs, we'll be fugitives forever."
Space Pilot 3000,Farnsworth," Not necessarily. Are you three, by any chance, interested in becoming my new spaceship crew?"
Space Pilot 3000,Bender, New crew? W-What happened to the old crew?
Space Pilot 3000,Farnsworth, Of those poor sons of-- But that's not important. The important thing is I need a new crew. Anyone interested?
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Yes! Yes! That's exactly the job I've always wanted!
Space Pilot 3000,Leela," Thanks for the offer, Professor, but we don't have the proper career chips."
Space Pilot 3000,Farnsworth," Oh, that won't be a problem. As luck would have it, I saved the chips from my previous crew."
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, This is awesome! Are we gonna fly through space fighting monsters and teaching alien women to lurve?
Space Pilot 3000,Farnsworth," If by that you mean ""transporting cargo"" then yes. It's a little home business I started to fund my research."
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Cool! What's my job gonna be?
Space Pilot 3000,Farnsworth, You will be responsible for ensuring that the cargo reaches its destination.
Space Pilot 3000,Fry," So, I'm gonna be a delivery boy?"
Space Pilot 3000,Farnsworth, Exactly!
Space Pilot 3000,Fry, Alright! I'm a delivery boy!
Space Pilot 3000,,
A Flight to Remember,Leela, That was the worst delivery ever.
A Flight to Remember,Fry," Yeah. I'm never going to another planet called ""Cannibalon""!"
A Flight to Remember,Bender," Me neither. [upbeat] Food was good, though."
A Flight to Remember,Farnsworth," Oh, great news, everyone."
A Flight to Remember,Bender, Shove it! We quit!
A Flight to Remember,Farnsworth, In that case I'll have to hire a new crew to go on our company vacation.
A Flight to Remember,Leela, Vacation?
A Flight to Remember,Bender, Alright!
A Flight to Remember,Fry, This is great! I haven't had time off since I was 21 through 24.
A Flight to Remember,Farnsworth, It's just my way of thanking you for not reporting my countless violations of safety and minimum wage laws.
A Flight to Remember,Bender," Aww, you!"
A Flight to Remember,Farnsworth," I've booked us all on the maiden voyage of the largest, most luxurious space cruise ship ever built. [He pulls out a brochure.] The Titanic!"
A Flight to Remember,Leela, Looks nice.
A Flight to Remember,Fry," Hey, uh, where's my suitcase? [His suitcase flies out from the tube and knocks him over.] Ow!"
A Flight to Remember,Poopenmeyer," As Mayor of New New York, it's my pleasure to introduce the honorary captain for the Titanic's maiden voyage. A man who single-handedly defeated the Retiree People of the Assisted Living Nebula  Zapp Brannigan!"
A Flight to Remember,Leela," Oh, God! Not Zapp Brannigan!"
A Flight to Remember,Zoidberg, You know Zapp Brannigan?
A Flight to Remember,Leela," Let's just say we've ""crossed paths""."
A Flight to Remember,Bender, Was that before or after you slept with him?
A Flight to Remember,Zapp," She's a beautiful ship, alright. Shapely ... seductive. I'm gonna fly her brains out. [The crowd applauds. Zapp holds up his hand and they stop.] And now, without further adieu, I christen this ship, Titanic."
A Flight to Remember,Zapp," Well, well, well! The Lady Leela. Take notes, Kif. You're about to witness the subtle waltz known as seduction. [Kif sighs. Leela stops as Zapp blocks her way.] So, trapped on a ship with me. What say you and I knock some very sensual boots?"
A Flight to Remember,Leela," It's tempting, but, uh, I have a fiancé now. Uh, hmm, uh, hmm, uh, we--, uh ... [She repeatedly looks at Farnsworth, Zoidberg and Fry, makes a quick decision, then pulls Fry forward.] Him! Fry, darling, meet Zapp Brannigan."
A Flight to Remember,Fry, Huh? [Leela eblows him.] Ooh! How do you do?
A Flight to Remember,Farnsworth," Ah, here's my stateroom."
A Flight to Remember,Bender," Come on, where is it?"
A Flight to Remember,Farnsworth," Now, Hermes, you and your lovely wife, LaBarbara, have the suite through there. And Dr. Zoidberg, your marble tank is on the other side."
A Flight to Remember,Fry," Man, first class seems nice!"
A Flight to Remember,Farnsworth, It'll seem even nicer once you've seen your room.
A Flight to Remember,Amy, Looks like we're on the Fiesta Deck.
A Flight to Remember,Leela, This is it.
A Flight to Remember,Fry, Well at least we get a window!
A Flight to Remember,Bender," Well, I'm tired of this room and everyone in it. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna pop over to the casino for the next 135 hours!"
A Flight to Remember,Amy, I think I'll go and fill up on bisque at the buffet.
A Flight to Remember,Fry, I guess that just leaves you and your fake fianc´ ... all alone ... on a romantic cruise.
A Flight to Remember,Leela, Take it off or I'll break it off.
A Flight to Remember,Fry, OK!
A Flight to Remember,Zapp, Captain's inspection!
A Flight to Remember,Bender," Hmm. [Through his eyes we see his cheat unit predicting the dice. He chuckles.] I'm bettin' it all! [He empties the chips from his chest cabinet.] Come on, baby needs a new pair of feet!"
A Flight to Remember,Croupier, Snake eyes.
A Flight to Remember,Bender, No! My cheating unit malfunctioned! You gotta give me a do-over!
A Flight to Remember,Croupier," Sorry, the house limit is three do-overs. Next shooter."
A Flight to Remember,Bender," Gimmie you're biggest, strongest, cheapest drink."
A Flight to Remember,iZac, You got it!
A Flight to Remember,Bender, Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bender.
A Flight to Remember,Countess, Charmed. I'm the Countess de la Roca. I was surprised to see another robot staying in first class. Most of the robots I meet are labourers.
A Flight to Remember,Bender," I assure you, I barely know the meaning of the word ""labour""."
A Flight to Remember,Countess," Oh, Mr. Bender!"
A Flight to Remember,Bender," Please, call me Bender."
A Flight to Remember,Countess," [embarrassed] Oh, goodness. I don't--"
A Flight to Remember,Zapp," Kif, I'm feeling the captain's itch."
A Flight to Remember,Kif," I'll get the powder, sir."
A Flight to Remember,Zapp," No, the itch for adventure! Prepare to change course."
A Flight to Remember,Kif," Sir, this is a leisure cruise. Our path was set by the travel agency."
A Flight to Remember,Zapp, That's for schoolgirls! Now here's a route with some chest hair.
A Flight to Remember,Kif, But that course leads directly through a swarm of comets.
A Flight to Remember,Zapp," Yes, comets! The icebergs of the sky. By jack-knifing from one to the next at breakneck speed we might just get some kind of gravity boost ... or something. [Kif sighs.] It's time to shove a jalapeño up this ships tailpipe. [He grabs the wheel.] Divert power from the shields, full speed ahead!"
A Flight to Remember,Amy," Oh, yeah!"
A Flight to Remember,Mrs. Wong, Amy! Hello!
A Flight to Remember,Amy, Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?
A Flight to Remember,Mr. Wong," We were planning on enjoying a relaxing vacation. But since you're here, we'll have to do some meddling."
A Flight to Remember,Mrs. Wong, We met the nicest boy in the cabin next to ours.
A Flight to Remember,Mr. Wong, He's not very ugly.
A Flight to Remember,Mrs. Wong, You should marry him! Or at least use him to conceive a grandchild for us.
A Flight to Remember,Mr. Wong, There he is at the buffet!
A Flight to Remember,Amy," Uh, he seems really nice but, well, I already have a boyfriend."
A Flight to Remember,Mrs. Wong, Really? Where is he?
A Flight to Remember,Mr. Wong, And why isn't he here right now fathering our grandchild?
A Flight to Remember,Amy, Uh...
A Flight to Remember,Leela," Well, our accommodations aren't great, but it sure is beautiful out here."
A Flight to Remember,Fry," Yeah, it's pretty romantic-- Uh, I mean platonic. Th-That sure is one platonic view!"
A Flight to Remember,Leela," Fry, just be quiet. I'm beginning to think this whole fake fiancé thing was a terrible, terrible--"
A Flight to Remember,Fry, Hmm? Mmm!
A Flight to Remember,Zapp," Leela, perhaps this is an awkward time but if things don't work out with this pipsqueak here ... [He puts his hand on her shoulder.] ... I just want you to know I'll be there to score you on the rebound."
A Flight to Remember,Leela," Uh, look, before you get any crazy ideas, that was for Zapp."
A Flight to Remember,Fry," Well, you got anything else for him?"
A Flight to Remember,Leela," Alright, can we try not to complicate this?"
A Flight to Remember,Amy," Mom, Dad, I'd like you to meet Fry, my boyfriend."
A Flight to Remember,Fry, Hmm? Mmm!
A Flight to Remember,Fry," See you later, wuvvums!"
A Flight to Remember,Leela, It would have been nice if you'd told me you were going out with Amy.
A Flight to Remember,Fry," I'm not going out with Amy. It's just to fool her parents. Hey, you're not jealous, are you?"
A Flight to Remember,Leela, What? No. No! Of course not!
A Flight to Remember,Fry," Good, 'cause I consider my fake relationship with you a lot more meaningful."
A Flight to Remember,Countess, Mind if I freshen up a bit before we go out?
A Flight to Remember,Bender, I was just about to suggest the same thing. [The Countess giggles then disappears into the bathroom. The sound of a power tool comes from the room. Bender rubs his hands with glee. He rummages through her drawers and sees a bracelet on the table. He picks it up and chuckles.] Pay dirt!
A Flight to Remember,Countess," Lovely, isn't it?"
A Flight to Remember,Bender, Yeah. But only 93% as lovely as you.
A Flight to Remember,Countess," Oh, Bender! Either that was a computing error or you're the most romantic robot I've ever met!"
A Flight to Remember,Bender," I don't get it, iZac; that bracelet had a diamond the size of a racoon's brain. Why couldn't I steal it?"
A Flight to Remember,iZac," It's obvious, Mr. B. You're in love."
A Flight to Remember,Bender," Oh, it's true. But we're star-crossed robots. She, a countess, built with a silver spoon in her mouth. And me, just a regular honest Joe."
A Flight to Remember,iZac," Hey, you gonna pay for those?"
A Flight to Remember,Bender," Hell, no!"
A Flight to Remember,iZac, Security to bar area. Security to bar area.
A Flight to Remember,Bender," Fellas, please. I'm in love!"
A Flight to Remember,iZac, Rough him up!
A Flight to Remember,Countess, What are you doing?
A Flight to Remember,iZac," This penniless chump was stealing drinks, ma'am."
A Flight to Remember,Countess," I see. Here you are, sir. [She hands iZac some money.] Keep the change."
A Flight to Remember,iZac, You got it!
A Flight to Remember,Zoidberg, Aha!
A Flight to Remember,Fry," Go, Professor!"
A Flight to Remember,Amy, Lean back more!
A Flight to Remember,Farnsworth, Ow!
A Flight to Remember,LaBarbara," Come on, Hermes, you could out-limbo all of these people!"
A Flight to Remember,Hermes," Don't be a dog heart, woman. You know I can't. Not after what happened."
A Flight to Remember,Announcer," [on loudspeaker] Now limbo-ing for the Earth team, Hermes Conrad."
A Flight to Remember,Boy," [shouting] You're my hero, Hermes! I'm gonna be just like you!"
A Flight to Remember,Hermes," No, boy, stop! It's too low! Your backbone can't take it!"
A Flight to Remember,Boy, I'm just like Hermes! I'm just like--
A Flight to Remember,Hermes, [screaming] Nooo!
A Flight to Remember,LaBarbara," There, there. Now you don't have to limbo if you don't want. It doesn't make you any less of a man."
A Flight to Remember,Farnsworth, Though it did get me some action!
A Flight to Remember,Hattie, I like a man who's flexible!
A Flight to Remember,Zapp," Your attention, please. As captain of this vessel, the terrible burden of naming a limbo contest winner is mine and mine alone."
A Flight to Remember,Kif, Shouldn't you be steering between the comets?
A Flight to Remember,Zapp," And the winner is, Leela!"
A Flight to Remember,Leela, But I didn't even limbo.
A Flight to Remember,Zapp," No matter. I know from personal experience how horizontal you can get. As your reward, you and that hairpile are invited to dine at the captain's table this evening."
A Flight to Remember,Bender," Well, now you know. I'm not actually rich. I'm a fraud. A poor, lazy, sexy fraud. This isn't even a real bow-tie, it's magnetic."
A Flight to Remember,Countess," Bender, I don't care whether you have money. I love you for your artificial intelligence and your sincerity simulator."
A Flight to Remember,Bender, You do? Really?
A Flight to Remember,Zapp," I like your style, Fry. You remind me of a young me. Not much younger, mind you. Perhaps even a couple of years older."
A Flight to Remember,Fry," Thank you, sir."
A Flight to Remember,Zapp," As a gentleman, I must warn you. If you so much as glance at another woman, I'll be all over Leela like a fly on a pile of very seductive manure."
A Flight to Remember,Fry," Well, rest assured, Leela's the only girl for me."
A Flight to Remember,Amy," Hey, Fry."
A Flight to Remember,Leela, Amy!
A Flight to Remember,Amy, Leela!
A Flight to Remember,Zapp," Ah, the family Wong. Our party is complete."
A Flight to Remember,Leela, [whispering] What are we gonna do? Fry can't pretend to be both our boyfriends.
A Flight to Remember,Fry, [whispering] Sure I can. I learned how to handle delicate social situations from a little show called Three's Company.
A Flight to Remember,Zapp, I'd like to impose a toast on the happy couple. Down the hatch!
A Flight to Remember,Mrs. Wong," Hear, hear! Now let's have a kiss!"
A Flight to Remember,Zapp," Yes, Fry. Plant one on your woman."
A Flight to Remember,Fry," Um, let me think. Come and knock on our door, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh. Uh, Mr. Roper--"
A Flight to Remember,Mr. Wong, What's the hold up? Kiss my daughter already!
A Flight to Remember,Farnsworth," Wait, I'm confused. Now tell me, Fry, which one of these ladies are you involved with?"
A Flight to Remember,Fry, Uh...
A Flight to Remember,Kif," Captain, may I have a word with you?"
A Flight to Remember,Zapp, No.
A Flight to Remember,Kif," It's an emergency, sir."
A Flight to Remember,Zapp," Come back when it's a catastrophe. [There is a crash and the ship shakes. Zapp reluctantly stands up.] Oh, very well."
A Flight to Remember,Amy," Well, with Zapp gone and my parents still here, I suggest Fry give me a nice, convincing kiss."
A Flight to Remember,Fry," Ah, now there's something we can all enjoy."
A Flight to Remember,Kif," Sir, remember your course correction?"
A Flight to Remember,Zapp, No.
A Flight to Remember,Kif, Well it's proving somewhat more suicidal than we'd initially hoped.
A Flight to Remember,Zapp," Kif, old friend, I don't know which disgusts me more  Your cowardice or your stupidity! We'll simply set a new course for that empty region over there. Near that black-ish hole-ish thing."
A Flight to Remember,Fry," Hey, Leela, why'd you run off from dinner?"
A Flight to Remember,Leela, I didn't run off. I had plenty of time to finish eating and stroll away while you were kissing Amy.
A Flight to Remember,Fry," Oh, look, I'm not actually interested in her if that's what's bothering you."
A Flight to Remember,Leela," Oh, are you sure? I mean, she has two eyes, you have two eyes."
A Flight to Remember,Fry," I know, we seem like a perfect match, but I just don't feel that way about her."
A Flight to Remember,Leela, Nice nebula.
A Flight to Remember,Fry, Yeah.
A Flight to Remember,Leela, Look's like everybody's got somebody. Except me.
A Flight to Remember,Fry, And me.
A Flight to Remember,Leela," What was that? [She looks over the railings and sees.] Oh, my God! We're heading straight into a black hole."
A Flight to Remember,Fry, Talk about a mood killer!
A Flight to Remember,Zapp," Don't blame yourself, Kif. We were doomed from the start. Nothing remains now but for the captain to go down with his ship."
A Flight to Remember,Kif," Why, that's surprisingly noble of you, sir."
A Flight to Remember,Zapp," No, it's noble of you, Kif! [He tears his captain's patch off.] As of now ... [He puts the patch on Kif.] ... you're in command. Congratulations, captain!"
A Flight to Remember,Leela, OK. We just have to get from here to the escape pods.
A Flight to Remember,Farnsworth, [shouting] I'm too young to die!
A Flight to Remember,Leela," Come on, before it's too late!"
A Flight to Remember,Bender," You all go without me. I'm gonna take one last look around. You know, for, uh, stuff to steal."
A Flight to Remember,Fry," You're going back or the Countess, aren't you?"
A Flight to Remember,Bender," [whispering] Alright, I am. But I don't want the others to know. If I don't come back, just say I died robbing some old man."
A Flight to Remember,Fry," I'll tell them you went out prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger."
A Flight to Remember,Bender," I love you, buddy!"
A Flight to Remember,Bender, [shouting] Countess? Countess?
A Flight to Remember,Countess, [shouting] Bender!
A Flight to Remember,Countess, [shouting] I fell through the deck.
A Flight to Remember,Bender," [shouting] Are you hurt, my sweet?"
A Flight to Remember,Countess, [shouting] No. Luckily a family broke my fall.
A Flight to Remember,Bender, Just hang on! I'll take care of that fire!
A Flight to Remember,Countess," Bender, you risked your life to save me."
A Flight to Remember,Bender," And I'd do it again. And perhaps a third time. But that would be it. [They kiss.] When we kiss, I feel like I'm standing waist-deep in a pool of cold, rising water."
A Flight to Remember,Leela, Hurry! The escape pods should be just ahead!
A Flight to Remember,Hermes, [gasping] Faster!
A Flight to Remember,Leela, It won't move. And the door release is on the other side.
A Flight to Remember,Fry, Then we're dead meat. No one could squeeze under there!
A Flight to Remember,Hermes," No one, except a legendary limbo champion."
A Flight to Remember,LaBarbara," Oh, Hermes!"
A Flight to Remember,Hermes, Ooh! It's been a while. [He leans back and tries to go under the door. His knees hit it.] This one is for that little kid who's limbo-ing up in heaven right now.
A Flight to Remember,LaBarbara," That's my man, alright, baby, limbo!"
A Flight to Remember,Hermes," I still got the moves! Zoidberg, lower the door another inch."
A Flight to Remember,LaBarbara," Just go on through and hit the release, you hot dog!"
A Flight to Remember,Hermes," Yes, dear."
A Flight to Remember,LaBarbara, That's my man!
A Flight to Remember,Amy," Yay, Hermes!"
A Flight to Remember,Hermes," Uh, can somebody help me up?"
A Flight to Remember,Countess," Well, now what are we going to do?"
A Flight to Remember,Bender, Wait a second. Aren't you a member of the yacht club?
A Flight to Remember,Countess," By God, you're right! I'm a class-3 yacht."
A Flight to Remember,Farnsworth, Thank God there are plenty of escape pods. We won't have to dress up like women and children.
A Flight to Remember,Leela, We can't leave yet. We've got to wait for Bender. The high gravity must be slowing down his looting.
A Flight to Remember,Mrs. Wong, Amy!
A Flight to Remember,Amy, Mom? Dad? You're alive!
A Flight to Remember,Mr. Wong," Yeah, but so what? The important thing is we found you a new man."
A Flight to Remember,Mrs. Wong, A captain.
A Flight to Remember,Amy," Uh, Mom, I don't-- [Enter Kif.] Hi!"
A Flight to Remember,Kif, [sexfully] Hello!
A Flight to Remember,Farnsworth, I don't feel well!
A Flight to Remember,Fry, Look! It's our nebula. Whenever I see it I'll think back to that moment when we almost-- [The nebula is sucked into the black hole.] Never mind!
A Flight to Remember,Hermes, Everyone else is off the ship. Where in Babylon is Bender?
A Flight to Remember,Leela, I don't know. But we can't wait any longer.
A Flight to Remember,Fry," Goodbye, Bender."
A Flight to Remember,Bender, [shouting] Wait for us!
A Flight to Remember,Leela, Something's wrong. We're two metric tons overweight.
A Flight to Remember,Amy," Well, it's not me!"
A Flight to Remember,Fry, Look!
A Flight to Remember,Countess," I'm slipping, Bender. The pull is too strong!"
A Flight to Remember,Bender," I can't live without you. If you let go, I let go!"
A Flight to Remember,Countess," No! You have too much to live for. It may hurt for a while but one day you'll share your love again. After all, it's shareware."
A Flight to Remember,Bender, Don't talk like that. Tragic romances always have a happy ending.
A Flight to Remember,Countess, [shouting] Farewell!
A Flight to Remember,Bender, [shouting] No!
A Flight to Remember,Bender, She's gone.
A Flight to Remember,Leela," But she saved all our lives. Without her, we're light enough to get away."
A Flight to Remember,Fry," Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows what happens in a black hole. It's possible she's still alive in another dimension somewhere. Right, Professor?"
A Flight to Remember,Farnsworth," Oh, yes, absolutely! [He turns to Zoidberg.] Not a chance!"
A Flight to Remember,Bender, At least I'll always have her bracelet! [He hands it to Hermes.] What do you think it's worth?
A Flight to Remember,Hermes," It's fake, mon!"
A Flight to Remember,,
The Mutants Are Revolting,,
The Mutants Are Revolting,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. We've been hired to make our 100th delivery."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Zoidberg, 100!
The Mutants Are Revolting,Hermes, That's almost 10 per year.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Bender," This calls for a party, baby. I'm ordering a hundred kegs, a hundred hookers, and a hundred Elvis impersonators who aren't above a little hooking, should the occasion arise!"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Elzar," [He pushes a soufflé on a cart.] Be very gentle, folks. This is the soufflé you'll be delivering to Mrs. Astor."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Bender," Oh my God, it's Elzar! Hi, Elzar! Great soufflé, Elzar!"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Elzar," Whatever you do, don't drop it. [He holds up a bottle labeled ""Nitroglycerine. Danger! Explosive.""] See, Mrs. Astor takes nitroglycerine for her heart, and being a class act, she prefers it in soufflé form. [He lets a drop of nitroglycerine soak into the soufflé.] [Softly.] Bam."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Farnsworth," To prevent the soufflé from exploding, Bender will carry it. He's gyroscopically stable."
The Mutants Are Revolting,,
The Mutants Are Revolting,Farnsworth," Look, Mrs. Astor's mansion, just across that rickety rope bridge. [Part of the bridge falls off.]"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Amy," Wow, it's ricketier than it looks. You'd better try to jump it, Bender."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Bender," Okay, let me back up for a running start. [He runs backwards,  all the way around the asteroid, across the bridge, back to where he started. He then runs forwards, crossing the bridge and ends up near the crew again. He jumps across the gap. The rest of the crew walk up. Fry rings the doorbell.]"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Hobsy, [He opens the door.] I shall inform Mrs. Astor that the circus is in town.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Hobsy," Your soufflé, Madam."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor," I shall take it here, under my fork."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Zoidberg, Where's the exploding?
The Mutants Are Revolting,Hobsy, One does not explode in Mrs. Astor's face.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor, I couldn't eat another bite. Hobsy?
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor," Well done, sir. Have you a name?"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Farnsworth," Hubert Farnsworth, at your service."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor," A Farnsworth, you say? Well, if I'm not mistaken, the Farnsworths have been in New New York for almost two hundred years."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Farnsworth," Yes, I have."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry, And I'm his uncle!
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor, How charmingly unconventional.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry, I can eat a hotdog underwater.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor," Say, would you Farnsworths care to be my guests tomorrow at the Astor Endowment Fundraiser? All the best families will be there."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry, We can take 'em.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor," [Narrating for an old black-and-white film.] On April 10, 2912, my late husband and I set off down Fifth Avenue aboard the Land Titanic, the largest street-going vessel ever built. [In the film, the Land Titanic takes off. People are watching it sail.] Just four days into her maiden voyage, as we approached 32 Street, the line-liner struck a mailbox and went down. [In the film, we see one of the Land Titanic's wheels hit a mailbox. The ship starts falling through the street.]  2000 souls were lost that day, including my dear husband. In loving memory, I established the Mr. Astor Endowment, which this year supports the United Mutant Scholarship Fund."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry, [to Leela] Mutants? That's the kind of thing you are.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela," Shh. You know mutants aren't allowed on the surface. If anyone asks, say I'm an alien, remember?"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry, Right. You gonna finish that roll?
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela, Shh.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor, Now a short film about those pitiable creatures so in need of our charity.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Narrator," Far beneath the everyday rumble of limousines and poodle feet, there toil a downtrodden people even less well off than the upper middle class. [The film goes from a busy street to the sewers, where mutants are working.] The noble sewer mutants. For you see, generations of exposure to toxic sewage mutated them into horrific monsters! [Leela's parents, along with Dwayne, Vyolet, Raoul are shown on screen. Fry and the Professor scream.]"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela, Shut up!
The Mutants Are Revolting,Narrator," These industrious, uh, people, I guess, maintain the various pipes and poop chutes that keep decent, above-ground society functioning. [More mutants are shown working on pipes and toilets.] And where do these proud toileteers learn their menial skills? At Brown University, the nation's premier institution of lower learning. So please, give generously, knowing some poor helpless mutant will thank you. Not in person, thank God!"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela," Well, that was disturbing."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor," Oh, I understand, dear. They are hideous."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela," Look, I guess you mean well, but isn't that university just a tax-deductible sewer-cleaning service?"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor," My dear, that school is about much more than sewer pipes."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela, Really?
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor," It's also about keeping those filthy things busy. There are thousands of them down there, breeding like rats."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Royalty girl, [To Calculon.] My great uncle once saw a rat.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor," If we don't keep them busy, they'll start jabbering on about equal rights in their ill-bred manner."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela," Let's go. If I say one more thing, I might say it with my evening boot."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor, Well! Rarely have I never!
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," Please, don't blame Leela. She's just a little ill-bred. You know how mutants are."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor, You companion is a mutant?
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," But if anyone asks, say she's an alien."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor, Help! Police!
The Mutants Are Revolting,URL," You may have eluded the authorities, but don't nothing get past Mrs. Astor. [He and Smitty take Leela away.]"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela, [Being led outside.] What's gonna happen to me?
The Mutants Are Revolting,Smitty," Permanent deportation, you mutant."
The Mutants Are Revolting,URL," You going downtown, baby. Way down. [They drop Leela down a man-hole.]"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Raoul, Incoming!
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela," Thanks, Colonel."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Colonel," Just doing my job, ma'am. [He salutes with his tongue.]"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela," Oh, Mom, Dad, I can't believe I have to spend the rest of my life in this hellhole. [She pauses as her parents look shocked.] I'm sorry."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Turanga Munda," It's okay, sweetie. Now that you're here, this hellhole feels more like a nice, regular hole."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Turanga Morris," What do ya say we go get some sewer coffee, sewer cake, and Safeway ice cream?"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Bender," [He bursts out of a cooler.] Well, the bottom's all stocked with cheap stuff. Who's in the mood to party? [He waves Fry's arms around.] Whoo!"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," Poor, Leela. I feel like I ruined her life."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Hermes, You did ruin her life.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," You might be right, Hermes."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Hermes, I am right.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry, I almost feel like we should do something to help her.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Hermes, We should do something!
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," I don't care what you say, Hermes. Let's go."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," Oh, mighty mayor. We're here about Turanga Leela."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Poopenmeyer, You mean Leela?
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," Right. I mean sure, she's a mutant, we've known that for years. But we kept it a secret because she's a fine, upstanding..."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Poopenmeyer, Wait. You knowingly attempted to harbor a mutant?
The Mutants Are Revolting,Hermes, We did harbor a mutant! Uh-oh.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Munda," Look, Leela, there's Old Filthful. [She points to a geyser. It shoots up sewage and mutants take pictures before being covered by the sewage.]"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela, Urgh!
The Mutants Are Revolting,Morris," And there's the West Side Pipeway. [He points to some mutants working on a pipeline.] If those guys slack off for even a second, it could explode. [To the workers.] Hey, guys! This is my daughter, Leela."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Morris," Well, they're with the chuds, now."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela," These conditions are deplorable. I swear, I hate every single person on the surface for making us live like this."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry, Leela!
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela, What are you doing here?
The Mutants Are Revolting,Amy, We were sentence to two weeks in the sewer for harboring a mutant.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Zoidberg, Three dollars at the drug store.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," I'm so sorry I ratted you out, but, you know, after two weeks down here, I'll truly understand the plight of the mutant people."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela, How dare you? You wanna understand something? Look at that lake. One dip in that toxic muck and your DNA will be permanently mutated. You'll grow a camel hump or a Zoidberg face.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Zoidberg, Urgh!
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela, You wanna know what it's like to be a mutant? Jump in and go for a swim.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," I would, but I ate a bunch of potato salad, so..."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela," Yeah, that's what I thought. You are all surface."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Bender," Fry! Hermes! Where my humans are? Ah, who cares? It is on."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Horrible Gelatinous Blob," Hey, hey, hey."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Hedonism Bot, I trust the orgy pit has been scraped and buttered?
The Mutants Are Revolting,Bender," You know it, and there's mini-quiches, too."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Hermes, It's getting cold and smelly. My odor-eaters(?) are going critical. [An attachment on his shoes is glowing brightly.]
The Mutants Are Revolting,Zoidberg, Maybe we can plotz in that giant cockle. [He points to a bus.]
The Mutants Are Revolting,Amy," Shmeepers, it's the Land Titanic, the biggest and onlyest land boat ever constructed..."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Hermes, This was one hell of a bus.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Zoidberg," Well, everyone debone a bunk and get some shut-eye. [He removes the skeleton.]"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Farnsworth," Zoidberg, show some respect! This is a sacred shrine to the thousands who lost their lives."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Amy," [off screen.] Hey, I found a safe!"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Farnsworth, It's coming loose. Hand me some more of that cruise director. [Amy hands him a leg bone which he uses to pry off the lock. The door opens.] The original passenger manifests. [He hands them to Hermes.]
The Mutants Are Revolting,Hermes, Spreadsheets were so elegant back then.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Farnsworth," Just one other item. [He opens a case, revealing a Quantum Gemerald.]"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Amy," It's jewelry. Jewelry! It's jewelry, people!"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Farnsworth," It's a priceless quantum-force gemerald. [He uses it to blast the cruise director, turning the skeleton to an ash stain on the wall.]"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Zoidberg, What's that enscribbled on it?
The Mutants Are Revolting,Hermes," [He reads the inscription.] ""My dear Mrs. Astor. My love for you is as unsinkable as this land ship and as brilliant as this stone. Dictated but not read, Mr. Astor."""
The Mutants Are Revolting,Amy, Aw! That's so valuable.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," Yeah, I'll never have love like that. Leela hates me now. [He sniffles.] [Voice breaking.] Did you guys know I have a crush on Leela? [The Professor slaps him with the cruise director's arm.]"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Munda," What's a matter, Leela? You've hardly touched your toilet clams."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela, [She sighs.] Maybe I was too harsh on Fry. He didn't ruin my life on purpose.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Morris," Things will work out, honey. Now here, have some more of what looks like lemonade. [He fills Leela's glass with a yellow liquid.]"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Bubblegum," Bender, I've been to wang dang doodles all up and down the galaxy, but this is the dangest wang I ever doodled."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Bender," Oh, yeah! Come on baby, let's do it. [He backflips to the upper level and dances on the railing.] Shake your booty, baby. Come on, yeah! [He sees the picture of the crew posing for a commemorative photo celebrating the 100th delivery. Bender jumps down and unplugs the stereo. The DJ Robot and Fender both fall over.] Get out! Get out! It's not fun anymore! I wanna be alone!"
The Mutants Are Revolting,<poem>Hedonism Bot, Alone with me?
The Mutants Are Revolting,Bender," I said scram, grapey! [Everyone leaves.]"
The Mutants Are Revolting,[Scene, Land Titanic. Fry is the only one still awake. He gets up and walks out of the bus.]
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela, Fry? What are you doing.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry, [Taking off his clothes.] You were right. I don't know what it's like to be a mutant. But I want to know.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela," Wait, I never meant for you to... [Fry jumps into the mutagenic lake.] Oh, no! [Time Lapse. She is rowing a boat to where Fry is.] Fry! Fry! No! No! [She reaches in and pulls something out. Fry has become a blob. He has grown an extra eye and tentacles.]"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry, Any effect?
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela, [She starts to scream but stops and vomits into the lake.] Sorry. I tried to scream but I barfed.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry, I think I'm knowing what it's like to be a mutant.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Zoidberg," So, what's with all the screaming?"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," Hey, guys."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela," Fry, this is the stupidest, sweetest thing you've ever done. And you know, maybe now, together, we can be an inspiration to other mutants."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," I hope so, Leela."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela, Aw. Come here. Let me give you a kiss. [Fry puckers up.] Hug. [Fry opens his arms.] Handshake. [Fry sticks out a hand.] I'll text ya.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," My fellow mutants, until recently, I dwelt on the surface where a man can gaze up at the sky in wonder without a wet clump falling in his mouth."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mutant, [off screen.] We can do that too. [He is hit by a wet clump.]
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela," Who's ready to fight for equality? [The crowd cheers.] The Devolution Revolution has begun! Beautiful mutants, please welcome Devo!"
The Mutants Are Revolting,[The band walks on stage.],
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mutated Mark Mothersbaugh," Hello, Sewer City. [The mutants cheer.] As long-time mutants ourselves, we support your righteous struggle and will do anything we can for you."
The Mutants Are Revolting,<poem>Dwayne," Play ""Whip It""!"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mutated Mark Mothersbaugh, No. [To a member of the band.] Play the other one.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela," Now that we got their attention, it's time to hit them where they sit, by bending the West Side Pipeway to return all sewage to the surface."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry, But who could possibly bend such a huge pipe?
The Mutants Are Revolting,Bender," So lonely. Poor, sad Bender."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," Hey, buddy."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Bender," [He recoils, screaming. He stops.] Ah, what the heck? [He hugs Fry and sinks into Fry's body.]"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mutants, Bend it! Bend it! Bend it!
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," What goes down, must back up!"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Sal, [While wading through the sewage.] Yucks. I picked the wrong day to wear my new Crocses.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela, Prepare to storm the surface for the Million Mutant March.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Colonel," Move out, Fry. We need out most disgusting mutant leading the charge."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry, [He is looking at the Land Titanic's manifest.] I'll meet you up there. I need to check out something first.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Colonel," Okay. Vyolet, you're up front."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Vyolet, Hey!
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor," Mayor, this sewage debacle has gone on long enough. As your largest campaign contributor, I demand action!"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Poopenmeyer, Very well. $80 worth of action it is.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Poopenmeyer, Voilà! We simply pump the fruits of our excretion into Madison Cube Garden.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor," Well, it seems everything is under... [She gasps. The mutants are coming out of the sewers.]"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Vyolet, Two!
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mutated Mark Mothersbaugh, Four!
The Mutants Are Revolting,Colonel, Six eyes!
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mutants, The mutant people will arise.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela," The segregation of the mutant people ends today. We demand equal rights, equal access to the surface, and the blood of your first-born children. [Softly. To Raoul.] That so we have something to give up at the negotiations."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor," I've never been so moved, and I see no reason to begin now. Hobsy, flush those creatures back into the hole they crawled out of."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Hobsy, Madam's sewage seeking missile.[He presents an I See BM and activates it.]
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," [He bursts out of a manhole, holding the gemerald.] Let my people stay! [He shoots a beam of energy at the wave of sewage, parting it."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Bender, Neat! [He takes a picture with his purple camera.]
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," Mrs. Astor, deep in the sewers, we discovered the wreck of the Land Titanic, on which your husband land-drowned. Inside was something that might interest you."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor," The gemerald ring that my husband was to give me in lieu of children. [She holds it up then throws it away.] So what, I have a chandelier in my car made of those."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," Not the gem. This passenger manifest. It turns out there were mutants on that ship, working below deck in the sewage galley."
The Mutants Are Revolting,[Leela helps a mutant out of the manhole.] Ma'am?,
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela's grandmother," I was just a young girl. [A flashback starts. She is cleaning a pipe.] Drain angels, they called us. When the ship started going down. [Mutants can be seen fleeing. Leela's great-grandmother picks up her grandmother.] My mother grabbed me and made for the nearest life-car. [Mutants can be seen trying to get onto the cars.] But the places were all taken by surface passengers. As my mother held me tight, I suddenly felt the gentle tap of a cane on my face. I turned to see the kindly smile of Mr. Astor. [In the present, Mrs. Astor looks on in shock. Hobsy covers a second missile.] [In the flashback, Mr. Astor gets up and offers them his seat. They rush into the car as the ship goes down and flashback ends.] Thanks to your husband's humanity, I lived to raise my own daughter, and she, a daughter in turn."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela," Mom, why have I never heard this?"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Munda, [Whispering.] My mother's nuts.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," I beg you, Mrs. Astor, if you truly want to honor your husband's memory, treat these people with dignity, as he did."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor," Oh, he was a dear man, Mr. Astor. [To Poopenmeyer.] Randall, let's grant these mutants their freedom."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Poopenmeyer, Okay.
The Mutants Are Revolting,Dwayne, Are we not men now?
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mutated Mark Mothersbaugh," I'm forty percent potato, but close enough."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela," Thank you, Fry. I think maybe I can stomach that kiss now."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry, What the...?
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mr. Astor," Good afternoon. I am Mr. Astor. I did not perish that fateful day, but rather plummeted into the toxic lake, where I mutated and lived in solitude until this ruddy lad here stepped into my mouth and lodged there."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Mrs. Astor, Mister? Is that really you? [They hug.]
The Mutants Are Revolting,Zoidberg, Horray! A happy ending for the rich people!
The Mutants Are Revolting,Leela," Mom, Dad, Grandma, this is where I work."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Munda, Oh! Was there a fire?
The Mutants Are Revolting,Amy," So, Bender, how was the party?"
The Mutants Are Revolting,Bender, Only the greatest party ever! I don't need to have another party in my whole life. I am partied out!
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry, Dang! Sorry we missed it!
The Mutants Are Revolting,Bender," We could have another one, if it would make you guys feel better."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Fry," Really? No, that's not necessary."
The Mutants Are Revolting,Bender," Hit it, Bender! [He shoves a stereo into Fry's arms and turns it on. Bend It starts playing.]"
The Mutants Are Revolting,,
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,,
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Transition Announcer," It's ""The Futurama Holiday Spectacular""! Brought to you by..."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Transition Announcer, Gunderson's Unshelled Nuts!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Amy," Ah, the Xmas season. Who wants a delicious unshelled nut?"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," Ooh, I'll have one!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Amy," Mmm... ""It's NUTSO Good!"""
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Fry, Oh.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Leela," What's wrong, Fry? Are you regretting another wasted year?"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Fry, I don't know. Somethin' about Xmas just doesn't feel like Christmas.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth, Santa's coming! Initiate defenses!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Robot Santa," God rest ye, merry gentlemen... in peace! [fires his missile]"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Fry, Can someone please explain how you celebrate this crazy holiday? Preferably in song?
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Robot Santa, [singing] It's the violentest season of the year.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Elf, [singing] Old Kringle-bot has come to spread some mugs of Xmas fear.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Robot Santa, [singing] Sugar-plummy visions will be dancing in your head
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,When I cane you from the comfort of my sled.,
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Leela," [singing] On Xmas Eve, we don our gay apparel,"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,"Kevlar vests, asbestos stockings and a barrel.",
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth," [singing] And if Grandma's Xmas fruitcake finally reaches critical mass,"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,It can be regifted straight to Santa's ass.,
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Robot Santa," [singing] But the ornamental armaments are merely superficial,"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,The tinsel and the trappings are just icing on the missile.,
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,The one thing that you need to make your Xmas day splendiferous,
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Is a pine tree; a pine tree that's coniferous.,
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Planet Express crew (except Amy), [singing] We have to have a pine tree as coniferous.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Robot Santa, You're welcome.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Fry," You know, Santa may have killed Scruffy, but he makes a good point. What we need is an old-fashioned pine tree."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth," Cram it, Virginia! Pine trees have been extinct for over eight hundred years."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Leela," Professor, maybe there's some way to bring the pine trees back to life, like we did with the barking snakes."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth," Pine trees aren't barking snakes. They won't just turn up in a salad at Olive Garden. But there is one hope, and, as usual, it's Norwegian!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth," Behold! The Svalbard Global Seed Vault! Since 2008, the vault has preserved seeds of every known plant species in case of extinction."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Hermes, And I brought a few seeds of my own.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Norwegian seed guard," Halt! Wh-what's your business poky-pokin' about da seed vault, eh, guardian of mankind's precious botanical heritage dere?"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth, We just wanna come in and rummage about a bit.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Norwegian seed guard, Oh. So... okay. [unlocks the vault]
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," Yo, ABBA, what's that next door?"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,"[Zoom out to reveal another vault with the sign ""Germ Warfare Repository"" with a window that opens and shuts with the wind]",
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,<poem>Norwegian seed guard," Oh, dat's da germ warfare repository."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Leela, It's so close! Is there any chance of cross-contamination?
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Norwegian seed guard, No.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Norwegian seed guard," Now, your pine trees were all chopped down to make imirgincee toilet paper durin' th' fifty-year squirts. Lucky da seeds have bin preserved here in da vault der."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Amy," What's that splork on them? [the camera cuts to a closeup of a tray full of germs] It's not germs, is it?"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Norwegian seed guard, No.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Fry, Now that's a tree worth chopping down.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Tinny Tim, Indeed. 'Tis a loverly tree. 'Twould truly be my finest Xmas eve-
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Nixon, Araroo!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Nixon, That's what my poll numbers need  Happy voters enjoying some holiday cheer.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Cheney," As your Vice President, I order you to steal that tree."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Nixon," My fellow Earthicans, welcome to the Annual White House Xmas Tree Lighting, brought to you by Gunderson's Nuts!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Amy," Oh, no! Could the seed have been contaminated by a virus from the germ vault?"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Norwegian seed guard," Oh, yeh, I suppose."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Leela," Wait, this could be a good thing. That weaponized virus made the sickly little tree grow big and strong."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Leela," Wait, this could be a good thing. Reforestation has begun."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," Aw, jeez with this, hey?(?)"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Leela," Arguably, this could be a good thing. The planet has returned to its primeval state."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Fry, Earth is just the way it was before the white man came!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth," Good news! All these pine trees are fighting global warming by producing oxygen. Happy now, Gore?"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Gore," Yeah, but I'd be happier if I had a set of lungs."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth, Wait a second! Oxygen levels are rising too rapidly! 10%... 20% ...60%!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Gore, As long as it doesn't hit 70!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth, 80%!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," Y'know, I don't recall having done anything for a while. But I still feel like I deserve a smoke. [takes out a cigar and lights it, which causes Gore, Leela and Farnsworth to turn around and gasp, when Bender sees sparks in the air] Hey, cool, the air's on fire."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Robot Santa," Ho ho ho! Everyone's dead! [cheerfully, to the viewing audience] Stay tuned for another tale of holiday hilarity!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Transition Announcer," Now, back to..."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Transition Announcer, ...the Gunderson's Nuts Holiday Spectacular featuring Futurama!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth," Okay, crew. Xmas break is over. It's time to destroy these gifts we forgot to deliver."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," Woah, woah, woah! How come we get off for every dumb human holiday but not for robot holidays?"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Leela," Oh, Lord, not Robanukah."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," I'm talkin' about Robanukah, the holiest six and a half weeks in the robot calendar!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Amy, Pfft! That's just a fake holiday you make up every year to get out of work.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Fry," Yeah, if it's real, how come there's no song that explains how you celebrate it?"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender, Because there is! Hit it!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth, Hit what?
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender, I've placed instruments under your seats. Play 'em or I'll break 'em over your heads!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," [singing] Robanukah may sound as if it's Jewish,"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,But its ancient sounding customs are exceptionally newish.,
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,"So take a hearty swallow from your robo-kiddish cup,",
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Which will give me time to quickly make them up.,
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Hermes, [singing] Do you spin a dreidel made from clay?
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender, [singing] Mine is called a droidel and it's rigged to make you pay.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Amy, [singing] Do you eat these dummy tin-wrapped chocolate coins?
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," Better! [singing] We got fembots with illegal five-speed groins! [spoken] Shalom, Ruth and Esther!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Ruth, Why with the music so loud?
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Esther, Would it kill him to turn up the heat a little in here?
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender, [singing] But by far the most important thing is oil.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Leela, [singing] To keep the lamp light burning or to help the latkes broil?
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," [singing] No, we pour the holy lubricant out from the sacred vessel"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Into this blessed pit so they can wrestle.,
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Planet Express crew, [singing] The extra made-up touch that makes Robanukah so special
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Is the oil in which the nasty fembots wrestle.,
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," We shall now begin the traditional oil wrestling. Will the referee bring out the ceremonial crudes of petroleum oil? [a monkey wearing a referee's outfit and carrying an oil can comes in] Thank you, Abraham. [Bender takes the can and is about to squirt the oil but Ruth stops him]"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Ruth," Not in the hair, please. I just had it did."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," Aw, no! These broads are s'posed to wrestle for six and a half weeks! But there's only enough petroleum oil for four and a half weeks!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Esther," We're still gettin' paid, right?"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender, I told you it's an audition!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Leela," Bender, four and a half weeks of oil wrestling sounds like plenty."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender, This isn't a lousy reform Robanukah! We need more petroleum oil!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Hoschel," I got me some whale oil, some squirrel oil—"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender, Not kosher! It has to be petroleum oil! Do you not give a damn about the hallowed traditions of Robanukah?!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Hoschel," I reckon I do not. Anyways, Earth done run out of petroleum oil."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Gore, I tried to warn you. [to Hoschel] One unit of free limitless solar power please.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Hoschel, That'll be... I dunno... ten bucks?
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Gore," Um, can you make change for a Nobel Prize?"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," Aw, man! Can't we just make more petroleum oil?"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth," I'm afraid not, son. [turns on the hologram projector which shows a grid sphere] Petroleum only forms when organic matter is subjected to intense pressure for hundreds of millions of years."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Fry, I can't wait that long! I've got ADD!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender, This is so unfair!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Ruth," I don't wrestle dry, Bender. I went to Vassar."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," Professor, I want you to look these poor floozies in the eye and tell them their oil wrestling days are over."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth," [sighs] I suppose there could be a minute quantity of petroleum left. But it would be insanely deep within the Earth, at pressures so dangerously high that—"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender, Let's go already!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Leela, Setting Bachman turners to overdrive.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Hermes, We're getting pretty deep. [gasps] Look! Mole coffins!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Amy [Off Screen]," Oh, no! We tunneled into a tunnel!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Zoidberg," What's that loud, boring sound you'll hear when I stop talking? [A loud, boring sound is heard. Leela adjusts the mirror so that she can see an huge, albino (red-eyed, white) worm-looking thing.]"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth, [Gasps] It's an albino humping worm!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Fry, Why do they call it that? [The ship rocks back and forth; parts of the worm are seen outside the window.]
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth, Because it doesn't have any pigment.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth," What's our depth, Captain?"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Leela, Forty kilometers. Fifty!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender, There must be petroleum oil down here somewhere. Go deeper! Deeper!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth," No, Bender! The ship can't withstand this much pressure! Sometimes it falls apart just sitting in the hangar!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," Professor, I've never asked for anything before, but seeing those fembots glistening with oil means more to me than life itself."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth," [Sighs] Oh, call me an old fool, but I believe the Lord is speaking through you. [To the rest of the crew] Brace yourselves, everyone!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,[Everyone braces themselves. The ship goes deeper.],
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Leela, One hundred kilometers! Two hundred!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Amy," I hate to complain about the heat, but the air conditioner is on fire!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Hermes," [Is about to bite into a soylent ice-cream snack, but it melts.] My ice cream manwich!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Leela," What the hell are we doing? We're all gonna die so this ""junkyard Golem"" can celebrate Robanukah."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," You vile racist! Haven't my people suffered enough? Now keep drilling for that petroleum oil, you selfish cowards! Although, then again, I guess any kind of oil would be just as-"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Everybody else," Aah! [The side of the ship that everybody except for Bender is on caves in, killing everyone.]"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender, [Looks away] Not my fault.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," I am so great! Bender is great! Bender, Bender, Bender-- [Takes out the watch from ""The Prisoner of Benda"".] Man, where'd the time go? [Turns around] Hey, you guys wanna— Oh. Right. [gasps] They turned into petroleum oil! I thought they were selfish, yet in the end it turned out it was I who thought they were selfish!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," Doo, doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo-Doo, DOO!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," Hey, ladies, I found some... What the—? [Ruth and Esther are still wrestling in the oil.] There was only enough petroleum for four and a half weeks of oil wrestling. But it lasted 500 million years! It's a miracle!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," Happy Robanukah, everyone! Coming up next, more thoughtful, interfaith hijinx!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Transition Announcer," And now, the unrelated conclusion."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Leela," LaBarbara, Hermes, happy Kwanzaa. We brought a chocolate cake. But now I'm worried that might be offensive in some way."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,LaBarbara, Just sit down.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,[The bell rings again and Bubblegum is at the door.],
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,<poem>Bubblegum," Happy Kwanzaa, brother men and sister men."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Hermes," Well, look at the cat the cat dragged in."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bubblegum, Kwanzaa tradition encourages educational gifts. So I brought Dwight my book on Mathketball. [He shows them a copy.]
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Dwight, Woah! Let me see that. [He throws it into the trash.]
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bubblegum, I'll sign it for you later.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Barbados," Mon, it's a cold one out there."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Hermes, Barbados Slim?
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,LaBarbara," Come in, Barbados. Look at yourself, all throbbing and shirtless for the holiday. I hope you're ready to celebrate."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Barbados," All night long, woman. [He laughs and walks off with LaBarbara.]"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Hermes," I'm glad you all could be here with my family. Kwanzaa traditions are quite ancient, dating back over 1,000 years."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Fry, Woah!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Zoidberg, If only someone could tell us more about these traditions. [He turns to the wall.]
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Kwanzaa-bot," Oh, yeah!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Dwight," Hey, Kool-Aid's here."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,LaBarbara," No, child. That's not a made-up character. It's Kwanzaa-bot."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Kwanzaa-bot," And I'm gonna tell you all how we celebrate Kwanzaa. Zoidberg, lay down a beat."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Zoidberg, How about I just lay down?
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Kwanzaa-bot, The seven basic principles that go to make up Kwanzaa!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,So sit yo' asses down and have some knowledge dropped upons ya!,
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,LaBarbara, Kujichagulia...
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Barbados and Bubblegum, And umoja...
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Hermes, And the rest.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Planet Express crew, Now we get it!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Kwanzaa-bot, Sit back down! There's gonna be a test.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,My favorite's ujamaa.,
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bubblegum, Cooperative economics.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Kwanzaa-bot," Yo, boondocks, I'm talkin' here! Put away the comics!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,"Ku'umba is another one, it stands for creativity.",
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Barbados, Like the ever-changing nature of my sexual proclivities.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Kwanzaa-bot," I think there's one called ""nia,"" but I don't speak Swahili,"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Sumthin' 'bout a pine tree and a oil-wrestlin' dealy?,
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth," That's from Xmas and Robanakuh, you plagiarizing lout!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Kwanzaa-bot," Yeah, I'm kinda losin' interest here. I'd best be rollin' out."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,"But before I go, the most important thing...",
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Dwight," What's that, Black Santa?"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Kwanzaa-bot, You need seven Kwanzaa candles that you light up every night.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,But they best be made of beeswax or y'all might as well be white.,
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Planet Express crew, They must be made of beeswax or we might as well be white.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,LaBarbara," Well, we got no beeswax candles, but these scented regular wax candles will do just fine."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Kwanzaa-bot," Girl, those stink sticks are for single women who take baths. If your Kwanzaa candles ain't 100% beeswax, you bring shame on your people."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,LaBarbara," Well, now that won't do. Husband, show a little ku'umba and fetch some beeswax before Kwanzaa ends."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Hermes," Sweet candelabra of La Habra, LaBarbara! Isn't this the last night of Kwanzaa?"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Kwanzaa-bot, Who the hell knows?
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Hermes," Finally, a bee farm that's open late on Kwanzaa. Madam, I need beeswax."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Petunia," You sure you don't need a little honey, handsome? Maybe a taste of sweet nectar straight from the hive?"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Hermes, I just need some beeswax to make Kwanzaa candles.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Petunia," Well, that's too darn bad. There ain't no beeswax in the whole world."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Amy," Oh, no! This could be the year without a Kwanzaa, like every year before 1966."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Petunia," The bees are acting all crazy  like they've been drinking Tang and cough syrup, or as I call it, my Friday night. [She gives a hacking laugh.]"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth, [Observing a bee under a magnifying glass.] My God! It's Colony Collapse Syndrome. The bees are swarming with parasites. They're all dying.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Petunia," Yeah, but what a way to go. ""Die young and leave a pretty corpse,"" that's what I say."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender, You should say someth'n' else.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Fry," Wait. I know where we can get beeswax. From those giant space bees that nearly killed us, and we swore we'd never go back there."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth, Let's go back there!
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth," To communicate with the bees, we'll need to use these trans-bumbalators. Bender, say something in bee talk."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Leela," I'm sorry, Bender. What do you want me to put on the glass? [Bender buzzes some more.] Okay, if we survive."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Amy, Something's wrong. It's way too quiet.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Fry, Like the deadly Prius.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth," Ah, here they come."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Leela," They're in attack formation. They're going to kill us! [The bees fly in circles and crash, exploding when they hit something.] That was weird. It's like the Jägermeister air show all over again."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Hermes," According to Google Hive, we're at the exact center of the honeycomb. Oh! And there's a Jamba Juice point 2 miles that way."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bender," Does that thing tell you where the Queen Bee is? The big, fat, ugly, compound-eyed, hairy-thoraxed..."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Queen," [She slaps Bender.] Don't be applying your Eurocentric standards of beauty to me, fool. [Another bee explodes.]"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Hermes, What's with the kamikaz-bees?
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Queen," Man, my hive's been going buck-wild since these blood-ganking butt crabs moved in."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Zoidberg," Been there, done that."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth," They're all infected, just like the bees on Earth."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Queen," Brother-sucking parasites gone and disrupted our hivemind. Now, instead of working in harmony, my bees just talk smack to each other."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bee #1, Are you all black with yellow stripes or yellow with black stripes?
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bee #2," Yellow with black stripes, man."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bee #1, [He pulls out a rifle.] Why don't you just move along?
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bee #3," Let me ask you something, you sting my wife?"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bee #4, What kind of buzzing question is that? Where do you get the wings big enough to ask me that? [They start fighting.]
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Leela," [She scrapes beeswax into a jar.] Okay, gang. We have plenty of beeswax. Let's get back to the ship."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Hermes," No, we're not going anywhere. I can't abide all this bee-on-bee conflict. It's time to African-Americanize these honeybees. Listen up, bees. It's Kwanzaa, a time of Umoja."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Amy, It means unity.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Hermes, You have to learn to work together again.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Queen, The crazy tablecloth-man is right. It's time to set aside our differences.
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bee #1," [He puts down his gun.] Black stripe, yellow stripe. At the end o' day, we're just a couple of darn talking space bees."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Bee #3," Hey, forget about it. Come here and give me a sting. [The parasites start falling off.]"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Farnsworth," Look, the spirit of Kwanzaa is killing the parasites."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Fry," Yuck, but yay!"
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Queen," Thank you, my human brother. Your message of unity has touched our souls. We are once again of a single hive-mind."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Kwanzaa-bot," Oh, yeah."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Zoidberg," Hurray! Kwanzaa-bot's here to save— [A squishing noise is heard.] Aw, they killed him."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Hermes," Joyous Kwanzaa, everybody."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,Gore," Don't worry, the Futurama crew will be back next year, with all-new episodes featuring Bender, Leela and me, Al Gore, as Captain Lance Starman. [Amy walks up wearing a Gunderson's Nuts costume.] And from all of us here at Gunderson's Nuts, happy holidays."
The Futurama Holiday Spectacular,,
The Silence of the Clamps,,
The Silence of the Clamps,Farnsworth," Who likes good news? [All but Professor Farnsworth raise their hands.] Everyone. [The camera zooms in on Professor Farnsworth, revealing that the package that he is holding is labelled RUSH.] Then good news, everyone! Our next delivery isn't to some dangerous, outer-space planet. It's to Earth!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry," Earth is dangerous. I fell off my chair there once. [Fry leans back in his chair and falls off it.] Ow! Quit it, Earth."
The Silence of the Clamps,Leela, We won't even have to leave New New York! The package is going to Long Long Island.
The Silence of the Clamps,Farnsworth," Yes, to the lavish Mafia-style villa of the Donbot."
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," The Donbot?! [Professor Farnsworth turns to Bender.] The vicious Robot gangster?! [Bender removes the package from Professor Farnsworth's hands.] I'd better use my special Robot vision to see what's inside. [Bender zooms in with his eyes towards the package, perforating it, and then removes them, revealing them to be holding a pair of clamps.] It looks like a pair of clamps!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps, When are those new clamps gonna get here? [Clamps looks at the clamp and it clamps again.] These are all rusted-out with snitch juice!
The Silence of the Clamps,Donbot," Patience, Clamps. [Clamps looks at the Donbot.] It is my eldest daughter's wedding day. [Joey Mousepad looks at the Donbot.] You don't want the Space Pope to see a clampin' now, do ya?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps," Aw, jeez. I forgot my Pope manners."
The Silence of the Clamps,Space Pope," Dearly beloved, [quickly] it is with great speed that I now pronounce you husband and wife."
The Silence of the Clamps,Donbot, What the—
The Silence of the Clamps,Joey Mousepad, May I help you with some assistance?
The Silence of the Clamps,Leela, Delivery for... [Leela looks at the envelope on the package.] Francis X. Clampazzo?
The Silence of the Clamps,Joey Mousepad, We don't got nobody here by that alias.
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps," [off camera] Hey! Hey! That's me. [Joey Mousepad and Leela look at Clamps, who is still off camera.] Are those my new clamps?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Joey Mousepad, Your name's Francis?
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," Guys, look. It's Calculon. And the Robot Devil! [The Robot Devil and Calculon are drinking by a bar.] And an open bar! [The Robot Devil and Calculon make a toast.] What's not to sneak into?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Leela," Bender, you can't crash a mob wedding."
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," You forget, Leela, I'm Bender, owner of disguise."
The Silence of the Clamps,Space Pope," And now, ladies and gentlemen, my good friend... Calculon!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Calculon," Hey, this one's for the new couple. [Calculon points at the Donbot's eldest daughter and her husband.] It's your day. It's all about you. [singing] Who's that singing at your wedding? It's Calculon! [Both Human and Robot women try to reach Calculon.] Calculon! [singing, extendedly] Calculon!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," Ay! Oh! Piscopo! [Bender takes a beer bottle from a waiter and points at Mayor Poopenmeyer, who is with the Queen of Yonkers.] This guy! [Bender stops walking, drinks from his bottle, sees the Donbot's eldest daughter, and gasps.] Bada-boing! [Bender's antenna slicks straight. Bender walks over the Donbot's eldest daughter. The Donbot's eldest daughter is dancing with her husband.] Hey, sexy. I'm Bender. What brings you to this tacky soirée?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Donbot's eldest daughter, I'm the bride!
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," Oops. [Bender slinks away and sees Fanny.] How 'bout you, baby? Wanna do it?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Fanny," Bender, it's me, Fanny!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender, You who?
The Silence of the Clamps,Fanny, The Donbot's wife? We had an affair?
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," An affair, huh? Sounds like me. [Bender shrugs.] [to himself] Jeez, I'd better be a little more careful. I don't wanna hit on anybody I already had sex with."
The Silence of the Clamps,Fanny," [to the fembot] Hiya, Bella!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Bella," Hi, Mom!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender, What about you? You're my third choice.
The Silence of the Clamps,Bella," Oh, Bender! This is all happening too slowly. Let's get married!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," Quiet! I'm makin' out with a floozy! [Bender resumes making love, but hears a noise and stops suddenly.] Hold your clapper. Someone's comin'!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Calculon," Donbot, please. I'll pay you back as soon as you lend me some more money."
The Silence of the Clamps,Donbot," Sorry, Calculon. It gives me no joy to do this... Because Clamps will be doin' it. [The Donbot opens the package and pulls out a pair of clamps.] Clamps, here are your new clamps."
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps, Clamps!
The Silence of the Clamps,Calculon," No. No! [Clamps clamps with his left clamp. Calculon looks to his right.] Line? [Clamps clamps with his left clamp again. Bender is still peering from the door in shock as Clamps does his clamping silhouetted.] [off camera, extendedly, screaming] No!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Bella," Yeah, Daddy hates welchers. The only thing he hates worse is witnesses... [Bender looks horrified.] [musical sting] And guys who mess around with his daughters..."
The Silence of the Clamps,Bella, [continued] And attempt to duplicate his meatball recipe.
The Silence of the Clamps,Leela," How was the wedding, Bender?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender, Says who?! [shouting] I didn't witness anything!
The Silence of the Clamps,Morbo," [off camera] In entertainment news, two-time Oscar-pool winner Calculon was brutally clamped yesterday by an unknown assailant."
The Silence of the Clamps,Amy, Poor Calculon.
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," [shouting] Alright, Amy, you win! [Bender turns to the table.] The mob did it. I saw the whole thing while also having hot sex with the Donbot's daughter. [Bender begins crying, covering his eyes, and lays on the couch.] I'm scared and great at sex!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Leela," Bender, you need to go to the police and tell them a tastefully edited version of what you just said."
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," What, and have the Mafia come after me too?! [Bender points at Leela.] No way! [Bender points up.] This secret goes to my grave!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Male voice, [off camera] The Bureau is offering anyone with information about this gangland-style clamping a fifty-dollar reward.
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," [off camera] Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! And— And then Calculon said, ""No. No!"""
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," [continued, extendedly] ""No!"" [in a normal tone] And, then, I ate some excellent meatballs. [Bender rubs his belly.] Can I have my fifty bucks now?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Robot Stack, I enjoyed your story. [Robot Stack presses a button on the voice recorder.] Especially the tasteful love scene. [Robot Stack stands up.] But it's not enough to convict the Donbot. You'll have to testify... In open court.
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender, No. No! Can I have another fifty dollars?
The Silence of the Clamps,Robot Stack, No.
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender, No?
The Silence of the Clamps,Robot Stack, No!
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender, [extendedly] No!
The Silence of the Clamps,Bailiff, All rise for the honourable Judge 723.
The Silence of the Clamps,Judge 723, Be seated. Organised crime is a plague on our society and I will not tolerate any form of intimidation during—
The Silence of the Clamps,Bailiff, All rise for the honourable Judge 724.
The Silence of the Clamps,Judge 724," Good day. I'd like to say I'm prepared to tolerate several, if not all, forms of intimidation during this trial. Prosecutor?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour, the prosecution pecks for a mistrial on the grounds of jury tamperin'!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Judge 724, Donbot?
The Silence of the Clamps,Donbot, Motion denied.
The Silence of the Clamps,Judge 724," Prosecutor, call your first witness."
The Silence of the Clamps,Hyper-Chicken," The people call our star witness Mr. X, whose appearance will be altered because he's in grave danger."
The Silence of the Clamps,Bella," [shouting] Bender, I've been looking for you! Which cake do you like better for our wedding?!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Donbot, Bender?
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender, [quickly] Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! [The bailiff turns the mirror around and the image of Bender's face is diminished. Bender sighs.] That was close.
The Silence of the Clamps,Yellow and red manbot," Isn't it true, Mr. X, that you were slandering this innocent Mafioso to distract from your own felonious past? [The yellow and red manbot walks up to Bender and points at him with his right hand.] Including the crime you made up yourself called burglarcenarsony?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," That's a wholly-owned trademark of Rodríguez Crime Concepts Inc.! Besides, I'm not on trial here!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Judge 724, That's true. [Judge 724 turns to Bender.] You're on trial in courtroom three.
The Silence of the Clamps,Judge 802, You are charged with two counts of burglarcenarsony. How do you plead?
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender, Not inno-guilty-cent!
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," [off camera] And then the Donbot said, ""Sorry, Calculon."""
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," And then Calculon said, [extendedly] ""No!"""
The Silence of the Clamps,Donbot, I think we've heard enough.
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," Wait, I'm not finished. Oh! [Bender crosses his arms.] Now I'm finished."
The Silence of the Clamps,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour, the prosecution roosts."
The Silence of the Clamps,Judge 724, Have you reached a verdict?
The Silence of the Clamps,Hedonism Bot," Indeed. After a steamy twelve-way deliberation, we find the accused guilty as—"
The Silence of the Clamps,Calculon, [off camera] Wait! [Hedonism Bot is surprised. Calculon enters the courtroom wearing plaster casts and crutches and is followed by Joey Mousepad.] The Donbot is innocent!
The Silence of the Clamps,Judge 724," Calculon, who is that escorting you?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Hedonism Bot, Yes. Who?
The Silence of the Clamps,Calculon," [hesitatingly] My personal trainer. [Calculon and Joey Mousepad begin walking.] And he's trained me to say that my wounds were self-inflicted. [Calculon and Joey Mousepad stop walking.] For, you see, [in an Italian accent] I'm a big Hollywood idiot dumb guy what does that sorta thing."
The Silence of the Clamps,Joey Mousepad, Perfect.
The Silence of the Clamps,Hedonism Bot, We find the Donbot...
The Silence of the Clamps,Calculon, Dramatic pause...
The Silence of the Clamps,Hedonism Bot," [happy, screaming] Not guilty!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Amy, What?
The Silence of the Clamps,Donbot," Honey, if you're marryin' Bender, ya might wanna get a black dress for the wedding."
The Silence of the Clamps,Bella, That's gonna look hot!
The Silence of the Clamps,Robot Stack," Don't be scared, Bender. We're putting you in the witness relocation programme. [Bender uncovers his eyes.] You'll be given a new identity, a new place to live, and this iPod. [Robot Stack grabs an iPod from his right pocket and hands it to Bender.] I don't want it anymore."
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender, So I gotta hide forever?!
The Silence of the Clamps,Robot Stack, No. Just until the Robot Mafia finds and kills you. [Fry looks shocked. Robot Stack looks at him.] They're pretty good at that.
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," Goodbye, Professor. [Bender and Professor Farnsworth shake hands.] Before I leave, I just want you to know I've never done any work whatsoever. [Bender walks up to Zoidberg.] Zoidberg, I know it seems like I can't stand you. [Bender walks up to Leela and holds her hands.] Leela, you'll have to watch out for Fry now."
The Silence of the Clamps,Leela," Oh, Lord."
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry," I wish I could go with you, pal."
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender, Me too. I'll need a butler.
The Silence of the Clamps,Robot Stack," Bender, we have to go."
The Silence of the Clamps,Farnsworth, [sad] There'll never be another like him. [Professor Farnsworth looks down and the others look at him.] [happy] Let's hire someone better!
The Silence of the Clamps,Donbot, Clamps. [Clamps continues staring at the advertisement and says nothing. Joey Mousepad turns to him.] Clamps!
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps, [confused] Huh?
The Silence of the Clamps,Donbot," Listen to my boss words. I would like you to apply for Bender's old job and cosy up to this Fry, his best friend."
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps," Yeah. And I'll introduce 'im to my best friend. [Clamps lifts up his right clamp.] [screaming] Clamp number one! [Clamps looks at his left clamp.] [in a normal tone] Sorry, toots."
The Silence of the Clamps,Donbot," No, Clamps. No clamps. Sooner or later, Bender will contact Fry... As relocated squealers always do."
The Silence of the Clamps,Joey Mousepad, Then with the clamps... Francis.
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps, Francis? Francis?! [screaming] I'll clamp you with the Francis!
The Silence of the Clamps,Joey Mousepad, Ay! Oh! Take it ease.
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps," Hey there, Slick. I'm 'ere about the job."
The Silence of the Clamps,Hermes," Take a seat. [Hermes points to his right, where iZac, Helper, the spotty teen Robot, and three other Robots are sitting. A Robot with no limbs is standing on the floor to his left.] We'll begin the interview shortly."
The Silence of the Clamps,Hermes, We'll start with Andrew.
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps," Yeah, they all kinda broke. So... When do I start?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Hermes," Everyone, this is Francis."
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry," Hey, Francis."
The Silence of the Clamps,Farnsworth," Hello, Francis."
The Silence of the Clamps,Leela, Hello.
The Silence of the Clamps,Amy, Cute name.
The Silence of the Clamps,Hermes, Look what he can do.
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps," Yeah, I do it all. Clampin', crimpin', occasional snippin'."
The Silence of the Clamps,Farnsworth," Snipping? [Professor Farnsworth laughs and turns to Zoidberg.] Looks like you may be out of a job, Zoidberg."
The Silence of the Clamps,Zoidberg," That's all good fun. But, of course, a clamp is no substitute for the precision of a genuine—"
The Silence of the Clamps,Amy," Francis, would you do the honours?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Zoidberg," [to Clamps, screaming] Stay off my turf!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps, Eesh. [Fry walks up to Clamps.] That guy can bite my shiny metal clamps.
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry, [touched] You remind me of my old friend Bender.
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps," Oh, yeah? Where does he safely live?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry," I dunno. Hey, you wanna come to my house and play?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps, Yeah. Sounds like freakin' fun.
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps, Four stinkin' years of clampin' school for this?
The Silence of the Clamps,Zoidberg," [off camera] Greetings, Francis. [Zoidberg walks up to Clamps. Clamps looks at him.] Sorry if I was a little hostile before, but snipping is the only reason I'm even tolerated around here. Not like you, with those magnificent squeezers!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps," Squeezers? Squeezers?! [Clamps lifts up his right clamp.] They're clamps, you [beep sound]! [Clamps grabs Zoidberg by the neck and pushes him up against the lockers.] And if I wanna [beep sound]-in' snip with these clamps, I will snip with these [beep sound]-ing clamps! [Zoidberg begins suffocating.] Why do you think they call me— [Professor Farnsworth enters.] Francis?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Farnsworth," Eh, Francis, I have good news. It's time for your first delivery... [Professor Farnsworth holds up one finger.] To the Moon!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps, Fan-[beep sound]-in'-tastic!
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry," Here's the two-hundred feet of rope you ordered, Sheriff Burley."
The Silence of the Clamps,Sheriff Burley," Hot diggety! You fellas wanna stick around for the hangin' tomorrow? It's gonna be a doozy. [Sheriff Burley points to a muttering eight-headed Alien who is wearing eight moustaches and eight cowboy hats and is holding a mug.] I sure do love hangin' people. [Sheriff Burley signs Leela's pad and pants.] Well, best start cuttin' the nooses."
The Silence of the Clamps,Leela, Oh! You know who could help with that?! [Leela looks at the others. Zoidberg walks up to Leela and Sheriff Burley and claws three times.] Francis!
The Silence of the Clamps,Leela," Nice job, Francis! I liked how you didn't get drunk and steal anyone's organs. Like our old Robot—"
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry," Bender?! [Bender is wearing a hat and overall and driving a hovercarriage that is being pulled by the Crushinator. He looks at the crew. Fry runs towards Bender.] Bender! It's me, Fry!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Donbot," [in the hologram] I knew Bender would turn up purely by coincidence. Take care of 'im, but do it quietly."
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps, Don't worry. We're in space. Where no one can hear you clamp!
The Silence of the Clamps,Hermes, What do you know? The Feds gave Bender a new identity as a Moon farmer.
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry," Well, he must be afraid to break character in case there's any Robot Mafia scuzzballs around."
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps, Huh?
The Silence of the Clamps,Amy, Come on! Let's go check on 'im!
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps, [sad] I checked on a guy once. [angry] I checked 'im into tiny pieces!
The Silence of the Clamps,Hydroponic farmer," Bender?! Nope, don't recollect nobody by that name. But let me ask my son-in-law. [The hydroponic farmer turns to his left.] [shouting] Billy!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," Yes, Moon pa?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Hydroponic farmer," These nice, big-city hillbillies are lookin' for someone named Bender. You know 'im?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," No, he ain't any of the eight people I ever met."
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry," Bender, it's us, your friends. You can drop the hillbilling moron act."
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," Sorry, mister, but I'm no Bender. I'm just a simple farmer. Name's Billy West!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry," Billy West. What a stupid, phony, made-up name!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Hydroponic farmer, You city folk are probably hungry from premarital sex and flag burnin'. Y'all wanna stay for supper?
The Silence of the Clamps,Amy," Well... [Amy shrugs.] My boyfriend and I were gonna have sex on a burning flag, but... [Amy shrugs again.] I could have a bite."
The Silence of the Clamps,Billy West," May I present my beautiful Robot wife, the Crushinator. She's servin' up the dinner and the charm."
The Silence of the Clamps,Crushinator," Mashed chicken, Mr. Fry?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry, Sure!
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps," So, uh... Billy... Where were you born?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Billy West, Right here in Moon country!
The Silence of the Clamps,Farnsworth, And how long have you been a farmer?
The Silence of the Clamps,Billy West, Reckon I was born a farmer. Folks say my momma was a hoe.
The Silence of the Clamps,Leela," Oh, dear! I seem to have warped my fork! [to Billy West] Could you bend it back for me? Billy?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Billy West," Bend it? [Billy West tries to lift the fork, but does not succeed.] I can't even lift it. Which is weird... Seein' as how my daddy was a forklift."
The Silence of the Clamps,Leela," [to Fry, whispering] Wow! Bender is really committed to his new Jethrovian identity!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Billy West," If y'all are all finished, I'll drive y'all back to town in the old clunker."
The Silence of the Clamps,Billy West, So... Y'all flew here in a spacey-ship?
The Silence of the Clamps,Hermes, Stop talking like that! You live on the Moon!
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry," [sad] If that is Bender, I guess he's just happier in his new life."
The Silence of the Clamps,Farnsworth," I refuse to believe anyone is happy! Mr. West, would you mind if I examined your brain?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Billy West," Examine? Heck. If you can find it, you can keep it."
The Silence of the Clamps,Farnsworth," Gadzooks! [Professor Farnsworth enlightens Billy West's head.] Bender's hard drive no longer contains any of his old memories. When the Feds bumpkinised him, they completely wiped out his old identity!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Billy West," Well, I don't know about that. But who am I to argue with a man from the sky! [Billy West stands up.] So long, space heroes!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry, [sad] You sure you don't wanna kill all Humans?
The Silence of the Clamps,Billy West, Pfff! I love all Humans!
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry, He really is gone.
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry," [sad] I guess I'm happy for 'im. And, honestly, Francis is a way better friend than Bender ever was. [Also present are Amy and Professor Farnsworth, standing up, and Hermes, sitting down.] Hey, where is Francis?"
The Silence of the Clamps,Billy West," One sasparoil, Sheriff! I'm thirsty!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Sheriff Burley, Make it two. I'm greedy.
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps, You got the rest fooled. [Clamps turns to Billy West and points at himself with his right clamp.] But not me. [Clamps walks up to Billy West.] Now let's take this outside so's no one else gets clamped.
The Silence of the Clamps,Billy West," You're the boss, stranger!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps," I'm gonna clamp your body parts off one by one. But, then, I'm gonna clamp your wounds shut so ya stay alive... While I clamp ya some more. Say your prayers, stoolie."
The Silence of the Clamps,Billy West, Okay! [Billy West folds his hands.] God bless grandma and grandpa—
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps," They're next! Right now, I'm gonna cut your damn head off!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Zoidberg, [off camera] Drop the Robut. [Clamps looks to his right. Zoidberg claws five times.] I thought I told you. I do the cutting around here.
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps," Scuttle on home. [Clamps points at Zoidberg with his left clamp.] This ain't none of your business, Slick."
The Silence of the Clamps,Zoidberg, My name isn't Slick. It's Zoidberg. [Zoidberg looks up.] [screaming] John [beep sound]-ing Zoidberg!
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry," Stop, Zoidberg! [Leela looks at Fry with interest.] You'll hurt Francis!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps," Oh, yeah? Take this! That that!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Zoidberg," [quickly, repeatedly] Oy!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps," Why, you lousy— [Zoidberg throws Clamps through a window with HARDWARE painted on it, partially destroying it. Clamps emerges with vises on his body, shakes them off, screams, and jumps at Zoidberg, making him fall on a water tank. Zoidberg emerges with lobsters on his body, shakes them off, screams, and attacks Clamps.] I'm gonna clamp ya!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Zoidberg, [screaming] Oy! [Zoidberg's head is almost broken.] Ow. Ow. Ow.
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps, Looks like an all-you-can-kill lobster fest.
The Silence of the Clamps,Zoidberg, That offer was for a limited time only.
The Silence of the Clamps,Clamps," [screaming, extendedly] My clamps!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry," Why, Zoidberg?! Why?!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Zoidberg, Because our friend Francis here is in reality... A bad murderer.
The Silence of the Clamps,Billy West, Yup. He was fixin' to kill me. [Billy West points at Zoidberg.] This here crawdad done saved my life!
The Silence of the Clamps,Bella," Bender, you two-timing jerk! [Bella points at herself with her left hand.] I put off my singing career for you! And, if I can't have you, [screaming] no one can!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Billy West," Aw, shucks."
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry, Bender!
The Silence of the Clamps,Leela, No!
The Silence of the Clamps,Hermes, What?
The Silence of the Clamps,Donbot," Bender was a helluva squealer. [The Donbot takes his hat off.] Maybe the best there ever was. We'll send his widow some meatballs. Clamps, Bella, get in the way-back."
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry, To my friend Bender. A wise man once said he was a helluva squealer. [sad] Maybe the best there ever was.
The Silence of the Clamps,All, To Bender!
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender, [in an Italian accent] You pizzas gonna be another minute. [Bender walks up to the table wearing a moustache and an apron and holding a tray with a bigger beer mug on it.] We are still waitin' for it to be delivered.
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry, Bender?!
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender, [in an Italian accent] I'm no Bender. You got me mixed up with another Robot.
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry, [sad] You're probably right. [Fry shrugs.] I don't really remember what he looks like.
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," Guys! Guys! It's me, Bender!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Fry," [happy, screaming] He's alive!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Leela," [happy, screaming] So that Moon hillbilly who got murdered was just an innocent husband and father!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Farnsworth," Bender, old bot, the Mafia thinks you're dead! You can come back to work with us!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," I'm back, baby!"
The Silence of the Clamps,Brown-haired man, Pizza's here.
The Silence of the Clamps,Bender," Woo! [Bender stands up, opens the pizza box, and grabs a cutter from a pocket in his apron.] I'll just cut that."
The Silence of the Clamps,Zoidberg, You do and I'll [beep sound]-ing gut you like a fish!
The Silence of the Clamps,,
Möbius Dick,,
Möbius Dick,Leela, Where's the Professor?
Möbius Dick,Bender," Eh, probably dead. Already dissolving in a bathtub if we're lucky."
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth, I was out on the widow's walk keeping a hopeless vigil for the return of my first delivery crew. [Professor Farnsworth walks up to the table.] It's been fifty years since they disappeared.
Möbius Dick,Fry," Huh. I knew you had other crews, but you never told us you had a first crew."
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth, I remember it like it was interesting.
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth, [voice-over] I had just built my new shipping and receiving emporium.
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth, [voice-over] And I scoured the hardware-store parking lot to assemble the finest crew imaginable.
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth," [voice-over] There was Candy, the raunchy by-the-books navigator... [The camera pans over to a Robot from the parking lot.] Lifter, the devastatingly handsome forklift... [The camera pans over to a man from the parking lot. The man blinks three times.] And Captain Lando Tucker, a dedicated young man with no characteristics."
Möbius Dick,Lando Tucker, We'll deliver that package or die trying.
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg, Eh! It's all my favourite patients. And also Captain Tucker. Pow!
Möbius Dick,Candy, Whoa!
Möbius Dick,Lando Tucker," You totally got me, Dr. John. [Lando Tucker crosses his arms.] You're hilarious."
Möbius Dick,Hermes, Zoidberg was popular?!
Möbius Dick,Amy, Zoidberg had hair?!
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth," I never said he had hair! [Professor Farnsworth stands up and puts both his hands on the table.] If you chose to imagine 'im that way, that's your business. [Professor Farnsworth sits down.] Anyway..."
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth, [voice-over] The time came for our first delivery.
Möbius Dick,Young woman," Lando, don't forget about me and Junior."
Möbius Dick,Lando Tucker," I won't, honey. [Lando Tucker puts his right hand on his chest.] Or die trying."
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth," Well, crew, this is it. That cookie bouquet isn't going to deliver itself."
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth, [off camera] Ten...
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth, [continued] Nine and so on. Three... [A scientist turns two dials from OFF to ON.] Two... [A scientist opens a glass case containing a button.] One.
Möbius Dick,Scientist," Go, you big metal bird! Get up there!"
Möbius Dick,Hermes, Incredible! [Hermes turns to his right.] Zoidberg had friends?!
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg, It was a different time.
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth," [voice-over] Everything was going smoothly until right after that part I was just telling you about. [Professor Farnsworth continues walking among the scientists. Another scientist turns to him and lifts up a telephone.] Suddenly, Amanda's aunt called to say her niece hadn't received her cookie bouquet."
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth, [voice-over] I watched the skies for weeks. With only occasional breaks to tender my grief diarrhea.
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth, [voice-over] Just when all hope was lost...
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth," The ship's escape pod! [Professor Farnsworth takes a step back just as an escape pod with PLANET EXPRESS and a Planet Express logo on it crashes into the wall. The escape pod opens. Zoidberg, who has unkempt, white hair, emerges, falls down, and stands up.] What happened up there, Johnny?"
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg," Aw! Don't make me remember! So horrible, it was."
Möbius Dick,Amy, I thought you said he didn't have hair.
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth," Yes, but something he saw on that mission traumatised 'im so severely, he grew hair! [Professor Farnsworth hits the holographic projector on the conference table with both his hands.] Just so it could turn white! Sadly, my brave crew was gone forever."
Möbius Dick,Leela," That poor, incompetent crew. [Leela puts her right hand on both Professor Farnsworth's hands.] What do you think happened, Professor?"
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth, They were lost in the Bermuda Tetrahedron!
Möbius Dick,Leela, That's ridiculous. [Leela turns to her right and crosses her arms.] The Bermuda Tetrahedron is just a myth.
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth," I'm glad you're so brave in the face of the unknown, Leela. [Professor Farnsworth deactivates the holographic projector and sits down.] Because, for your next mission, you'll be flying directly through... [Professor Farnsworth stands up.] The Bermuda Tetrahedron!"
Möbius Dick,Leela, Or we could fly around it.
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth, Of course you could! You'd be stupid not to.
Möbius Dick,Bender," Supposing we're not stupid, what kinda stupid mission is this?!"
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth," You'll be picking up a monument commemorating my lost crew. [Professor Farnsworth folds his hands.] To be unveiled Tuesday at their memorial ceremony. All the grieving families will be there. [Professor Farnsworth unfolds his hands.] Plus, a popsicle cart!"
Möbius Dick,Leela," You can count on us, Professor. We'll get that monument here in time."
Möbius Dick,Bender, Hooray!
Möbius Dick,Amy, Woohoo!
Möbius Dick,Bender, Yeah!
Möbius Dick,Leela, Or die trying.
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg, We're gonna try— What?
Möbius Dick,Green Alien," 'Ere you go. ""In memory of the 1st Planet Express ship and it's crew""."
Möbius Dick,Leela, Hang on. [Leela points at the statue with her left hand.] It's shouldn't have an apostrophe. This means and it is crew. What the hell's wrong with you?!
Möbius Dick,Green Alien," It's a minor error, lady. I mean, we're space Aliens. [The green Alien points at himself with his four hands.] It's a miracle we can even speak English."
Möbius Dick,Leela, The miracle is that I'm not kickin' your ass! [Leela hits the green Alien's chest with her right index finger.] I insist you recarve the entire statue correctly.
Möbius Dick,Green Alien," Okay. Okay. [screaming] Hey, Charlie! Hack off another block of ivory!"
Möbius Dick,Amy," [off camera] Well, the statue's perfect now."
Möbius Dick,Amy, Too bad we won't make it back in time for the memorial service.
Möbius Dick,[Amy shrugs.],
Möbius Dick,<poem>Leela, We'll make it. Or die trying.
Möbius Dick,Fry, Whoa!
Möbius Dick,Leela, We're cutting through the Bermuda Tetrahedron.
Möbius Dick,Bender, Woo! [Bender turns to Leela.] Wait. The Bermuda Tetrahedron?
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg, Aw... I think I'm remembering that thing I forgot.
Möbius Dick,Amy, Uh-oh. The dials are terrified!
Möbius Dick,Leela, Brace yourselves. It's Tickle Me Elmo's fire!
Möbius Dick,Bender, Ow.
Möbius Dick,Leela, There. See? It was no big thing.
Möbius Dick,Hermes, What was that big thing?
Möbius Dick,Fry, [off camera] It's a spaceship graveyard.  [on camera] Why did we have to come 'ere at night?
Möbius Dick,Hermes, Look at all these famous lost ships. [Hermes gasps and points to his right with his left hand.] There's the Garmin. [Hermes gasps and points to his left with his left hand.] And the TomTom.
Möbius Dick,Leela, Over there! It's the original Planet Express ship!
Möbius Dick,Amy, [off camera] What caused all that damage?
Möbius Dick,Amy, Could it've been flavour-blasted?
Möbius Dick,Leela," We'd better investigate. [There is thunder.] Looks like an Ion Storm, though. [Leela turns to her right.] Everyone suit up!"
Möbius Dick,Leela," Whatever happened here, that first crew left in a hurry. [The camera zooms out, revealing a table with three hamburgers, three soda cups, and two chip packages on it.] The table is still set from McDonald's value dinner!"
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg," I remember. I remember! [Zoidberg walks up to the table.] This is what traumatised me. Such a meal to got to waste! [Zoidberg takes his helmet off, throws it away, and eats the food.] And, with that... [Zoidberg burps.] I have closure."
Möbius Dick,Amy," Hey, Zoidberg. You're cockatieling."
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg," Oh, no. [Zoidberg blinks.] Something's happening! [Zoidberg looks around.] What's happening?!"
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg," Oh, right! And there was a giant killer space whale."
Möbius Dick,Bender, Holy crap! [Bender points at the space whale.] It's a giant space fish!
Möbius Dick,Leela," Actually, the space whale isn't a space fish. [The space whale opens its mouth.] It's a space mammal."
Möbius Dick,Bender," Wow, interesting. I'm both impressed and being eaten."
Möbius Dick,Hermes," Spacewalk, people! Spacewalk for your lives!"
Möbius Dick,Fry," Man, look at 'im go! Like a millionaire on a cocktail wiener."
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg, [repeatedly] Woob.
Möbius Dick,Leela, I did it! I outran 'im!
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg," Relax, friends."
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg," Panic, jerks!"
Möbius Dick,Hermes, That's no ordinary space whale! [Hermes turns to his right.] It's a four-dimensional space whale!
Möbius Dick,Amy, Of course! And it only breaches into our 3-D universe to hunt and fill its lungs with vacuum!
Möbius Dick,Leela," Whatever its beef is, our one mission now is to get that monument to Earth."
Möbius Dick,Leela, Correction  Our one mission now is to avenge the loss of that monument.
Möbius Dick,Amy, Shmeesh! He gonked off the engines!
Möbius Dick,Leela," That won't stop me! [The lights go back on. Leela stands up.] Raise the solar sails. I'm goin' after that ""Möbius Dick""."
Möbius Dick,Hermes," You been hittin' the Red Stripe, woman!"
Möbius Dick,Leela," Comport yourself, Mr. Conrad! When we're at space, the Captain's word is law. [Leela points at herself with her left hand.] I could marry you and Bender against your will if I wanted to."
Möbius Dick,Hermes, You wouldn't dare!
Möbius Dick,Bender, I've been married to worse.
Möbius Dick,Fry," Leela, I'm no doctor, but I'm afraid you be exhibiting symptoms of illin'. [Fry removes his hand from Leela's shoulder. Amy, Zoidberg, and Hermes have stood up.] You're risking all our lives for your own personal obsession."
Möbius Dick,Leela," There's nothing personal about this! [Leela points at Fry with her right hand.] That thing screwed up my delivery! This time, [musical sting] it's business!"
Möbius Dick,Leela," Maybe, if I move the compass like this, it will somehow kill the whale."
Möbius Dick,Amy," Leela, we need to talk. You've gone from crazy like a fox to crazy like Fox News!"
Möbius Dick,Leela," Fear not the space behemoth. [Leela turns back to her right.] In my dreams, I've peered beyond its eyes and into the cackling hell within us all."
Möbius Dick,Fry, Okay... [Fry looks down.] That's a good point.
Möbius Dick,Bender," Fry's right! Let's kill the Captain and order some strippers! [Bender walks up to Hermes.] [in a different tone] Yeah, what he said. [Bender walks up to Fry and points at him with both his hands.] [in his regular tone] It's a mutiny led by Fry!"
Möbius Dick,Leela," That's enough insubordination, Mr. Fry!"
Möbius Dick,Bender, [in a different tone] String 'im up!
Möbius Dick,Bender, Things look bad enough without having to look closer at them. [Bender sees the four-dimensional space whale and gasps loudly.] Look! Off in the distance! It's exhaling!
Möbius Dick,Leela, [off camera] Use boaty talk!
Möbius Dick,Bender, Thare she blows!
Möbius Dick,Leela," Alright. [Fry, Zoidberg, Hermes, Bender, and Amy look at Leela.] Which of you space dogs has the guts and know-how to harpoon that whale?"
Möbius Dick,Amy, I spent a semester in Africa harpooning giraffes. And giraffes are basically just land space whales.
Möbius Dick,Leela," Miss Wong, you have the 'poon."
Möbius Dick,Amy," Oh, God! I'm having a Serengeti flashback! [furiously] Die, you dirty giraffe!"
Möbius Dick,Amy," Well, I got it. Now what, Captain?"
Möbius Dick,Leela," You know, I'm not sure. [Leela turns to her left. The four-dimensional space whale, which is seen through the window, continues flying.] I guess I thought whales died when you harpooned them."
Möbius Dick,Leela, [off camera] Don't worry.
Möbius Dick,Leela, I'll drop the anchor.
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg, Ouch.
Möbius Dick,Hermes, She's diving into the fourth dimension!
Möbius Dick,Amy, We have to cut the rope!
Möbius Dick,Leela," Negative, Sailor Moon. [Leela lets go of the anchor.] We're goin' for a sleigh ride."
Möbius Dick,Hermes, I can see sideways in time.
Möbius Dick,Amy," Gee, I see CGI. [Amy rotates to the right.] IGC ees I, eej."
Möbius Dick,Fry, Poop! [Fry laughs.] Poop!
Möbius Dick,Bender," Aw, yeah. [A highly duplicated Bender walks through the air.] [quickly, repeatedly] Bender! Bender! Bender!"
Möbius Dick,Bender, Aw. That was the greatest uncountably infinite bunch of guys I ever met.
Möbius Dick,Amy, Look out! [Amy points forward.] It's pulling us through a field of spacebergs!
Möbius Dick,Bender, Stupid rocks! [Amy looks at Bender.] Think they're so great!
Möbius Dick,Amy," Well, they are giant diamonds."
Möbius Dick,Bender, What?!
Möbius Dick,Bender, Come to papa!
Möbius Dick,Fry, A lotta Bender fell outta the crow's nest! [Fry points at the other camera with his left hand.] We need to cut the line!
Möbius Dick,Leela," Enough of your mad obsession with Bender, Fry! We've got to murder that whale or die trying."
Möbius Dick,Hermes, This has gone too far! [Hermes hits the table where he is working with both his hands and turns to his right.] Bender's one of Planet Express' most expensive appliances! And he's in trouble!
Möbius Dick,Leela," That's it! [Leela stands up.] I warned you. Fry, Zoidberg, I now pronounce you man and—"
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg, Aw! So close.
Möbius Dick,Leela," Unsit me, Mr. Conrad. We can't let the whale win! Hi-yah! [Leela kicks Hermes away. Hermes grunts. Leela pulls a knife out of her right boot with her right hand. Amy, Fry, and Bender turn to Leela.] [off camera] You're all too weak! [on camera] I can see that now. So I'll have to be my own crew! [Leela grabs the helmet on her chair, puts it on, and points at herself twice with her knife.] Understood? [in a different tone] You've gone mad, Captain. [in her regular tone] That's enough outta me! [Leela takes two steps forward.] Now come on! I gotta find that whale. [The four-dimensional space whale eats the part of the Planet Express ship where Hermes, Amy, Fry, and Bender are standing.] I found 'im! [Leela runs to what is now the edge of the Planet Express ship, jumps towards the four-dimensional space whale, passes her knife to her left hand, and screams.] With my Oxo Good Grips Cheese knife, I stab at thee. [Leela lands on the four-dimensional space whale and stabs it six times, grunting.] You do know I'm stabbing at thee, right?"
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg, Hello.
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth," Think, Zoidberg. [Professor Farnsworth rotates Zoidberg to the left.] You must remember something!"
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg," No! Nothing! For all I know, our friends could've been eaten by some kind of crazy space whale!"
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth, Damn that Bermuda Tetrahedron! [Professor Farnsworth grabs a shaving machine with his left hand.] It's taken my latest crew just as it took my first one!
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg, Not to mention those single socks from the dryer. Am I right?
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth," [angry] Shut up, Zoidberg! [Professor Farnsworth lets go of the shaving machine.] [sad] Oh, Zoidberg! [Professor Farnsworth puts both his hands around his head.] The grieving relatives will be gathered here tomorrow in need of comfort. [Professor Farnsworth removes his hands from his head as he walks, folds them, and turns to his left.] And, with no stone monument, they may well demand that I refund their admission fees."
Möbius Dick,Leela, Where are we?
Möbius Dick,<poem>Hermes, In the belly of the beast.
Möbius Dick,Fry, Like that Bible guy who got swallowed by the whale! Pinocchio!
Möbius Dick,Amy, This is all Obsessy Bessy's fault!
Möbius Dick,Bender," Right on, sister. We should be back at Planet Express right now. Hiding from work in the ceiling. But no!"
Möbius Dick,Leela," For the last time, I'm not obsessed. I just want this whale to die, die, die!"
Möbius Dick,Hermes, Uh-oh. What's that loud digesting sound?
Möbius Dick,Fry, [off camera] Holy crap! Four-dimensional bowels!
Möbius Dick,Amy, Einstein was right.
Möbius Dick,Leela," Why?! [Leela hits the wall with her right hand.] Why?! [Leela hits the wall with her right hand again.] Also, what and how?!"
Möbius Dick,Male voice, The great fish has chosen you for a higher purpose.
Möbius Dick,Leela, It's a great mammal! [Leela points at the wall to her right.] See? It's got whiskers! And I saw it lactating earlier. [Leela looks to her left.] Wait. [Leela turns to her left.] Who said that?
Möbius Dick,Deformed man," I was once Lando Tucker, captain of the first Planet Express ship."
Möbius Dick,Leela," Ew! I'm Turanga Leela, captain of the current Planet Express ship. What's going on?"
Möbius Dick,Lando Tucker," It's very simple. Well, actually, it's very complicated. Luckily, I'm here to explain it. You see... This space whale feeds on... Obsession!"
Möbius Dick,Leela, Wow. Are you gross-looking. Go on.
Möbius Dick,Lando Tucker, The great space serpent—
Möbius Dick,Leela, [whispering] Mammal.
Möbius Dick,Lando Tucker, [continued] Figured out long ago that no one's more obsessed than space captains.
Möbius Dick,Leela, Oh! [Leela grunts.] What are these things?! [Leela fights off the tentacles.] Get away!
Möbius Dick,Lando Tucker, The whale's nearly sucked me dry. It'll need a new source of obsession once I'm gone.
Möbius Dick,Leela, How many times do I have to tell other people? I'm not obsessed!
Möbius Dick,Lando Tucker," The whale is obsession, Leela! And you are the whale!"
Möbius Dick,Leela," [angry] I am not the whale! All I wanted was to complete my delivery. Is that too much to ask? One chicken-pickin' delivery? This whale's gonna pay! It can't escape what it already is. Me! I am the whale! [The camera zooms out, revealing that Leela's flesh has melded with that of the four-dimensional space whale.] [calm] See?"
Möbius Dick,Old lady," Fifty years, Junior! Fifty years of grippling sorrow!"
Möbius Dick,Paper-hatted salesman, Popsicles here. Can't mourn the dead without a popsicle.
Möbius Dick,Leo, You think a popsicle gonna bring my daughter back?!
Möbius Dick,Paper-hatted salesman," No, sir."
Möbius Dick,Leo, You just talked yourself out of a sale.
Möbius Dick,Inez, Poor Amy! My days of joy and luck are over! [Leo comforts Inez.] Guess I gotta quit that club.
Möbius Dick,Morris, I can't believe our Leela's gone!
Möbius Dick,Munda, You always think you're gonna disappear in space before your children.
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth," Welcome, everyone. [Zoidberg is eating a popsicle.] What a pleasure to see so many miserable faces."
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg, Mmm! Lemony!
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth," I had intended to unveil a beautiful stone memorial today. But, due to the recent tragedy, I humbly ask you to join me in a simple prayer."
Möbius Dick,"Munda, Morris, Inez, Leo, Dwight, and LaBarbara", [extendedly] Boo!
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth," No refunds! [Professor Farnsworth raises his right fist.] Shut up and bow your heads! [Munda, Morris, Inez, Leo, Dwight, LaBarbara, the old lady, and the old man close their eyes and bow their heads. Zoidberg does not. Professor Farnsworth raises his hands.] Oh, mighty Isis—"
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg," Oh, no! [Zoidberg stands up.] My deal is doing the thing!"
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth, Good Lord! It's some kind of inter-dimensional space whale!
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg," I just remembered. [Zoidberg's fin disappears.] That's the guy! [Zoidberg grows unkempt, brown hair.] Oy! Now with the horror hair."
Möbius Dick,Paper-hatted salesman, Popsicles! Fill your gapin' mouth with a popsicle!
Möbius Dick,Munda, [off camera] Leela! [on camera] You're alive! [Munda points at Leela with her left hand.] Is that how you and your friends are dressing now?!
Möbius Dick,Leela," Hello, everyone. I suppose you're wonderin' why my flesh has melded with that of a giant space whale."
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth, I'll admit to a polite interest.
Möbius Dick,Leela," At first, I was consumed by a dark obsession to kill the whale. Then I was consumed by the whale."
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg," That sounds clever, but it doesn't explain much."
Möbius Dick,Leela," Shut up, Zoidberg!"
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg, Okay.
Möbius Dick,Leela," You see, beneath my obsession lay an even deeper obsession. An obsession so strong, it allowed me to overpower the beast's will and pilot it through space and time. An obsession... With completing my [echoing] delivery!"
Möbius Dick,Paper-hatted salesman, Get your—
Möbius Dick,Old lady, [sad] Poor Lando... [happy] This is just how I want to remember him.
Möbius Dick,Leela, Too bad! 'Cause he's still alive!
Möbius Dick,Old lady, Lando?
Möbius Dick,Lando Tucker," Told you I'd be back. [Lando Tucker puts his right hand on the old lady's left shoulder and the old man puts his right hand on her right arm.] [to the old man] You've grown, Junior."
Möbius Dick,Old man, [indignant] I'm sixty-one.
Möbius Dick,Inez, I dunno him! What else you got?!
Möbius Dick,Farnsworth, They haven't aged a day! [LaBarbara and Dwight walk away. Professor Farnsworth grabs Candy's right arm with both his hands. Leo and Inez walk away.] The whale must have some kind of Möbius colon that endlessly recycles time and space!
Möbius Dick,Scruffy, Yup. That stands up to scrutiny.
Möbius Dick,Leela, I should've listened to my crew. [Leela turns to the four-dimensional space whale.] That space whale wasn't a monster. [Leela turns to the others.] It was the obsession of me and others like me that made it into a monster.
Möbius Dick,Lando Tucker, Mainly you.
Möbius Dick,Leela," On the other hand, the stupid fish did eat us. You guys wanna do this?"
Möbius Dick,Amy, Yeah!
Möbius Dick,Fry, You know it!
Möbius Dick,Candy," So, Johnny, are we gonna pick up where we left off?"
Möbius Dick,Zoidberg, Eh!
Möbius Dick,,
Law and Oracle,,
Law and Oracle,Fry," [voice-over] After centuries as a delivery boy, nothin' surprises me."
Law and Oracle,Zoidberg," You stink, loser."
Law and Oracle,Leela," [off camera] Hey, Fry! [Leela enters.] Pizza goin' out. Come on!"
Law and Oracle,Fry, Alright. I'll take the red rocket.
Law and Oracle,Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for... [Fry takes a piece of paper from his pocket.] D. Frosted Wang? [Fry grunts.] Not another crank delivery! Why don't I read these things ahead of time?! [Ipji, Terry, and Lou step out of the cryo-tube shadows and burst out laughing.] One time was funny. But, every week for ten years, not as funny."
Law and Oracle,Ipji, True. Not as funny. But still somewhat funny.
Law and Oracle,Fry, And... And then they burst out laughing a second time. [All but Fry laugh. Fry sighs.] I've been a delivery boy for a thousand years. Isn't there any room for promotion around here?
Law and Oracle,Hermes," There'll be no promotions unless somebody dies. And, even then, only if we can bring 'em back as a zombie like Scruffy."
Law and Oracle,Scruffy, Life and death are a seamless continuum.
Law and Oracle,Fry," Well, could I at least get some encouragement? I could use a shot in the arm. [Shots are fired from outside the building, piercing the window that is the closest to the crew. Fry falls down and screams.] I got shot in the leg!"
Law and Oracle,Bender, Roberto! [Roberto approaches the table.] What are you doin' here?
Law and Oracle,Roberto, What? A fella can't drop in on ol' friends and hold 'em hostage?
Law and Oracle,Zoidberg, [calm] I'm good! And you?
Law and Oracle,Smitty," [off camera, on a speaker] Attention, criminal Robot in the building."
Law and Oracle,Smitty," [off-camera, on a speaker] Come out with your hands up."
Law and Oracle,Bender, Never!
Law and Oracle,Smitty," [off-camera, on a speaker] Uh, other guy."
Law and Oracle,Roberto," Listen up, piggies! I want a hovercopter. And a non-marked sandwich. And a new face with, like, a... A Hugh Grant look."
Law and Oracle,Roberto," [off-camera] And, every five minutes I don't get it, someone's gonna get stabbed in the ass!"
Law and Oracle,Zoidberg, [off-camera] He's bluffing. [A stabbing sound is heard.] Ouch!
Law and Oracle,Zoidberg, He's not bluffing!
Law and Oracle,URL, You call for a chopper?
Law and Oracle,Roberto, Nah. I specifically said hovercopter.
Law and Oracle,URL, One chopper comin' up.
Law and Oracle,Smitty," You know, URL. [URL has entered the hovercar.] Sometimes it's almost too much for me."
Law and Oracle,URL, You mean the respect we get and the high level of job satisfaction?
Law and Oracle,Smitty," There's that, but I'm also talkin' about the non-stop promotions and the free hot ride."
Law and Oracle,Leela," I do love a man in uniform. [Fry clears his throat, laying emphasis on his delivery-boy uniform.] I mean a uniform that doesn't involve short pants."
Law and Oracle,Fry, I can see I have no future here. My only option is to resign with dignity. [Fry takes his shorts off and gives them to Hermes.] Here are my shorts.
Law and Oracle,Fry, Hello. I'd like to enrol in Police Academy.
Law and Oracle,Policeman #1, You think you can just waltz in here with no pants and become a cop?
Law and Oracle,Fry, That's the plan.
Law and Oracle,Policeman #1," I like you, kid. I got no pants on either."
Law and Oracle,Fry, I can see that. You're quite a bit taller than me.
Law and Oracle,Policeman #1, Welcome to Police Academy.
Law and Oracle,Fry, Hi! I'm Fry.
Law and Oracle,Brown Robot, I'm the Sound Effects 5000.
Law and Oracle,Fry, Wow! That would be impressive if you were a Human!
Law and Oracle,Sound Effects 5000, [sad] Yeah...
Law and Oracle,Policeman #2, On your feet for Chief O'Mannahan.
Law and Oracle,Chief O'Mannahan," At ease, cadets. I'll make this short and sweet 'cause I'm PMS-in' like a lumberjack. Police Academy is not for everybody. You're gonna get your boobs scuffed. But, if you got the vulva to stick it out, I'll be proud to call you ladies policemen."
Law and Oracle,Fry," Sir! Yes, ma'am!"
Law and Oracle,Black-haired man, Yeah. That's great. [The black-haired man approaches the driver's window.] Now can you actually turn on the ignition?
Law and Oracle,Sound Effects 5000, [sad] I don't have any hands.
Law and Oracle,Chief O'Mannahan," Well, it's that time of the month. Graduation Day. So grow up hair and put 'em together for our new officers."
Law and Oracle,Amy, [off camera] Woohoo!
Law and Oracle,Bender, Hooray for the pigs!
Law and Oracle,Chief O'Mannahan," Graduates, you are hereby officially cops. Now movin' along. Nothin' to see here."
Law and Oracle,Zoidberg," Hooray! Free sky sticks! [A lightsaber falls on Zoidberg's head, ridding him of his crust.] Ooh. [Zoidberg points his finger accusingly.] Police brutality!"
Law and Oracle,Chief O'Mannahan," [to herself] Nice... [The camera zooms out, revealing two tables where eight policemen, including URL and Fry, are sitting.] [to the policemen] Alright. Before we head out, I'll be teaming up our new officers with their ironically matched partners. Sound Effects 5000, you'll be with Gretsky."
Law and Oracle,Gretsky," Ow, my tinnitus!"
Law and Oracle,Chief O'Mannahan," Fry, due to the unfortunate loss of Officer Smith, you'll be riding with URL."
Law and Oracle,URL, And Smitty was just a few days from retirement.
Law and Oracle,Fry, Wuh— What happened?
Law and Oracle,URL, He took a early retirement. Damn.
Law and Oracle,Farnsworth, Let's get down to business.
Law and Oracle,Amy," Aren't you gonna say [imitating Professor Farnsworth's voice] Good news, everyone?"
Law and Oracle,Farnsworth," No, I just said that for Fry's benefit. May the poor fellow feel better about his pointless job."
Law and Oracle,Hermes," As much as I miss 'im, he didn't really serve much purpose around here. [Leela and Amy open their eyes.] Though he did walk Zoidberg."
Law and Oracle,Farnsworth," In any case, I've improved on Fry by sticking some wheels on a board so Leela and Bender can easily make the next delivery without him."
Law and Oracle,Bender, Neat. So where are we goin'?
Law and Oracle,Farnsworth, Pandora.
Law and Oracle,Leela," That dangerous, 3-D planet? Can't we just send our avatars?"
Law and Oracle,Farnsworth, No! It's cheaper just to have you die.
Law and Oracle,Fry, Whoa! Fifteen miles over the speed of light.
Law and Oracle,URL," That's a violation of the law of Lorentz invariance, baby."
Law and Oracle,Fry, Light 'em up.
Law and Oracle,URL, Look out for that particular individual.
Law and Oracle,Dandy Jim," An electric wall, eh? I can't see the harm in peein' on that."
Law and Oracle,URL, Whoa! Where my man learn that?
Law and Oracle,Fry, SunnyD commercial.
Law and Oracle,URL, Let's refract this sucker.
Law and Oracle,Fry," DNA and career chip, please."
Law and Oracle,URL," Erwin Schrödinger, huh? What's in the box, Schrödinger?"
Law and Oracle,Erwin Schrödinger," Um... A cat, some poison, und a caesium atom."
Law and Oracle,Fry, The cat! Is it alive or dead? [Schrödinger is not given the time to reply.] Alive or dead?!
Law and Oracle,URL," Answer him, fool."
Law and Oracle,Erwin Schrödinger, It's a superposition of both states until you open it and collapse the wave function.
Law and Oracle,Fry, Says you.
Law and Oracle,URL, There's also a lotta drugs in there.
Law and Oracle,Leela, So... You're a Robot?
Law and Oracle,Chief O'Mannahan, You boys did good. Nailed a major violator of the laws of Physics.
Law and Oracle,URL, He's goin' down. [URL lifts up Schrödinger's cat.] Cat's gonna testify.
Law and Oracle,Chief O'Mannahan, Guys like this really bust my uterus. You're both getting a promotion! Ever heard of the Future Crimes Division?
Law and Oracle,Fry, Tomorrow I have.
Law and Oracle,Leela, [off camera] Oops.
Law and Oracle,Leela, I can't make out a thing!
Law and Oracle,Bender," Well, I guess you should've had two eyes!"
Law and Oracle,Leela, Just deliver the package and let's get outta here.
Law and Oracle,Bender, Screw that! [Bender kicks the board back to Leela.] I ain't no delivery boy! I'm the company's chef.
Law and Oracle,Leela," Oh! You're the chef, are you? [Leela stands up.] Then why don't you make us something nice to eat?"
Law and Oracle,Bender, [muttering] I'll make you something— [Bender leaves the room and the door closes. It is opened as Bender re-enters.] [angry] Here's your damn peanut butter and jelly sandwich!
Law and Oracle,Blond man," Now that we can predict crimes with 99% accuracy, we can arrest most perpetrators before they even perpetrate anything."
Law and Oracle,Fry, That's ridiculous. Only horoscopes can predict the future.
Law and Oracle,Blond man," That's what we used to think. Until we invented... [The blond man opens the door, revealing it to lead to no elevator, but to another room, in the middle of which there is a Robot lying on a tub with his eyes closed.] This."
Law and Oracle,Fry, Whoa!
Law and Oracle,URL," Slowed on, baby."
Law and Oracle,Blond man, The cybernetic oracle. The ultimate man-machine hybrid. Programmed with every crime ever recorded and implanted with the brain cells of History's greatest detectives. We call 'im... Pickles.
Law and Oracle,Fry, On account of it's like he's floating in a jar?
Law and Oracle,Blond man," Exactly. The oracle's visions are recorded on these coloured balls. [The blond man lifts up a box containing four balls  One green, one black, one red, and one white with pink stains.] Green is larceny. Black is fraud. Red, homicide."
Law and Oracle,Fry, What's pink pocodots?
Law and Oracle,Blond man," Clown slaughter. It happens more often than you think. [An alarm goes off and a red light flashes. Pickles' brain begins sparking. A red ball surfaces in the tub.] Clutter in the ball! [The blond man reaches the ball with a fishing net.] Red ball, homicide!"
Law and Oracle,Fry, [extendedly] Woo!
Law and Oracle,Blond man," Suspect  Male, six-foot-one, distinctive mustard stain on his forehead."
Law and Oracle,Hattie, [on the video] My kajigger!
Law and Oracle,Blond man, Victim  Hattie McDoogal.
Law and Oracle,Fry, Look! The clock says 5 08. [Fry looks at his wrist.] It's 4 30 right now!
Law and Oracle,URL, Uh-oh. We only have a half hour to chill out before we head over.
Law and Oracle,Old man," Oh, Hattie. When I look into your one good eye, I see a reflection of beauty."
Law and Oracle,Hattie," Oh, fresh."
Law and Oracle,URL," Freeze, fool."
Law and Oracle,Fry, You're under arrest for future murder!
Law and Oracle,Old man, Ja? [The old man jumps to behind the couch.] You can't arrest me for future murder after it's right-now murder!
Law and Oracle,Hattie," My kajigger! [The old man accidentally opens the cage with the snow globe, causing the birds to start flying around him. He drops the snow globe, screams, and is handcuffed by Fry and URL.] So he didn't really wanna marry me?"
Law and Oracle,URL," Nah. See, he knew you'd left everything to your parakeets in your will."
Law and Oracle,Fry," He was gonna murder you, marry your parakeets, and then poison them with an arsenic-laced cuttlebone."
Law and Oracle,URL," Classic move. Aw, yeah."
Law and Oracle,Chief O'Mannahan, Congratulations on your big bust.
Law and Oracle,Fry, You too.
Law and Oracle,Chief O'Mannahan," Keep it up and you boys might just make detective. Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go drop a big one."
Law and Oracle,Fry, Wow! I can't believe it. One more promotion and I'll be a real detective. Like Sherlock Holmes or Speed Buggy.
Law and Oracle,Chief O'Mannahan, Eight pounds. I'm namin' 'er Bert!
Law and Oracle,URL," Mazel tov, Chief. That's a beautiful bathroom baby."
Law and Oracle,URL," Ain't you headin' home, Phil?"
Law and Oracle,Fry, In a minute. I just wanna finish this paperless work.
Law and Oracle,URL, Don't stay up too late. We gotta lotta people to shoot tomorrow.
Law and Oracle,Fry, Hello? Anyone? [Fry grunts.] There's never a cop around when you need one.
Law and Oracle,Female voice," Green ball, larceny."
Law and Oracle,Fry," The thief seems to be some sorta ghost. Or is he? [Fry zooms in, revealing the thief to be Bender. Fry gasps.] Bender?!"
Law and Oracle,Hermes," [off camera] Item seven. [The camera zooms out, revealing that Zoidberg, Professor Farnsworth, Amy, and Hermes are sitting at the conference table. Hermes is looking at a set of paper sheets.] Our corporate tax rate remained unchanged this fiscal year."
Law and Oracle,Amy, That's not funny.
Law and Oracle,Hermes, It's not supposed to be funny. It's a business meetin'.
Law and Oracle,Zoidberg, Things used to be funny around here! Noses were picked. Pants fell down. So what changed? Only Fry could say... And he's gone!
Law and Oracle,Amy, Hey! Bender and Leela are back from Pandora. How was it?
Law and Oracle,Leela, Awful. We had nothing to say to each other. [Leela sits down.] So we had to listen to Bender's Eagles album for twenty-seven hours.
Law and Oracle,Bender," Beats talkin' to you, ""Witchy Woman"". [Fry enters, dressed in his NNYPD uniform, looking serious. The crew cheers.] Hey, meatbag!"
Law and Oracle,Hermes, Look at you!
Law and Oracle,Leela, Hubba-hubba. Your pants go almost all the way to your ankles!
Law and Oracle,Fry," Good afternoon, individuals. [to Bender] Sir, would you mind stepping outta the building?"
Law and Oracle,Bender," Normally, when a cop asks me that, I spray whipped cream in his eyes and run away. But, to ditch these losers, gladly."
Law and Oracle,Fry," Bender, be honest with me. Are you planning a big heist?"
Law and Oracle,Bender," Usually, but not at the moment."
Law and Oracle,Fry, I only ask 'cause the oracle thinks you're gonna pull of a major theft next Thursday.
Law and Oracle,Bender," Next Thursday, you say? Pray, continue."
Law and Oracle,Fry, Are you familiar with this particular location?
Law and Oracle,Bender, I may have a burgling familiarity with it.
Law and Oracle,Fry, Does the word Maltese mean anything to you?
Law and Oracle,Bender, The Maltese Liquor?! The strongest and most valuable malt liquor ever brewed! And soon it will be mine... [Bender laughs evilly.] I'm sorry. You were sayin'?
Law and Oracle,Fry," Bender, I'm only tellin' you this so you can avoid committing the crime."
Law and Oracle,Bender," [while writing on the pad] ""Avoid committing the crime"". Got it."
Law and Oracle,Fry," You wrote ""Commit the crime""!"
Law and Oracle,Fry," There's gotta be some way to stop Bender. [Fry strokes his chin.] Maybe something in the oracle's prediction that I missed before due to incompetence. [Fry continues moving the photographs around. He stops at the one showing the gun.] Wait. Who's the trigger-happy jerk? [Fry rewinds and zooms out, revealing the shooter to be himself. He gasps.] That's me. I recognise the face."
Law and Oracle,Bender, [on the video] You shot me. You miserable dingus!
Law and Oracle,Fry, No! No! What have I will have done?
Law and Oracle,URL," Man, that's heavy. [Fry is alarmed. The camera zooms out, revealing that URL is standing behind Fry.] Osmium heavy."
Law and Oracle,Fry, Are you gonna turn me in for concealing evidence?
Law and Oracle,URL," Say what? You're my partner, home-Fry. [URL puts his hand on Fry's shoulder.] Besides, I got my own secrets."
Law and Oracle,Chief O'Mannahan, Anything big worth checkin' out?
Law and Oracle,URL," Just your big, jangly booty, baby."
Law and Oracle,Chief O'Mannahan," See ya tonight, toots."
Law and Oracle,Fry, [confused] You... And— And the Chief?!
Law and Oracle,URL," We been gettin' it on. Right there in your chair. [URL points to the chair where Fry is sitting. Fry looks disgusted.] I'm like, ""Oh, baby! Oh, baby!"" And she's like, [in a deeper voice] ""Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."""
Law and Oracle,Fry, I would never shoot Bender! Never! He taught me how to shave.
Law and Oracle,URL," Revision ball. By decidin' not to shoot Bender, you created an alternate future."
Law and Oracle,Fry, [on the video] I could never shoot you! Never! You taught me how to shave.
Law and Oracle,Fry, See?
Law and Oracle,Fry, [on the video] Just get outta here. [Fry puts the gun down and closes his eyes.] Go!
Law and Oracle,URL, Now dig the unintended consequences.
Law and Oracle,Bender," [on the video] My friends, let us share this booze in a toast to our dear friend, Bender. [Everyone drinks. All but Bender start suffocating and fall down, dead. The coffins of Amy, Hermes, Professor Farnsworth, Zoidberg, and Leela close by themselves. Fry walks up to Leela's coffin and puts a flower on it. Bender is also there.] Oops."
Law and Oracle,URL, [on the video] The Maltese Liquor done destroyed their brains. Fools should've known it's fatal for anyone but Robots and Billy Dee Williams.
Law and Oracle,Fry," So, if I don't shoot Bender, all my other friends will die?!"
Law and Oracle,URL, Fate is a freaky mistress. Much like the Chief. Look out!
Law and Oracle,Fry, Somethin' is not right. I refuse to believe it. Rewind!
Law and Oracle,Hedonism Bot, Ooh. Are you the calloused working man I ordered?
Law and Oracle,Bender, Uh... [Bender looks the other way.] Sure.
Law and Oracle,Bender," In order to fix your leaky roof, I'll need to spend two or three hours down here in the wine cellar."
Law and Oracle,Hedonism Bot, I'll be upstairs putting batteries and things.
Law and Oracle,Bender," Whoa! [Bender zooms in on a table sustaining the bottle of Maltese Liquor with his eyes.] The Maltese Liquor! [Bender zooms out and takes off his moustache and belt.] Forty ounces of Heaven! [The dog shown by one of the photographs appears and barks angrily. Bender grabs a slice of steak from his chest cabinet.] Here, boy. [The dog stops barking.] This is for you. [Bender knocks the dog unconscious with the slice of steak and eats it as he walks towards the table.] Ah! [Bender arrives at the table, hums, grabs a dynamite cylinder from his chest cabinet, lights the dynamite cylinder with his finger, grabs a cigar from his chest cabinet, puts the cigar in his mouth, lights the cigar with the dynamite cylinder, closes his chest door, and exhales smoke towards the bottle on the table, revealing the safe shown by one of the photographs.] Invisible safe, eh? [Bender giggles, is alarmed by the imminent explosion of the dynamite cylinder, screams, dropping the cigar, and places the dynamite cylinder on the safe. The dynamite cylinder explodes, causing the safe's door to open. Bender uncovers his ears and rubs his hands.] Aw, yeah, baby. [Bender grabs the bottle.] Two-hundred-and-ten proof."
Law and Oracle,Fry," That's all the proof I need. [The camera zooms out, revealing that Fry is pointing a gun at Bender.] Put the bottle back!"
Law and Oracle,Bender, We both know I won't do that! Either you're gonna shoot me or I'm gonna spray whipped cream in your eyes and walk outta here like a big shot.
Law and Oracle,Fry," Bender, no! You don't have to do something just 'cause it's gonna happen! The future's making a chump outta you!"
Law and Oracle,Bender," Oh, yeah?! [Bender puts the bottle on the table.] Well, I'm gonna make a chump outta the future! I'm not stealin' anything."
Law and Oracle,Fry, Yes! I stopped the crime without shooting you. The oracle was wrong!
Law and Oracle,Male voice, [off camera] Was I?
Law and Oracle,Fry, Pickles?!
Law and Oracle,Pickles," Yes. It is I, Pickles! I set the whole thing up. Everyone will think Bender's the thief, while I make off with that glorious brew."
Law and Oracle,Bender, [confused] Seriously? Why?
Law and Oracle,Pickles, So I can kill my Human brain cells. Do you have any idea what a burden it is to know everything that will ever happen?! To never be surprised. To know the punch line of every joke hours in advance.
Law and Oracle,Fry, Like watching Leno.
Law and Oracle,Pickles," And that is why I faked the prediction of this crime. Nevertheless, stay with me here. [Pickles begins walking.] Things will now happen just as I fake-predicted. [Pickles points the gun at Bender.] Bender, you're going to hand me that bottle. [Bender reaches for the bottle on the table.] Not that one! The real one. Which you switched when Fry stupidly looked away."
Law and Oracle,Fry, Hey!
Law and Oracle,Bender," Aw, man. Why do you gotta be so oracle-y?"
Law and Oracle,Pickles," Fry... You are going to shoot Bender, killing him and shattering the fake bottle. Just as I predicted. [Pickles points the gun at Fry.] Do it! It is your destiny!"
Law and Oracle,Fry," Funny thing about destiny. [Fry points his gun at Pickles.] Sometimes fate has other plans. [Fry shoots in Pickles' direction, hitting the invisible safe, which redirects the shot to Bender. Bender screams, drops the bottle, and falls down.] Oh, nuts."
Law and Oracle,Bender, You shot me! You miserable dingus!
Law and Oracle,Pickles," And now the part I didn't show you. [Pickles shoots Fry. Fry screams and falls down.] Everyone will think Bender killed you. [Pickles places his gun in Bender's hand.] And I walk away with a goofy juice. [Pickles walks towards a mirror, laughs evilly, opens the real bottle, and drinks the malt liquor. Pickles' brain begins sparking and Pickles makes sounds of both pain and pleasure. His brain is now significantly smaller.] Finally... Blissful ignorance! I have no idea what's going to happen next!"
Law and Oracle,Fry," [off camera] Did you get that, Chief?"
Law and Oracle,Chief O'Mannahan, We got it all from behind this prediction-proof glass.
Law and Oracle,Pickles, But... How could you know my prediction was fake?
Law and Oracle,Fry," I knew somethin' was wrong, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Then it hit me. [Fry presses the NNYPD badge on his helmet and a hologram of Bender sharing the malt liquor in the Planet Express conference room is projected from his nose.] You showed Bender sharing the deadly booze with our friends. [Fry presses the NNYPD badge and the hologram disappears.] Bender would never share!"
Law and Oracle,Bender, The very idea!
Law and Oracle,Fry, So we set up this little charade based on an episode of Speed Buggy.
Law and Oracle,URL, With the added benefit of me and the Chief bein' locked in a small room.
Law and Oracle,Hedonism Bot, Shall we adjourn to the dungeon?
Law and Oracle,Fry," Well, I got my shield for stopping Bender. [Fry lifts up his NNYPD badge. Zoidberg, Amy, Professor Farnsworth, Leela, Hermes, and Bender are sitting at the conference table. They all cheer.] But then I got fired for tipping off Bender."
Law and Oracle,Farnsworth," Fry, we have no idea what you do around here, but we desperately need you back."
Law and Oracle,Fry," Ruh— Really? Um, I don't suppose there's any chance I can get a promotion..."
Law and Oracle,Farnsworth, Sure! What the heck! I hereby promote you to... [Professor Farnsworth stands up.] Executive delivery boy!
Law and Oracle,Fry, Executive?!
Law and Oracle,Hermes," [whispering to Leela] It's a meanin'less title, but it helps insecure people feel better about themselves."
Law and Oracle,Fry, I feel better about myself!
Law and Oracle,,
Benderama,,
Benderama,Hermes," So there it is, people. Due to budget cutbacks, we will no longer be offering free squid guts in the kitcken."
Benderama,Farnsworth," Oh, boo-hoo! Everyone, look at my latest invention."
Benderama,Zoidberg, [monotonously] Okay.
Benderama,Amy, I like how it's not killing us so far.
Benderama,Farnsworth, It takes any object and makes two smaller copies!
Benderama,Bender, [criticisingly] Why?
Benderama,Farnsworth," You see... As I age, I've been shrinking and feeling colder. So now I need twice as many sweaters in a smaller size. First, I scan the old sweater. [He puts a sweater on the replicator screen and presses a button. It scans the sweater like a Xerox machine.] Then, we add some matter. Any old, useless matter will do. [He dumps a book labelled Zoidberg's Wedding Album into it.] Now, the matter prism reorganises the raw material into two smaller copies."
Benderama,Fry, So that's where babies' sweaters come from!
Benderama,The Scary Door narrator," Enclosed as a PDF attachment, a picture of yourself in a boat on a river. It's a river that flows in two directions. Make that three. It's a magic river, that's how. And it's flowing down the eerie canal to... The Scary Door. That's eerie with two Es. [Close-up  A scientist's laboratory. The scientist finishes welding a Robot.] Consider, if you have the energy, Dr. Daniel Zenus, an inventor with a terminal case of the lazies."
Benderama,Dr. Daniel Zenus," This Robot will do everything for me. Robot, activate yourself and do my research. [The Robot flips its own on switch and powers up. It begins tinkering with test tubes as the scientist leans back in a chair with a pillow.] Ah!"
Benderama,Dr. Daniel Zenus," Next, assume my social obligations."
Benderama,Official," Dr. Zenus, for a lifetime of scientific achievement, we present this award to... Your Robot."
Benderama,Boy," Daddy, I love you."
Benderama,Dr. Daniel Zenus," If only I'd programmed the Robot to be more careful what I wished for. Robot, experience this tragic irony for me."
Benderama,Robot, [extendedly] No!
Benderama,Dr. Daniel Zenus, Ah!
Benderama,Bender, Ah!
Benderama,Fry," Man, I wish we had a Robot to do stuff."
Benderama,Bender," I know, right?"
Benderama,Farnsworth," Bender, thank God I found you in time. I need someone in the lab immediately to fold my new sweaters."
Benderama,Bender, I'm sorry. Do you see a Robot in this room named Folder?
Benderama,Farnsworth," Fortunately, I came prepared with a backup phrasing. Uh, Bender, would you mind bending my new sweaters? There's only two of them."
Benderama,Bender," Hey! Oh! You want me to do two things? Man, I'd call my lawyer if diallin' the phone wasn't such a hassle."
Benderama,[Bender leaves.],
Benderama,[Scene, The Planet Express laboratory. Bender enters and sees the two unfolded sweaters. He mutters.]
Benderama,<poem>Bender," Razzle, frazzle, two things! [Bender sees the replicator.] Ooh. Razzle, frazzle, duplicator. [Bender gets it up, puts it in his chest, presses the start button, closes his chest door, and laughs.] Now for some tasty matter. [He eats some and quickly gobbles a chair, a microscope, and a glass tank filled with white rats. The machine glows as it did earlier. We hear a ding, he opens his chest door, and two 60%-scaled mini-Benders pop out.] Howdy, fellas! I'm Bender."
Benderama,Bender duplicate," Go to hell, old man."
Benderama,Bender," I like your attitude. Let's party. But, first, fold these two sweaters."
Benderama,Bender duplicates, [in unison] I'm sorry. Do you see a Robot in this room named Folder?
Benderama,Bender," Damn, you're cute."
Benderama,Bender," Hi! I'm Bender, this is my Robot Bender, and this is my other Robot Bender."
Benderama,Leela," Oh, Lord."
Benderama,Bender," They're 60%-scaled replicas of me, Bender."
Benderama,Leela, Does that mean they only do 60% of the work you do or that they actually do more work because they're only 60% as lazy?
Benderama,Bender, Shut up. [The three Benders laugh.] That's a good one.
Benderama,Farnsworth," Enough good ones, everyone. We have a delivery to an Alien space giant."
Benderama,Hermes, You'll have to be respectful. This customer is fifty-feet tall and sensitive about his appearance.
Benderama,Amy," Colossal tooth whitener, mega deodorant, humongous acne cream... Aw, and one regular-sized condom."
Benderama,Bender, All that and a small wiener? This guy's got it goin' on.
Benderama,Leela, [whispering] Remember  Don't show any reaction to his appearance.
Benderama,Bender," I hope that's vanishing cream, 'cause that needs to go away."
Benderama,Bender duplicate, That's cold-blooded.
Benderama,Leela, Shhh!
Benderama,Unattractive giant monster, It's okay. I understand. My unusual appearance makes people nervous. You used humour to defuse the tension.
Benderama,Bender," Yup. And there's still a little more tension, so look out. [Bender readies his voice.] You so ugly, when trick-or-treaters come to your house, they give you candy."
Benderama,Bender duplicate #1," You so ugly, when you go to the bank, they ask you to put on a ski mask."
Benderama,Bender duplicate #2," You so ugly, you crack the Daily Mirror. It's a newspaper!"
Benderama,Unattractive giant monster," I wish it weren't so, but many of these things are true. Anyhow, you've lowered my self-esteem a bit more, but I'm sincerely grateful you came all this way to deliver my fungus chizzle."
Benderama,Fry," [sad] Don't feel bad, sir. It's not your fault. You probably just inherited your appearance from your mother."
Benderama,Unattractive giant monster, [furiously] What?! No one insults my momma.
Benderama,Bender," Oh, God! Shield your eyes! It's like Edward James Olmos on IMAX."
Benderama,Left Bender duplicate, Did you see his face when I said he's so ugly?
Benderama,Right Bender duplicate," No, I blacked out. 'Cause he's so ugly!"
Benderama,Bender," Hey, guys, quit reminiscing and grab me two cigars."
Benderama,Left Bender duplicate, One thing each?
Benderama,Right Bender duplicate, Sounds fair.
Benderama,Bender, Wait. Make that four cigars.
Benderama,Bender duplicates, [in unison] You want us to do four things?
Benderama,Hermes, My manwich!
Benderama,Bender duplicate," What's up, Shorty?"
Benderama,Bender," And that's the story of how one of me became two and two became four, makin' seven total. The end."
Benderama,Leela," I just like having the end locker. It's not like Amy cares about it at all. But no, she won't trade with me."
Benderama,Zoidberg, A rat!
Benderama,Leela, Yes! She is a rat!
Benderama,Zoidberg, No! Look!
Benderama,Very small Bender, Which way to the tiny hookers?
Benderama,Amy," A big, fat roach!"
Benderama,Hermes, What? I thought I put that away.
Benderama,Amy, No! There!
Benderama,Bender on the other side, Who're you?
Benderama,Insect-sized Bender, Bender sent me.
Benderama,Insect-sized Bender," Hey, I know that guy!"
Benderama,Farnsworth," Scruffy, what is that tiny Bender doing in my soup?!"
Benderama,Scruffy," It appears to be giving you the finger, sir. Enjoy."
Benderama,Bender duplicate, Help me! Help me! I'm too lazy to escape!
Benderama,Bender duplicate, Ow.
Benderama,Bender, What?
Benderama,Hermes, This place is crawling with yous!
Benderama,Bender," So there's more Benders around. As far as I'm concerned, that's good news!"
Benderama,Farnsworth," Bad news, everyone! Look at this infinite series representing the mass of successive generations of Benders."
Benderama,Fry, Don't wait for me.
Benderama,Farnsworth, It's nonconvergent!
Benderama,Fry," Oh, dip!"
Benderama,Farnsworth," Unless we quickly exterminate them, they'll replicate ad infinitum and consume all the matter on Earth. [Everyone gasps as the projector illustrates the situation.] According to my calculations, there are eleven generations at the moment. [The Professor holds a mini-Bender with a pair of tweezers.] That's 2046 total Benders we need to destroy."
Benderama,Bender, Wait. Does that include me?
Benderama,Bender, Too bad he didn't have his own Bible.
Benderama,Farnsworth, Just 2045 more to go!
Benderama,Hermes," 2045, 2046. That's it. We got 'em all except for the big one."
Benderama,Amy, Wait. [Amy grabs a small Bender from a white box.] This isn't a real Bender. It's a talking doll from when Bender had that sitcom about the city Robot who moves back to the farm.
Benderama,Bender doll," Shut your pumpkin, bumpkin."
Benderama,Bender, Alright. So I let one measly Bender get away. How much harm can one infinitely self-reproducing Robot do?
Benderama,Leela, Bender! How could you be so lazy and irresponsible?
Benderama,Bender," Wait, what? Did someone say I'm great?"
Benderama,Bender, What's with the grey goo?
Benderama,Microscopic Bender, Bite my tiny metal ass.
Benderama,Bender, Hey! Those jerklings ate my couch.
Benderama,Farnsworth," Oh, God. We've opened Pandora's fly. They'll reproduce without limit, consuming all the matter in the world."
Benderama,Fry, Like the Kardashians.
Benderama,Bender, Now they drank my booze?! They've gone too far!
Benderama,Leela, Wait a second. All Benders are powered by alcohol!
Benderama,Farnsworth," Of course! Long before the Benders devour the Earth, they'll deplete the planet's booze and die off. This is a problem that will solve itself."
Benderama,Bender," A problem that solves itself? That sounds like a job for me, Bender."
Benderama,Morbo," Our top story  All alcohol on Earth has mysteriously disappeared. Consequences are minimal, except among the most hardened alcoholics. Linda?"
Benderama,Linda, [nervously] I can no longer face my children!
Benderama,Leela," Crisis averted. Without alcohol, the Benders are dying off!"
Benderama,Scruffy," A greater tragedy my eyes have never beheld. Well, into the terlet."
Benderama,Bender," So sober, so weak..."
Benderama,Leela, Things really worked out nicely this time.
Benderama,Farnsworth, This doesn't taste like old-man water.
Benderama,Farnsworth, [from the bathroom] Everyone to The Situation Room!
Benderama,Farnsworth," I was lying here, snoozing, dreaming, oddly enough, about bathing in champagne with six of the world's most distinguished scientists, when suddenly I realised my bathwater had been transformed into alcohol."
Benderama,Bender, Alcohol?
Benderama,Fry, Chug! Chug!
Benderama,Bender, It's like fine cognac with a hint of aged scrotum.
Benderama,Leela, How can this be? I thought the Benders drank all the alcohol in the world!
Benderama,Farnsworth," They did. But then they made more! You see, once the Benders reached atomic scale, they began directly manipulating water and CO2 molecules to make alcohol. [A microscopic Bender burps, burning the Professor's hand. The Professor screams effeminately.] In a matter of hours, there will be no more fresh water on Earth."
Benderama,Bender," Oh, no! What will I mix with my Scotch?"
Benderama,Linda," Hey, you! Good evening. Who're you calling drunk? You're not drunk! I'm drunk."
Benderama,Morbo," That's right, Linda. Water is now— Now booze and everyone's tetty much protally fitshaced."
Benderama,Linda," Turning to sports, the Indy 500 was today. There were no survivors."
Benderama,Amy, This chair is so comfortable.
Benderama,Bender, Classic Amy.
Benderama,Hermes, You wanna see a picture of my boy?
Benderama,Zoidberg, Sure. [Hermes shows him a photograph.] That's your penis!
Benderama,Hermes, That's my boy!
Benderama,Leela, I guess this is a... Not so bad. As long as we don't need to use our mental... Mental...
Benderama,Fry, Minds?
Benderama,Leela, Wha?
Benderama,Fry," No, listen. I... freakin' love you. But I don't throw that word around!"
Benderama,Farnsworth," Oh, I know you don't. That's why I love you. Are the pizza muffins ready?"
Benderama,Fry, He's here for revenging. That's why.
Benderama,Unattractive giant monster, No! Wait! I'm here to apologise.
Benderama,Leela, For your looks? [Leela laughs.] Nice one.
Benderama,Unattractive giant monster," Well, yes, actually. It is sort of related to that. Can we talk? Grabbing your spaceship was not okay. I lost my cool and I'm sorry. In group, I learned that I tend to be a bit..."
Benderama,Hermes, Repulsive?
Benderama,Unattractive giant monster," Sensitive. So now I'm, like, trying to work on my attitude and project an air of positivity."
Benderama,Zoidberg, You're projecting an air of something.
Benderama,Amy," You're so stinky, you need right guard and left guard."
Benderama,Unattractive giant monster, I'll take your hygiene advice to heart.
Benderama,Farnsworth, You're ugly!
Benderama,Unattractive giant monster, Hey! Ow!
Benderama,Zapp," Yo, freakshow! Your face has been declared a weapon of mass disgusting!"
Benderama,Kif, Timeless.
Benderama,Unattractive giant monster," Okay, deep breath, deep breath. [The monster takes two deep breaths and is shot again. He grabs a giant phone from his left pocket and makes a speed dial.] Dr. Lesterman? I'm sorry to bother you, but I think I'm close to a temper-control incident."
Benderama,Female voice, [on the phone] You have reached the office of Dr. Judy Lesterman and Dr. Ira Rodkiss. The office is now closed. If this is a pharmacy call—
Benderama,Unattractive giant monster," That's it! I promised myself I wouldn't do this, but I... [The monster kicks a building, throws another to the sea, and turns to Zapp and Kif.] I will destroy you all. [The monster turns to the crew.] I won't stop until your whole planet is as ugly as you perceived me to be!"
Benderama,Zapp, That will take a very long time.
Benderama,Kif," Oh, God! Stop. Stop."
Benderama,Bender, Ah!
Benderama,Fry, Blunder? You're the only one who's sober. You gotta do somethin'.
Benderama,Bender, Haven't I done enough already?
Benderama,Fry, Please... Stop the monster. Just do that one thing.
Benderama,Bender, Make it zero and you got a deal.
Benderama,Fry, What if I folded the Professor's sweaters for you?
Benderama,Bender, Both of them?! You mean you'll do two things and I only have to do one thing?
Benderama,Fry, Yeah. To save the world.
Benderama,Fry, Sucker.
Benderama,Bender," Legion of Benders, come onto me. We have one thing to do!"
Benderama,Bender duplicates, [in unison] Screw that.
Benderama,Bender," Oh, come on, you lazy jerks. If we all pitch in, we each only have to do one quintillionth of a thing."
Benderama,Bender duplicates, Alright.
Benderama,Bender, Whoa. Big Bender starts right now.
Benderama,Unattractive giant monster," Get a shave, ugly!"
Benderama,Bender," How about some aftershave, dumpy?"
Benderama,Unattractive giant monster, You big bully!
Benderama,Bender, You ugly nerd! Enjoy a nice guggenheim swirley. Let this beatin' be a lesson about never attacking those more handsome than oneself.
Benderama,Unattractive giant monster, All I wanted was to apologise to you people! But now I have to kill you.
Benderama,Bender, How? By makin' me look at you?
Benderama,Unattractive giant monster, No. By makin' you look at... My momma!
Benderama,Bender, Your momma's so ugly!
Benderama,Unattractive giant monster, I told you not to talk about my momma!
Benderama,Male voice," Walk toward the light, Bender."
Benderama,Bender," Aw, man. Do I have to walk?"
Benderama,Fry, [extendedy] No!
Benderama,Unattractive giant monster," [extendedly] No! At last, I'm beautiful."
Benderama,Bender," Yeah, if you're in the grave dust."
Benderama,Fry," Bender, you did it!"
Benderama,Bender," No, [imitating Fry's drunken voice] we did it. [with normal voice] Ladies and gentlemen, if together we were able to defeat this giant space monster, think how also we might defeat the monsters of poverty and disease and unliteracy. In this spirit, I ask my fellow Benders to join me in working diligently to—"
Benderama,Bender duplicate A, Go to hell!
Benderama,Bender duplicate B, Come on. Let's go some place where we don't have to do one quintillionth of a thing all the time.
Benderama,Bender," Well, that was dumb."
Benderama,Fry, Looks like it's full of dig dogs.
Benderama,Amy," Man, we're way drunk. What happened, Professor?"
Benderama,Farnsworth, Something absolutely incredible! The sweaters got folded.
Benderama,Zoidberg, But how?
Benderama,Fry," I didn't do it. Bender, did you learn a lesson about not bein' lazy while the rest of us were bombed out of our gourds?"
Benderama,Bender," Maybe I did, Fry. Maybe I did. Or maybe I rescued one last mini-Bender to fold stupid, ugly sweaters while I laughed at him. [Bender giggles.] I guess we'll never know."
Benderama,,
The Tip of the Zoidberg,,
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Man, Mom on deck! Ten—
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Mom," Alright, grunts. Here's your pre-mission pep talk. [Mom pulls out a gun with her left hand, cocks the gun, turns to the man, and hands the man the gun.] Shoot anyone who doesn't obey hard enough."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Man, But—
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Mom," Stop gaining knowledge, Hubert! [The camera zooms out, revealing Professor Farnsworth to still have hair and be sitting on a crate. Two other crates read CONTENTS  MORE CRATES. Mom takes the book off Professor Farnsworth's hands and grunts as she rips it apart. The man is behind her.] It's a simple mission. [Mom points at the soldiers with her right hand.] The grunts catch the Alien, the surgeon guts it, and you smuggle the poison parts back here."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," Eh, something about poison. Got it. Eh, by the way, that surgeon... [Professor Farnsworth stands up.] Where is he?"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Mom, You! Where's the butcher?!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Man," Ma'am, I dunno, ma'am. 'Is duffel bag arrived."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, [off camera] It's not a duffel bag. It's my apartment.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Mom," Hubert, meet John Zoidberg. [Mom points at Zoidberg with her right hand and then turns to him.] You need an Alien hacked to pieces, he's the best there is. [Mom crosses her arms as she turns to Professor Farnsworth.] In the budget category."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth, [to Zoidberg] Have you ever dissected a Yeti before?
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, [to Professor Farnsworth] Pfff. [Zoidberg lifts up his right claw and looks at it.] Himalayan or Neptunian?
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth, Tritonian.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," A Tritonian Yeti?! [Zoidberg points at Professor Farnsworth with his right claw.] You two aren't up to anything unethical, are you?!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Mom," [calm] Relax. [Mom begins walking away.] There's nothing unethical about covert biological weapons research. [Zoidberg and Professor Farnsworth look at Mom in suspicion. Mom stops walking and turns to Zoidberg and Professor Farnsworth.] [angry, screaming] I said, ""Relax."""
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," Ah, Zoidberg. [Professor Farnsworth pulls a mouse out of his bag and throws it on the floor.] We've known each other so long that... Sometimes, I don't think we even need words to understand each other."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, What?
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Leela," Once and for all, Fry, even though it's the future, most objects are still just objects. Not Aliens who look like objects."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Fry, So my efforts to establish diplomatic relations with the cactus people were doomed from the start.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," So you're in pain and 'ave a bunch o' needles. I prescribe acupuncture. [Zoidberg lifts up a book labelled PRINCIPLES OF ACUPUNCTURE with his right claw.] Let's begin. [Zoidberg hits Fry's right hand with the book. Fry screams.] [scared] Blood?! [casual] I mean, ""Blood."""
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Fry, Put it back in me!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, I'm afraid Fry lost a lotta juice. [Zoidberg points forward with his right claw. Leela turns to that direction.] He's developed Simpsons jaundice.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Fry," ¡Ay, caramba!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, His only hope is some replacement liver. Yours looks like a good match.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Leela," Well, if it'll help Fry—"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Fry," Careful, Leela! [Leela turns to Fry.] He knows less about Human anatomy than I do. And I can't even find my own uterus!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," [over the noise, screaming] You may feel a slight sawing!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, And all we need is a little spine supplement to replace what Leela lost in that unavoidable saw mix-up.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Leela," It wasn't unavoidable! [Leela jumps forward.] You just had to stop cutting my spine when I yelled, ""Stop! You're cutting my spine!"""
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Fry," [off camera] Quit complaining! [The camera pans over to Fry. Fry, whose skin resembles that of Garfield, is sitting on the bed.] My body rejected your liver and now I've got Garfield syndrome. [Fry sighs.] I hate Mondays."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," Anyhow, Hermes, all Leela needs is one of your vertebrae."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Hermes," But, Doctor, will I be able to limbo afterwards?"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," Could you limbo before? [Zoidberg laughs.] Wait. I say, ""Yes."" And you say, ""I couldn't limbo before."" You ruined the joke, Hermes!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," There you go, Leela. Good as new!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Leela, Whoa! Whoa!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Fry," Oh, sure."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Leela, [continued] Whoa!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Fry, [continued] Leela's fine. [Fry points at Leela with his left hand and at himself with both his hands.] But my jaundice has progressed a Muppet gangrene. It's not easy being gangrenous.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Hermes, I thought you were only gonna take out one vertebra!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," Yeah, but did you ever play Jenga? Sometimes, you pull one and—"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Fry," [over the noise] Oh, yeah? Well, I've got news for ya. I'm not stayin' like this. You're the Doctor!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, Hmmm. What started out as a pleasant afternoon of drugs and surgery has not gone as planned. But don't worry. We still 'ave three or four coworkers with plenty of spare parts.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," My first mission. [Zoidberg stops clawing.] I'm so excited. [Zoidberg turns to Professor Farnsworth as the camera zooms out, revealing a black-haired man to be to Professor Farnsworth's left.] And, after I dissect the Yeti's poison glands, we can stop maybe for ice cream on the way back? [Professor Farnsworth turns to Zoidberg and smiles.] With sprinkles on?"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," Why, you're just a big kid, aren't you, Zoidberg?"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, A very big kid.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Man," We're over the drop zone, gentlemen. Might I suggest you jump out the door and poop yourselves."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," So, anyway, I hope the men 'ave been taking their hypermalaria pills."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth, Their wha?!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," ""Their wha?!"" [Zoidberg laughs.] That's funny. Like a crazy, old man. But you know what's not funny? [Zoidberg points at Professor Farnsworth with his right claw.] Deadly Tritonian hypermalaria. Just be sure to stay outta the methane swamps. [Professor Farnsworth and Zoidberg fall in a body of purple water, where six soldiers have already fallen. Zoidberg smells the air.] What smells like methane?"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Doctor, My God. I've never seen such a gruesome shark attack. [Leela's spine is still showing. Hermes' upper body is connected to his lower body by Scruffy's lower body. Scruffy's head is connected to his left hand. Fry's skin resembles that of a Smurf.] Especially this far inland.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Leela," It wasn't a shark. It was an awful, incompetent doctor."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Doctor, Wow. He must've been a total Zoidberg.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Hermes," It was Zoidberg! He brutalised us with power tools, gypsy curses, and hypnosis!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Amy," Yes, master."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Doctor, You'll all get through this. I give you my word as a real doctor.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Bender, What about me?
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Doctor, What did 'e do to you?
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Bender," I dunno exactly, but... [Bender lifts up his T-shirt, revealing himself to be wearing a diaper.] [whispering] I'm incontinent."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Doctor, I'm truly sorry.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Fry, I consider myself a reasonable man. Quick with a joke. Slow to anger. But Bender can't go on long car trips anymore an' I say Zoidberg must die!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Hermes," People, please! [Hermes raises his arms.] Let's not overreact— [Hermes' body parts disconnect and fall on the floor.] Death to the crab!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," How bad is it, Doctor?"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, Super bad. It's Tritonian hypermalaria. [Zoidberg and Professor Farnsworth stop walking.] A lot of these men will be dead within twenty-four hours.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Man, What?!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," Not you, though! [Zoidberg points at the man with his right claw.] You'll make a complete recovery and go on to marry a super model! [The man sighs in relief and lies down. Zoidberg and Professor Farnsworth resume walking.] Funny plague, hypermalaria. [Zoidberg and Professor Farnsworth stop walking.] It can kill immediately. Or lie dormant for decades. But, sooner or later, it erupts, causing fever, spasms, madness, coma, and finally... Death."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Man, What?!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, Super model!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," Oh! [Zoidberg looks at Professor Farnsworth.] Those poor, doomed bastards. I guess it's up to me to complete the mission."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," I'll be in the swamp, blowing the smirk off a toxic Yeti."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Hermes," Professor, we need to talk! [Hermes raises his right fist.] Man-to-mob. [Hermes, Amy, Fry, Leela, Bender, and Scruffy complain.] [over the noise] You need to listen to us! Yes, you do!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Leela, We've had it with Zoidberg! [Leela points at Professor Farnsworth with her right hand and pokes him in the chest three times.] We demand you fire him!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," Nonsense! Zoidberg's a fine physician. [Professor Farnsworth shrugs.] For Aliens. [Professor Farnsworth points at the others with his left hand.] Your mistake is being Humans! No. If I'm going to fire anyone, it'll be Scruffy."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Hermes, [over the noise] Ya can't do that!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Bender, [over the noise] What did Scruffy ever do to you?!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Amy," [angry, screaming] Over my dead body!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Bender," Don't you get it, old man? [Bender lets go of Professor Farnsworth.] Thanks to Dr. Scissor Hands, I wet myself every time I laugh. [Fry chuckles. Bender turns to Fry.] It's not funny! Well... I guess it is kinda funny. [Bender chuckles.] Uh-oh."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Hermes," Why are you protecting Zoidberg, Professor? [Hermes points at Professor Farnsworth with his right hand.] Do you owe him something?"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Leela, Is he blackmailing you somehow?
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Amy, What does 'e have on you?! [Amy shakes Professor Farnsworth.] Why have you kept 'im around all these years when 'e's so grossly incompetent?!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," Long ago, Zoidberg an' I entered into a secret arrangement relating to certain extraordinary events too horrible to reveal. [The camera stops zooming in on Professor Farnsworth.] [angry, screaming] So there's nothing to be curious about!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," [yelling] Stop or I'll shoot! [Professor Farnsworth tries to keep control, but falls to his right knee and stops shooting. We see the dimly lit vastness of the forest and trees with laser-shot holes scattered around. Zoidberg appears crouched with his arms up for cover and steps out of the bushes.] [back to normal, off camera] Zoidberg?!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," You can't hunt a Yeti by yourself, sir. [Professor Farnsworth stands up.] It's suicidal."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," So what?! [Professor Farnsworth raises his arms.] I'm going to die of hypermalaria, anyway. I was in the same swamp as the rest of the men."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," Just because you were in the swamp, doesn't necessarily mean—"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," I was thirsty from the flight! I drank swamp water! Look, Zoidberg. [Professor Farnsworth puts his right hand on Zoidberg's left shoulder.] You're a loyal friend."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, [touched] Friend?!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth, But I'm doomed. [Professor Farnsworth removes his right hand from Zoidberg's left shoulder.] I might as well capture a Yeti and die trying.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, Then you'll need someone to dissect it! [Professor Farnsworth looks back at Zoidberg.] Friend.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," Go, Johnny! Go! [Professor Farnsworth turns back to Zoidberg.] That's an order!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, Never! Zoidberg doesn't abandon a friend apparently.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth, Ooh! Ooh-ho-ho!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, I'll save us! By scaring 'im off with my crazy war noise! [Zoidberg makes a strange sound. The Yeti grabs Zoidberg. Zoidberg screams. The camera pans over to Professor Farnsworth. Professor Farnsworth covers his face with his left hand. The Yeti is crunching Zoidberg's head.] Crunch all you want. I'll make more.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, Oy. [Zoidberg takes off the stethoscope.] I lost another one.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Leela," [off camera] Zoidberg... [The camera pans over to Scruffy, Leela, Hermes, and Fry, who have just entered. Amy and Bender enter. Fry crosses his arms.] [on camera] I'm sorry to break it to you this way, but we hate you and we never wanna see you again."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," But, friends—"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Hermes, We're not your friends! We're your victims!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, I was just trying to—
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Amy, Shut up and give me my kidney back!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, I'm sorry. [Zoidberg pulls a kidney out of his coat with his left claw.] I'm sorry.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Fry, We dunno why the Professor keeps you around here and we don't care! [Zoidberg has removed his face from his hands.] [off camera] You're a terrible doctor! [Hermes has crossed his arms. Fry points at Zoidberg with his right hand three times. Amy puts the kidney in her left pocket with her right hand.] [on camera] Nobody wants to see you ever again!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," Dr. Zoidberg, I want to see you right now!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," The time 'as come, my friend. [Professor Farnsworth walks up to Zoidberg and puts his hands on Zoidberg's shoulders.] We have to talk about... Our arrangement."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," Oh, no! [Professor Farnsworth approaches Zoidberg. Zoidberg shoves what appears to be a television set on the floor and leans against a table.] No! No! [Zoidberg stands up.] Oh, no, no, no! Oh, no!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," Oh, no!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," Unpaw him, you big ape! [Professor Farnsworth grabs a knife from his left boot with his left hand.] I saw this in a Tarzan movie. [Professor Farnsworth jumps at the Yeti.] It was called... [Professor Farnsworth stabs the Yeti. The Yeti grunts.] Tarzan versus the Yetis. [Professor Farnsworth stabs the Yeti. The Yeti grunts.] I lost my virginity... [Professor Farnsworth stabs the Yeti. The Yeti grunts.] Ooh! During the film. So I'm... Hah! [Professor Farnsworth stabs the Yeti. The Yeti grunts.] A little fuzzy on the details. [The Yeti scratches Professor Farnsworth's neck. Professor Farnsworth screams and attempts to stab the Yeti again, but the Yeti, which is holding Zoidberg with its left hand, throws him against the tree.] Oh! [Professor Farnsworth hits the tree, grunts, and falls on the ground. Professor Farnsworth's knife has fallen on the ground as well. Professor Farnsworth stands up and looks at his left hand, which is covered with blood. The Yeti is crunching Zoidberg's head again. Professor Farnsworth, who is holding his knife with his left hand, runs towards the Yeti. The Yeti drops Zoidberg on the ground. Professor Farnsworth jumps at the Yeti. The Yeti falls down. Professor Farnsworth lifts up his head, revealing that he has stabbed the Yeti in the chest and turns to Zoidberg. Zoidberg is rubbing his head. Professor Farnsworth walks up to Zoidberg.] John... [Zoidberg looks at Professor Farnsworth and stops rubbing his head. Professor Farnsworth kneels in front of Zoidberg.] Are you alright?"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, You! [Zoidberg turns to Professor Farnsworth.] You saved my life!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," Oh, fuff."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," Yes, fuff. [Zoidberg stands up.] How can I ever repay you?! Do you need a slave? [Zoidberg shrugs.] Or maybe a butler?"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," No, I haven't needed a butler since grad school. But I do need a doctor. [Professor Farnsworth points at Zoidberg with his left hand.] I don't wanna die like those marines, John. [Professor Farnsworth puts his hands on Zoidberg's shoulders.] The fever! The madness!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," Don't forget the spasms, coma, and death."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth, I don't want to go through that! [Professor Farnsworth turns to Zoidberg and grabs him.] I want you to kill me!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, Alright. [Zoidberg lifts up his left claw.] Give me the knife.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth, Not now! [Professor Farnsworth lets go of Zoidberg and turns back.] Hypermalaria can lie dormant for years. [Professor Farnsworth turns to Zoidberg.] Isn't that what you said?
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, It sounds like something I would say.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth, So stay with me until the symptoms start. Then... [Professor Farnsworth puts his right hand on his chest.] Put me out of my misery. You must swear!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," Alright, Hubert. [Zoidberg puts his right claw on Professor Farnsworth's right arm and smiles.] I swear."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," It's started, Zoidberg. The fever. The muscle spasms. [Professor Farnsworth slaps himself twice with each hand.] I'm dying. [Professor Farnsworth coughs aggressively.] It's time for you to keep your promise and kill me."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, This is very difficult. [Zoidberg opens his eyes.] But I'll try... [Zoidberg turns to Professor Farnsworth.] Friend.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth, No! Wait! [Professor Farnsworth puts his hands on Zoidberg's arms.] I'm afraid to die!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," Argh! [Zoidberg's fin disappears.] You said you wanted me to kill you! [Zoidberg points at Professor Farnsworth with his right claw.] Is this one o' those ""No means yes"" deals?!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth, Yes and no. [Professor Farnsworth stands up and points at Zoidberg with his left hand.] I do want you to kill me. But I mustn't see it coming. That would be agony! [Professor Farnsworth walks up to Zoidberg.] So you must murder me completely by surprise.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," As God is my witness, you can count on me. [Zoidberg points at himself with his right claw twice.] Well... See you tomorrow."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth, Not surprising enough!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," Eh, wha?! Oh! [Professor Farnsworth screams effeminately and puts his right hand on his chest.] My... [Zoidberg stops approaching Professor Farnsworth. Professor Farnsworth grunts.] Heart!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Fry, Hey!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Leela, What are you doing there?
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth, Whoa! [Zoidberg grabs Professor Farnsworth's coat.] Whoa! [Leela runs on top of the conference table. Fry runs on the floor.] Whoa! [Leela grabs Zoidberg. Zoidberg is holding Professor Farnsworth's coat. Professor Farnsworth has fallen. Fry grabs the remote control. The song stops playing. Fry makes the remote-controlled airplane fly by Professor Farnsworth.] Whoa!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, Stop! You don't understand!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Leela," Let's go, you murderer! Fry, help me lock 'im up!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Fry, Hang on. I'm learnin' how to do loop-de-loops.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth, Whoa! Whoa! Woo!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, You're making a mistake! I was only trying to kill the Professor!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Bender, Ooh.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, Hubert... I'm sorry. [Zoidberg grabs a lock of white hair from the coat.] Wha?! He doesn't have hair. [Zoidberg puts the lock of white hair on a microscope and looks inside it with his left eye.] Great Little Caesar's ghost!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," You fools! [Professor Farnsworth takes the towel off his head and turns to his left.] You stupid, life-prolonging fools! [Hermes, Leela, Fry, Bender, and Amy are also present. Fry has crossed his arms.] I asked Zoidberg to kill me!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Amy, Huh?!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Bender," What you talkin' 'bout, Professor?!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Hermes," Professor, have you gone mad?!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth, Probably! [Professor Farnsworth puts the towel back on his head.] It's one o' the symptoms of Tritonian hypermalaria!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Amy," You mean the incurable disease that causes fever... [Professor Farnsworth squeezes the towel, making a pool on the floor.] Spasms... [Professor Farnsworth punches himself with his right hand, dropping the towel on the floor, punches himself with his left hand, and slaps himself with his right hand.] Insanity... [Professor Farnsworth looks up, laughs maniacally, and kicks the pool four times with his right foot and five times with his left foot.] Coma... [Professor Farnsworth falls over.] And finally death?!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," Yes! And I begged Zoidberg to put me out of my misery! [Professor Farnsworth points at the door with his right hand.] Bring 'im! [Professor Farnsworth violently hits his chin with his right knee, grunts, puts his hands on his chin, and leans back in his chair.] Quickly!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Scruffy, Hmmm. Should've known better than to store my antiques in the office.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Leela," Zoidberg, we were wrong! [The door opens.] We're letting you out so you can kill the Professor!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, [quickly] Woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Amy," Oh, no! [Amy turns to her left.] He sand-crabbed out!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Leela, Then we have no choice. We'll have to mercy-kill the Professor ourselves.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Bender," Well, let's get started."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Walt," We have a situation, Mother. This creature tried to sand-crab into the building."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Mom, Zoidberg?!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," Sorry I didn't call first, Carol. Uh... But I'm in a hurry! I need your help to save Hubert!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Mom," [to the two men] Let him go [to Larry, Walt, and Igner] and stooge the hell out of here!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Larry, We're on it.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Walt, Ow!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Igner, Ow!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Larry, Ow!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, Beautiful kids. You must be very proud!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Mom, John Zoidberg... It's been a long time. How've you been?
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," Not too bad. [Zoidberg sits down.] Last year, I took a bus trip to the Grand Canyon. [Zoidberg points at Mom with his right claw.] Later, I'll show you the pictures."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Mom," Do you ever regret it, John? [Mom walks up to Zoidberg and leans over him.] Leaving me to work for the Professor?"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, What do you want me to say? [Zoidberg shrugs.] 'E saved my life.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Mom," Oh, big deal! You could've been rich if you'd stayed. [Mom points at Zoidberg with her left hand.] Your own lab... A full staff..."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, But Hubert is my friend. [Zoidberg closes his eyes.] 'E's very sick. [Zoidberg opens his eyes and points at himself with his left claw.] I can cure him. But I need the thing! The thing... [The camera zooms in on Zoidberg's face.] From Triton!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Mom," It'll cost you, John. [Mom turns to her left and lifts up her right hand.] How much are you worth now?"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, I live in a dumpster. [Zoidberg pulls a piece of paper out of his coat with his right claw.] All I have in the world is this coupon for one free session at the tanning salon.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Mom," [sad] Oh, John. [Mom points at Zoidberg with her left hand.] That's really all you have? [Zoidberg nods.] [happy] Then I'll take it."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Scruffy, Okay. [Scruffy lifts up the welding mask.] Murdolator's finished.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Bender, I said I'd kill 'im myself! [Bender raises his arms and then crosses them.] Nobody listens to Bender!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Leela, We all have to share in the guilt. [Leela turns to Bender.] Which is why we're each going to add one drop of cyanide to the death wheel as it goes by.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Scruffy, Commence mercy-killing... [Scruffy is wearing a cloth with holes for eyes on his head.] In three... [Scruffy lifts up a small flag with his left hand.] Two... [Scruffy pulls down the small flag.] Ayup.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Hermes, Kill-check one is go!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Leela, [off camera] Yay!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Amy, [off camera] Woohoo!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Fry, Kill-check two is go!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Humans, Ooh!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Woman, Wow!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Hattie, It's about time.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Female voice, Vegetables activated.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Bender," Kill-check three is go! Also, the salad's ready."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Leela," Yay, salad!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Amy, Yay!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, [off camera] What the hell are you doing?!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Leela," [off camera] Zoidberg! [Leela descends through the elevator and runs towards Zoidberg.] [on camera] We know about your secret agreement. [Leela points at herself with both her hands.] I am so, so sorry for how we treated you."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Fry," And, to make it up to you, we're killing the Professor for you so he doesn't die horribly from hypermalaria."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," 'E doesn't have hypermalaria, you idiots! [We hear a growling sound. The camera zooms out, revealing Scruffy and Professor Farnsworth. Professor Farnsworth, who has grown white hair, sits up as he growls.] 'E has Yetiism. [Leela, Fry, Bender, Amy, and Hermes gasp. Zoidberg walks up to the bed.] When 'e saved my life all those years ago, 'e was scratched by a Yeti!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Fry, Hmmm. I consider myself almost completely ignorant of modern medicine. [Fry points at the Professor Farnsworth Yeti with his left hand.] And I've never heard of Yetiism.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," It mimics the symptoms of hypermalaria exactly. [The Professor Farnsworth Yeti lies down.] Except for the part where, instead of dying, you turn into a Yeti! [The wheel approaches Zoidberg. Zoidberg avoids the wheel and makes a strange sound. The wheel lands next to a set of logs, above which is a kettle, and its flaming tube burns it. The camera zooms in on the kettle. The water in the kettle begins evaporating.] Wow! [The Professor Farnsworth Yeti begins screaming.] Hold 'im down while I prepare the antidote."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Leela, Another Yeti?!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," Yes. [Zoidberg looks at the Yeti's head.] The same jerk that once noshed on me like a shrimp toast. [Zoidberg pulls a giant bolt out of his right pocket with his right claw.] Now, who's getting 'is pineal gland extracted? [Zoidberg grunts as he extracts a gland from the Yeti's head.] Ah, yes. [Zoidberg holds up the gland.] This contains a concentrated form of the Yeti neurotoxin."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Hermes, But that's what gave 'im Yetiism in the first place! Won't it just make 'im a double Yeti?!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," Don't lecture me about Alien physiology, Conrad! The pineal neurotoxin neutralises the adrenal neurotoxin. That's why Yetis don't drive themselves mad!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Fry, My God. He's like some kinda believable Hulk!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," No time for an injection. [Zoidberg grabs the gland with his mouth hand, throws the giant bolt away, climbs the Professor Farnsworth Yeti, holds its head with his claws, opens its mouth with two of his mouth fingers, and spits the gland into it. The Professor Farnsworth Yeti closes its mouth, swallows the gland, and throws Zoidberg away with its left hand.] Uh! [Zoidberg hits the wall, makes a strange sound, falls on the floor, and grunts. The Professor Farnsworth Yeti grows in size.] [off camera] I'll be damned. It did make 'im a double Yeti!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Amy, [sad] It wasn't supposed to do any of those things.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," You did it, Johnny. I'm cured!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Bender," Wow! [Professor Farnsworth begins getting off the remains. Zoidberg and Professor Farnsworth hug. The camera zooms out, revealing Hermes, Leela, Fry, Amy, Bender, and Scruffy. Bender turns to the others.] Alright, let's set it up and try again."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," There's one thing I don't understand, Zoidberg. [Leela, Bender, Amy, and Zoidberg are also present. Amy is sitting on the couch's right arm.] How did you persuade Mom to give you her precious Yeti head? Did you 'ave to promise anything in return?"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, [sad] Nothing. Nothing at all.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Amy," This calls for a celebration! Come on, everyone! [Amy stands up.] Let's go tanning!"
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Bender, Hooray!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth, Yay!
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg, [sad] I was going to tan... [Zoidberg looks down.] Once.
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth," What do you say, Johnny? [Professor Farnsworth approaches the door.] It's on me."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Zoidberg," [comforted] Thank you, Hubert."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,Farnsworth and Zoidberg," [quickly, in unison] Woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop."
The Tip of the Zoidberg,,
Ghost in the Machines,,
Ghost in the Machines,Hermes," Listen up, people."
Ghost in the Machines,Hermes," As long as nothing happens for the next fifteen minutes, our insurance will be reinstated, so let's just sit quietly and run out the clock."
Ghost in the Machines,Amy, A giant sausage!
Ghost in the Machines,Bender," Oh, God!"
Ghost in the Machines,Hermes," Oh, God, no! Get out of here, you horrific sausage!"
Ghost in the Machines,Leela, Wait! Isn't today the parade? It's just a giant balloon!
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, Giant balloon?
Ghost in the Machines,Bender," See, buddy? It's not so scary."
Ghost in the Machines,Fry," I feel better now. [The parade continues. Two men dressed in green are holding a sign reading St. Patrick's Day Parade, a dragon is sustaining a sign reading CHINESE NEW YEAR PARADE, six blue Aliens are circling the road in their spaceships, and Bender is still carrying Fry on his back.] Why is so many different parades smooshed together?"
Ghost in the Machines,Leela, It's the Parade Day parade.
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, What's Parade Day?
Ghost in the Machines,Farnsworth," It used to be that every group in New New York wanted their own parade. Why, when I was a boy, we had a parade every day. Those were dark times."
Ghost in the Machines,Leela, Now we just combine them all into one big Parade Day parade and get it over with.
Ghost in the Machines,Zoidberg," Hey, look! A fog is rolling in."
Ghost in the Machines,Hermes," No, that's just the Jamaican pride float."
Ghost in the Machines,Amy, Looks like it's speeding up.
Ghost in the Machines,Hermes," Oh, no! It's within munching distance of the Doritos float."
Ghost in the Machines,Zapp," Thank you! Thank you! [to the floor] Kif, you're slacking off of my waving arm."
Ghost in the Machines,Leela," Oh, no! It's heading right for those two nerds!"
Ghost in the Machines,Manbot," Whoa! Sweet shirt, dude!"
Ghost in the Machines,Man, Thanks. I have another one that says PALEONTOLOGISTS DO IT IN THE DIRT. I'm a palaeontologist.
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, [in slow motion] I'll save one of you!
Ghost in the Machines,Woman," Oh, honey! I dig you so much! [to Fry] Thank you for saving my stupidly dressed husband. [The woman laughs.] You're a hero!"
Ghost in the Machines,Mayor Poopenmeyer," A hero indeed. What's your name, son?"
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, I dunno. Fry?
Ghost in the Machines,Mayor Poopenmeyer," Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to associate myself with a true hero. [The crowd cheers.] Mr. Fry, allow me to present you with the keys to the city. [The Mayor rummages through the keys.] This one's for the deadbolt, this is for the top lock... I think this one's for the knob. The city's in a bad neighbourhood. [The Mayor laughs.] Care to say a few words, son?"
Ghost in the Machines,Fry," Uh... Heroes don't do drugs! Except for Drugman, I guess."
Ghost in the Machines,Mayor Poopenmeyer, I hereby declare that henceforth this Saturday shall be known as Fry-day!
Ghost in the Machines,Fry," It sure was nice of the Mayor's wife to have sex with me. [Fry sees something before him, stops, and blinks.] Huh?"
Ghost in the Machines,Bender, You!
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, What?
Ghost in the Machines,Bender," You could've saved the Robot, but instead you saved the Human. [Bender crosses his arms.] Do you think Human life is more precious than Robot life?"
Ghost in the Machines,Fry," No, no... Well, yes, actually."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender, That's it. I'm killin' myself!
Ghost in the Machines,Leela," Oh, Lord."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender, Don't try and talk me out of it! [They do not say anything and Bender turns his head towards them.] Well?
Ghost in the Machines,Amy," Bender, you always say you're gonna kill yourself, but you almost never do."
Ghost in the Machines,Hermes," Yeah. Last time you went to the suicide booth, you ended up dating it for six months."
Ghost in the Machines,Leela," How is Lynn, by the way?"
Ghost in the Machines,Bender," Livin' in Oregon with her crazy mother! See you at my funeral, suckers!"
Ghost in the Machines,Bender," Kill me, please! [Bender puts the stringed coin into his chest cabinet.] And make it splatter!"
Ghost in the Machines,Suicide booth, With pleasure... Bender!
Ghost in the Machines,Bender," Lynn? [Bender gasps.] Huh, wow, you look great. [Bender laughs nervously.] Fat, but great. I thought you were in Oregon."
Ghost in the Machines,Suicide booth, My mom tried to commit suicide in me. I don't wanna talk about it.
Ghost in the Machines,Bender," Well, tell your mom I said hello and it's been nice catchin' up with you. Let's get this show on the road!"
Ghost in the Machines,Suicide booth," Oh, no! You're going to die, alright. But it won't be suicide. It'll be murder!"
Ghost in the Machines,Bender, [off camera] Missed me!
Ghost in the Machines,Fry," He did it. [Fry walks up to the conference table, where Amy, Leela, Professor Farnsworth, Zoidberg, and Hermes are sitting. He lays Bender's body on the table.] He actually did it this time."
Ghost in the Machines,Hermes," No way, mon. He's fakin' it. [Hermes grabs a $1 bill and waves it over Bender's head. Bender doesn't react. Hermes gasps.] He really is gone. [Hermes stands up.] Everyone, put on your takin'-off caps."
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, Our what?
Ghost in the Machines,Farnsworth," It's a sign of respect, you savage!"
Ghost in the Machines,Amy," Poor, nasty, mean, old Bender. I can't believe we'll never hear his evil laugh again."
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, I miss 'im so much.
Ghost in the Machines,Hermes," There, there, Fry. He may be gone, but he'll always be with us as a trash can."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," Look at that loser gettin' garbage dumped in 'im. Glad I'm not him, whoever he is."
Ghost in the Machines,Leela," Fry, as his only friend, you should have first pick of body parts."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," Just don't pick his nose! [Bender's ghost laughs, but the others do not.] What's wrong with you guys? This is comedy gold!"
Ghost in the Machines,Fry," He always had my back, so I'll take his arm, uh... As a backscratcher. [Fry struggles to rip off Bender's arm.] I love you, Bender. Somebody hand me a bolt cutter."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," Hey, dipshlits! That's not me. I'm right here. Hello! [Bender's ghost pulls out a megaphone from his chest cabinet.] Pay attention to me!"
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, Why can't anybody hear my witty remarks? This is Hell!
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil, Feh! You wish!
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, Robot Devil? You can hear me? Why is everyone else ignoring me?
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil," Isn't it obvious, Bender?"
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," Yeah, I guess it is."
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil, You're dead!
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, What?! I thought I just had laryngitis and anti-gravity.
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil, Come down to my office and I'll explain everything.
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, So what's happenin' to me? And I'll take my answer in any form but a song!
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil," Oh, you're no fun. [The Robot Devil snaps his fingers and the ship, which is revealed to be a background, is removed by two Robot Demons.] You see, Bender, it's simple. You're a ghost!"
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, A g-g-g-g-ghost?!
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil," No, just the regular kind. [The Robot Devil lights his hand as if it were a cigarette and begins smoking it.] Because you killed yourself, you're in Limbo. Your software was exported to the computational cloud."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," Adoy! Wait, Adoy?"
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil, Your disembodied programme is now running on the wireless network shared by all machinery.
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," Cut to the chase, Smokey! How do I get outta Limbo?"
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil, That's the laughy part! You can't! You're stuck in an infinite loop.
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," An infinite loop? [Bender's ghost waves away the smoke.] I don't have time for that. Man, this is all Fry's fault!"
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil, Fry? I hate that guy. We once traded hands. [The Robot Devil smells his hands.] They still stink of candy corn!
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, Get this  That jerk said Human life was more valuable than Robot life!
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil," What?! [The Robot Devil jumps onto his desk and flames rise up behind him.] After all you've done for him, Fry must die."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," I know, right? I'd murder him good if only I was still alive."
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil," Bender, would you like to make a deal?"
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," I'm not stupid... [Bender's ghost crosses his arms.] So yes, absolutely. [Bender's ghost grabs the pen and signs the contract.] What have I agreed to?"
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil, I'll return you to your body... After you use your ghostly powers to scare Fry to death!
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, That sounds fair and also fun. I like that there's no catch this time.
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil, But wait. There's a catch.
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, Crap!
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil," If you fail, you'll spend eternity here in Robot Hell. Which, as luck would have it, is where I rehearse my band. [to the Robot Demons] Hit it, boys! [The Robot Demons begin playing. The first Demon is at the piano, the second is at the drums, which bear the Devil's face, and the third is at the trumpet.] [singing] Cigars are evil. You won't miss 'em—"
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," Okay! I'll do it, I'll do it. Just stop the damn music!"
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," Scare Fry to death? Ha. I could do that in my sleep. [Bender's ghost woos, but Fry does not react.] What are you, deaf?"
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," Soap. I know Fry's afraid of that. [Bender's ghost rubs his hands.] Maybe he'll die if I rub 'im all over with it real slow. [Bender's ghost grunts as he tries to grab the soap, never succeeding. He is accidentally absorbed into a hair dryer. The hair dryer powers up.] Whoa, it's sick! My software can control electronics."
Ghost in the Machines,Fry," What the— [Bender's ghost flies into Fry's toothbrush. It, too, attacks Fry. Fry screams as he attempts to free himself from the toothbrush. Bender's ghost flies into a razor, turns it on, and starts flying around Fry.] No! Not the armpits! Winter's coming!"
Ghost in the Machines,Hermes," As you can see, since Bender's death, requests to bite one's shiny metal ass are down 98%. [Scruffy starts vacuum-cleaning with Bender's compartment, leg, and footcup. The crew looks at him.] Do you mind doing that later?!"
Ghost in the Machines,Scruffy, Bite my shiny metal ass.
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, Help! I was attacked in my bathroom! By my bathroom! I'm being haunted by a ghost!
Ghost in the Machines,Amy," Fry... You're just upset because you drove Bender to suicide. Here, take your mind off it with these soothing relaxation balls."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, Alright. I got 'im all heebie-jeebied with my bathroom harass. [Bender's ghost rubs his hands.] One more good scare and I'll be outta Limbo!
Ghost in the Machines,Hermes, Did someone say Limbo?
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, Hold on to your dookie. It's about to get spooky.
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, I'm tellin' ya. Somethin' supernatural is happening. I'm scared to death!
Ghost in the Machines,Leela, Stop being ridiculous. There's no such thing as whatever you're saying.
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, [as he is slapped] Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ghost in the Machines,Leela, Whoa. Maybe you're right. I only meant to slap you twice.
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, All I know is I've got a ghost that needs busting.
Ghost in the Machines,Hermes, Who you gonna call?
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, Gho—
Ghost in the Machines,Female voice, The number you have dialled has been lame since 1989.
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, Now do you believe me?!
Ghost in the Machines,Farnsworth," Oh, fuff. [Professor Farnsworth stands up.] Enough of your superstitious nonsense. I'm sure that whatever is happening can be explained by science."
Ghost in the Machines,Gypsy, Let the séance begin!
Ghost in the Machines,Farnsworth, I said science!
Ghost in the Machines,Gypsy, The veil is lifting. I am gazing into the spirit world... And... Nothing. [to Fry] You said something about a buffet?
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," I'm right here, you lazy shyster!"
Ghost in the Machines,Gypsy," [calmly, as she is attacked] Wait. I'm sensing something."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," I'm rich! [Bender's ghost makes sounds of excitement, but realises that he cannot reach the coins.] Aw."
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, [to the gypsy] Is it a ghost?!
Ghost in the Machines,Gypsy," There's no such thing as ghosts, you donkey monkey! It's a Robot ghost."
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, A Robot ghost?! What Robot would wanna haunt me?
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," Me, dumbass! Bender, Bender, Bender, Bender! [Fry scratches his back with Bender's arm.] Aw! [to the gypsy] Tell 'im, you baggy, old crone!"
Ghost in the Machines,Farnsworth, Finally! Any more ridiculous ideas?
Ghost in the Machines,Reverend Preacherbot," Hallelujah! [Reverend Preacherbot stands in front of the door and it is opened by Leela.] I'm here to conduct a exorcism and avail myself of the buffet. [Reverend Preacherbot takes his hat off, gives it to Leela, and enters.] Can I get an amen and a goodly helpin' of Scruffy's famous corn biscuits?"
Ghost in the Machines,Scruffy," Right away, Reverend."
Ghost in the Machines,Reverend Preacherbot," Oh, Lord. I got the too much macaroni sweats. Now where's this alleged apparition? [Reverend Preacherbot screams after seeing several machines flying around Fry, who is sitting on the floor, helpless. The machines are being controlled by Bender's ghost.] Might be a problem with your circuit breaker. See ya."
Ghost in the Machines,Fry," Please! I'm under constant attack by machinery. I can't sleep, I can't think. I can't even think!"
Ghost in the Machines,Reverend Preacherbot," Very well. [Reverend Preacherbot puts a box on the floor, opens it, and grabs an object consisting of a parallelepiped and a pyramid.] This sacramental firewall scans for and removes ghostware in a twenty-foot radius."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," Bring it on, holy man!"
Ghost in the Machines,Reverend Preacherbot, Carry this at all times and the demon cannot harm you. It also keeps cats off the sofa. By killin' 'em!
Ghost in the Machines,Fry," So quiet! So peaceful! Time to lower my guard even for a minute. [Fry throws the firewall onto the bed. It projects a holographic image of his face that melts down into a skull and he screams. Fry's heart is now beating noticeably fast and Fry begins to faint.] A heart attack! [Fry's heart stops beating.] Yup, I was right."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," Okay, Beelze. Fry's dead."
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil," A ghost! [Bender's ghost approaches the Robot Devil.] Oh, it's you."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," A deal's a deal, so give me my body back."
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil," Fry's dead, you say? Funny. That's not what it says on his Wikipedia page."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," Survived the heart attack?! Damn you, Obamacare!"
Ghost in the Machines,Dr. Cahill," I'm afraid your heart has suffered a lot of damage, Mr. Fry. And my cleavage isn't helping."
Ghost in the Machines,Farnsworth, [smiling] Not helping him.
Ghost in the Machines,Dr. Cahill, One more sudden shock will kill you.
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, Sudden? That's just the kind of one more shock I was plannin'.
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, The machines. They're after me!
Ghost in the Machines,Dr. Cahill," You're suffering from machine phobia. Your only hope is to go to the Amish homeworld, where no machines are allowed."
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, I guess it's for the best. [Bender's ghost's head emerges from the heart monitor and woos.] The only machine I'll ever miss is... [Fry whimpers.] Bender.
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, Say what?
Ghost in the Machines,Fry," Now that he's gone, I realise how valuable a Robot life can be... When it belongs to my best friend."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, [touched] That's the closest thing to Bender is great that anyone besides me has ever said.
Ghost in the Machines,Female voice," Final boarding call for Flight 38 to the Amish homeworld. As a reminder, passengers are limited to two carry-on butter churns."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," I'm sorry, Fry. I'm sorry! Wait for your ghost buddy!"
Ghost in the Machines,Amish man," Brother Fry, thou hast visitors."
Ghost in the Machines,Fry," Well, yank my beard. This be a surprise."
Ghost in the Machines,Leela," How are you, Fry?"
Ghost in the Machines,Fry," Thank you for asking, English. My life is simple, but plain. And, though Bender be gone, somehow, I feel he's still with me."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," I sure am, Brother Fry. [The mysterious-looking lady approaches Bender's ghost.] Yo, big bonnet! Move your ugly but modest head covering. Oh, right. You can't hear me."
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil," Oh, I hear you loud and clear."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, You're not Granny Hester! What have you done with Granny Hester?!
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil," She's naked, but unharmed. And now, Bender, it's time to fulfil your end of the deal."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, Sorry. I'm not gonna kill Fry. Take me to Hell for all eternity. Just as long as my little bearded meatbag gets to live.
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil," That he will not! For, you see, it is your fate to kill him."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, Says you! [The two oxen bellow.] I would never kill Fry! Not even to save my own life!
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil," But, Bender, isn't a Robot life worth ever so much more than a Human life?"
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, Of course not! What idiot thinks that?!
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil, You!
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, You're usin' my own words against me! [screaming] Go to Hell!
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil," Soon enough. But, first, the killing. Have you noticed that animals are sometimes spooked by Robot ghosts?"
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," So what?! I hate animals! [Bender's ghost scares the oxen once again, causing them to bellow angrily and run away with the carriage. The carriage gone, the barn begins rolling down the hill towards the crew. The Robot Devil laughs evilly. Bender's ghost gasps.] Run for your life, Fry! Move your hemp flaps!"
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil," He can't hear you, Bender. I'm afraid your friend is about to be Fully Buckminstered!"
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," Oh, yeah? I'll just jump into a machine and get his attention that way."
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil," Ah, but there aren't any machines on this planet!"
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," There's one, you rusty, old dummy."
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil," Hey, no fair! Ocupado!"
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," [in the Robot Devil's body] Got you! Get over here, Devil!"
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, And Scruffy's buffet? How's that going?
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, [in the Robot Devil's body] Fry! Fry! Look out for that bowlin' barn!
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, Bender?! Is that thou?
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," [in the Robot Devil's body, in slow motion] I love you!"
Ghost in the Machines,Amy," Oh, my God! That was close!"
Ghost in the Machines,Hermes, Did you see that?
Ghost in the Machines,Leela, Are you okay? What just happened?
Ghost in the Machines,Fry," Well, I think the Robot Devil said he'd loved me in Bender's voice, wearing Granny Hester's clothes. I wanna go home!"
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil's ghost," You still lose, Bender. You failed to kill Fry, so you are banished to Hell. [They arrive at the office. The Robot Devil opens a closet with four Devil bodies and flies into one.] I get a new body and you get to be a translucid chump 'til the end of time!"
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," Big deal! I saved my friend. As far as I'm concerned, I won."
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil," Uh, really? [The Robot Demons start playing.] [singing] You may find your victory pyrrhic, when subjected to this lyric, for a trillion years or so. Yeah!"
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, Whoa!
Ghost in the Machines,Robot Devil," Hey, where are you going?!"
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, I don't know and I don't care!
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," Yeah, I'm back! [Bender's ghost continues being pulled upward.] Wait. This is my stop! [Bender's ghost ascends through a cloud, reaching a gate with the letters R and H. The gate opens. Bender's ghost enters and spots a white Robot resembling Robot 1-X.] Oh, this guy..."
Ghost in the Machines,White Robot," Bender, for your selfless act in saving Fry, I am pleased to welcome you to Robot Heaven."
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost," Shut up, God!"
Ghost in the Machines,White Robot, Beg pardon?
Ghost in the Machines,Bender's ghost, I wanna go back to Robot Earth. I mean regular Earth.
Ghost in the Machines,White Robot," Hey, what are you— [Bender's ghost's arms emerge from the white Robot's sides and punch him.] Ow! Hey, stop that! I command you, you jerk! [The white Robot sighs.] Just get out."
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, Woo! I've been through the adventure of a lifetime. [Fry is slapped by Bender's arm.] Ow!
Ghost in the Machines,Bender," I'm back, baby!"
Ghost in the Machines,Fry, You're back from the dead?!
Ghost in the Machines,Bender, I'm back from lots of stuff.
Ghost in the Machines,Fry," Oh, Bender, Bender, I missed you so much! [Fry lets go.] Hey, wait. Did you haunt me?"
Ghost in the Machines,,
Neutopia,Hermes," Well, we're bankrupt in six, five..."
Neutopia,Hermes," Four, three..."
Neutopia,Hermes," Two, one. And we're out of business."
Neutopia,Farnsworth, Good news! We're back in business. We've been hired to deliver an envelope.
Neutopia,Leela," It's crunch time. Let's do this. [The Professors gives Amy, who is in a Robotic suit, the envolope, Amy gives it to Leela, and Leela sighs.] It's for you, Professor."
Neutopia,Farnsworth," Great delivery, everyone. You're the finest crew I've had the honour to work with. [The Professor opens the envelope.] Oh, my. We're being foreclosed upon. You're all terrible and incompetent!"
Neutopia,Amy, I resent that!
Neutopia,Hermes," Wait. I found a loophole in the mortgage. If we actually pay it, we can keep the building. We just need... [Hermes turns the page.] Eleven million dollars."
Neutopia,Bender, And... Boned!
Neutopia,Farnsworth," Aw. I suppose there's nothing left to do but move out. Leela, Amy, pack us a lunch for our new lives under the bridge while us men reminisce and smoke some stogies."
Neutopia,Leela," We are not packing lunches, you walking beer commercials. It was you men who drove this company into the ground. Remember Fry's idea to offer free delivery?"
Neutopia,Fry, It got us a lot of customers!
Neutopia,Leela, We're a delivery company!
Neutopia,Amy," If you wanna save this company, you should listen to a woman's idea for once."
Neutopia,Hermes, Okay. What you got?
Neutopia,Leela, An airline!
Neutopia,Amy," Yeah! Wait, what?"
Neutopia,Leela," We should become a commercial airline. I mean, we've got a ship, and teleporters won't be invented for another fifteen years, according to that guy from the future."
Neutopia,Amy, Wow! That's actually a really good idea for a woman!
Neutopia,Farnsworth, Puff! What else you ladies got?
Neutopia,Bender, [with a female voice] Girls-of-Planet-Express calendar!
Neutopia,Fry," Girly calendar? Great idea, Amy!"
Neutopia,Hermes," Okay, then. Leela, Amy, come to work topless tomorrow."
Neutopia,Leela, Forget it! I promised myself I wouldn't pose naked until I was married.
Neutopia,Hermes," Sorry. It's in your contract. ""All female employees must pose nude if requested."""
Neutopia,Leela, That's discriminatory!
Neutopia,Hermes," No, it's in all our contracts. Here's mine. ""All female employees must pose nude if requested."""
Neutopia,Fry, Sounds fun.
Neutopia,Bender," Back to work, Hermes!"
Neutopia,Scruffy, Now that's what I call fine print.
Neutopia,Amy," Okay, but good luck making a girly calendar with only two female employees."
Neutopia,LaBarbara," Oh, husband! I'm so excited about this new job."
Neutopia,Hermes," And it's excited about you, LaBarbara. First order of business is to put on your uniform and take your ID photo."
Neutopia,Leela," Look, I agree that it makes space walking more comfortable, but, for a photo shoot, it's a little... Unsavoury. Over."
Neutopia,Bender," Time is money, peaches. Now shut your com link and make love to the camera. And remember  I'm the camera. [Leela is photographed on top of the ship, LaBarbara, inside a bathtub filled with packages, and Amy, on the conference table with a holographic Saturn. The three girls are then protographed at the same time, scrubbing the ship.] Stop actually washin' and play with the sponges!"
Neutopia,Leela, But the ship is dirty.
Neutopia,Bender," Uh, whatever. I ran out of film an hour ago."
Neutopia,Farnsworth," No, no. This won't do. A three-month calendar? What is this, Mercury?"
Neutopia,Amy, I told you it wouldn't work.
Neutopia,Farnsworth," Well, you should've talked louder. Fortunately, I came up with a brilliant idea to save Planet Express. We'll turn it into a commercial airline!"
Neutopia,Leela, But that was my idea!
Neutopia,Farnsworth, Then you should've talked louder. [Nothing is said.] What?
Neutopia,Leela," There. It was hard work, but it beats posing in demeaning, skimpy modelling outfits."
Neutopia,Farnsworth," Ladies, here are your demeaning, skimpy stewardess outfits."
Neutopia,Bender," Sorry, ma'am. I'll have to confiscate your artificial knee cap."
Neutopia,Hattie," Okay, here you go."
Neutopia,Fry," Ladies and gentlemen, this is the plane's president speaking."
Neutopia,Fry, We are cleared for takeoff.
Neutopia,Leela, You put Goofus and Ganja in charge? I'm the only trained pilot here.
Neutopia,Farnsworth," Please, Leela. Who ever heard of a plane with a woman president?"
Neutopia,Bender," Welcome to Plan Am Flight 1 to Acapulsar. The local time on Acapulsar is five years from now. [Victor sets his clock from 3011 to 3016.] In the event of a wormhole sendin' us back in time, do not kill your parents. If you who are travelling with small children, help them not to kill you before not killin' your own parents. Now please turn off all electronic devices."
Neutopia,Fry," Uh, preparing for takeoff."
Neutopia,Man," I kill you, my friend!"
Neutopia,LaBarbara, [into a speaker] I hope you all enjoyed our timey beverage service. [Petunia waves. Her seat is filled with bottles.] Now sit back and endure our in-flight entertainment.
Neutopia,Zoidberg," [quickly] Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! [with a normal speed] So what's the deal with airline food, hmm? They offer you two choices, but they're always outta one. Uh, by the way, we're outta both choices."
Neutopia,Petunia, Shut up and put on four episodes of Da Office.
Neutopia,Amana," Ooh, your hands are warm... [Bender grabs a bottle of Olde Fortran.] For a Robot."
Neutopia,Bender," Thanks, baby. I don't know what you're doing back here in the galley, 'cause you got a first-class C."
Neutopia,Leela," Captain, we were supposed to land two days ago. Is everything— Hey!"
Neutopia,Fry," Are we at the fair yet, Mommy?"
Neutopia,Leela, We're not at the any place! And we're out of fuel!
Neutopia,Amy," Attention, passengers. Please remain seated until the plane comes to a complete crash."
Neutopia,Farnsworth, Perhaps we should reconsider the girly calendar.
Neutopia,Leela," Flight-attendance log. We've crashed near a river of mercury on a lifeless, mineral world. Supplies are low. Cannibalism, imminent. Radio, busted. Our one hope is to form a society."
Neutopia,Hermes," Okay, then. Men, let's get hunting. The women folk can cook what we catch."
Neutopia,LaBarbara," No one put you in charge, husband. I'm the only one here who ever ran a society."
Neutopia,Hermes, Roller derby is not a society!
Neutopia,LaBarbara," Well, let's put it to a vote, then. All in favour of the jamooca thunderclap? [All except LaBarbara are confused and looking around.] That would be me."
Neutopia,Hermes, Practically no one. All in favour of me?
Neutopia,Dr. Cahill, Eight to eight. It's a tie.
Neutopia,Farnsworth, We can't trust a woman's math! Count again!
Neutopia,Big rock Alien," Greetings, soft ones. Who among you is your leader?"
Neutopia,Men, He is!
Neutopia,Women, She is!
Neutopia,Big rock Alien, Curious. You're a diarchic society?
Neutopia,Hermes," Um, maybe. But, whatever we are, I'm the leader of it."
Neutopia,LaBarbara," Leader? Fat man, you couldn't even run a bath."
Neutopia,LaBarbara," Well, you sure can run something  Your mouth!"
Neutopia,Big rock Alien, Silence! Even a young pebble could see your race is divided based on the configuration of your twenty-third chromosome.
Neutopia,Amy," [confused] You mean, ""along gender lines""?"
Neutopia,Big rock Alien, [confused] Gender?
Neutopia,Sal," Yes. You knows, guyses, galses... In that order. [Leela slaps him.] Ows!"
Neutopia,Big rock Alien," I am not familiar with this concept of gender. My species has only a single gender, known as nuchacho."
Neutopia,Zoidberg," Interesting. [furiously] Come on, men! Let's kill him!"
Neutopia,Big rock Alien," Your genders differ in many ways, but, as with all things that are different, chocolate and vanilla, Mac and PC, one is always clearly better."
Neutopia,Bender," Chocolate, Mac, men. The end."
Neutopia,Big rock Alien," Well, I've got nothing to do for the next eight million years. Therefore, I will administer a series of tests to determine the superior gender. Test number one  Who can drink the most sulfur? Test inconclusive. Test number two  Who can drink the most arsenic?"
Neutopia,Farnsworth, Just ask us some damn questions.
Neutopia,Big rock Alien, Very well. Which is larger? An Italian size four or an American apparel medium? [Women.] How many calories are in a small green-tea yogurt. [Women.] Name any twelve of the Desperate Housewives. [Women.] How was your day? [Women. The women cheer.] Test complete. What is the score?
Neutopia,Bender," Uh... Men, five. Women, less."
Neutopia,Amana, Hey! He's lying.
Neutopia,Big rock Alien, Obviously. That was a test to see who could lie better. The men win that round.
Neutopia,Farnsworth," In your face, decumbent urinators."
Neutopia,Big rock Alien," So far, I have learned nothing, but that's probably as much my fault as yours. [enthusiastically] The time has come for the final test."
Neutopia,Fry," Uh, we usually call it the lightning round."
Neutopia,Big rock Alien," As you may have noticed, it's getting hotter here."
Neutopia,Leela, It's nice.
Neutopia,Fry, It's too hot.
Neutopia,Zoidberg, [angrily] Would one of you chicks change the thermostat?
Neutopia,Big rock Alien," Tomorrow morning, this planet makes its closest pass to the sun. You will all be boiled alive like retired circus animals. Unless you somehow can cross the Great Alkali Plains and reach shelter in the Cave of Harmony."
Neutopia,Fry, That sounds hard.
Neutopia,Big rock Alien," Which ever gender reaches the cave will survive and may the inferior gender burst into something. Flames, I guess."
Neutopia,Hermes, Uh-oh. I think we're walking in circles. I recognise the pattern of striations on that gypsum formation.
Neutopia,Fry," Also, my shoe that fell off."
Neutopia,Bender," Oh, God. We're all gonna die in agony."
Neutopia,Small rock Alien, Howdy there. You fellows need some directions?
Neutopia,Bender," No, we're fine."
Neutopia,Farnsworth, Beat it.
Neutopia,Fry, Don't worry about it.
Neutopia,LaBarbara," Keep it up, sistren. Only a few more miles to the cave. Let's just buckle down and—"
Neutopia,Amy, Look! A clearance sale!
Neutopia,LaBarbara, What?! Where?
Neutopia,LaBarbara, I can't believe that sale was just a mirage. Now we're going to die without so much as a factory second-clutch purse to show for it.
Neutopia,Amy, It would've been nice to shop at Tommy Hilfiger one last time.
Neutopia,Hattie, It wasn't Tommy Hilfi-gigger. It was Linens 'n Things!
Neutopia,Petunia, The hell it was! It was a Juicy Couture!
Neutopia,Leela, I guess we all saw what we wanted to see.
Neutopia,Hermes, We can't make it tonight. We'll set up camp here by this shoe.
Neutopia,Farnsworth," Oh, gentlemen. When that sun rises in the morning, we're toast. These are our last moments together. So, if anyone's got any good fart jokes, now would be the time."
Neutopia,Amy, It's a schmundered degrees and all we have to drink are non-diet sodas.
Neutopia,Petunia, It's gonna ruin ma figger.
Neutopia,Leela," Wait. I forgot that Amana here is a refrigerator. If we could supercharge her freon with a gas compressor, we might survive the heat and make it to the cave."
Neutopia,Amana," Hey, yeah! But the only gas compressor on this planet is inside Bender's ass."
Neutopia,Dr. Cahill, Was that a fart joke? Because I don't find those amusing.
Neutopia,LaBarbara," No one does! Nevertheless, Bender's gas blaster may be our only hope."
Neutopia,Hermes," Oh! Wife? What are you doin' with Bender's shiny metal, gas compressor?"
Neutopia,LaBarbara, None of your Biz Markie. Wait a second. What's that do wah in your ditty bag?
Neutopia,Hermes, Okay... So we were hot. I stole Amana's freon coil so we could hook it up to Bender's ass and build a cooler.
Neutopia,LaBarbara," You are no better than me, ya shifty tree skink! How do you live with yourself?"
Neutopia,Hermes," Damn it, woman! You are makin' me highly Selassie."
Neutopia,LaBarbara," Don't you talk to me that way, you big, hairy Belafonte!"
Neutopia,Hermes," Oh... You cookin' me back bacon. Thank you, woman."
Neutopia,LaBarbara, That's not back bacon! That's your back bakin'!
Neutopia,Hermes," Oh, no! We overslept."
Neutopia,Amy, The mercury's boiling!
Neutopia,Petunia, Can't breathe... Lungs burnin'...
Neutopia,Fry, My lucky shoe!
Neutopia,Bender," Goodbye, cruel me! [Bender.] I learned that from a movie."
Neutopia,Big rock Alien," I find both genders supremely disappointing. The real reason I administered this bizarre, outer-space test was to teach you to work together! But you couldn't. Thanks to you, I lost my bet with the Borax Kid."
Neutopia,Fry, Never bet against me being stupid.
Neutopia,Big rock Alien, Enough! Your gender differences have kept you from achieving harmony. There is only one way to resolve this conflict.
Neutopia,Fry, Wait. Why didn't that hurt? [Fry screams effeminately.] My wing-wang's gone!
Neutopia,Leela, My girls!
Neutopia,Bender, My antenna!
Neutopia,Hattie, My kajigger!
Neutopia,Zoidberg, My gonopores! Look it up.
Neutopia,Big rock Alien, I have freed you from the tyranny of gender. Now go in peace. Or actually stay here. I'll go in peace.
Neutopia,Farnsworth," Good news, nuchachos! The ship is nearly repaired."
Neutopia,Sal, Work goes fasters withouts no secondary sex characteristicses at which to hoot. Now who wants to sing some Christopher Cross songs?
Neutopia,LaBarbara, I do!
Neutopia,Fry," Look, associates. I made a hammock from our clothing."
Neutopia,Leela, How industrious!
Neutopia,Amy, Do you mind if we sleep with you?
Neutopia,Fry," I have no opinion. [They get on the hammock.] Well, good night."
Neutopia,Hermes, Everyone got along so well today.
Neutopia,LaBarbara, Yes. This place is like a neutered utopia. [LaBarbara gasps.] A neutopia!
Neutopia,Hermes, I enjoy humour when no one gets hurt.
Neutopia,LaBarbara," Your companionship is inoffensive, Hermes."
Neutopia,Hermes," Likewise. Really, what are we missing out on by not having sex right now?"
Neutopia,LaBarbara, Well...
Neutopia,Hermes, Give us back our genitals!
Neutopia,Big rock Alien," Is that you, Borax Kid? I've got your fifty bucks. [The Alien turns around and sees the Humans.] Oh, it's you. Why do you want your genders? You seem happier without them."
Neutopia,LaBarbara, Bein' Human isn't just about bein' happy! It's about lovin' and fightin' and that rasta MacNasty we were doin' last night. [LaBarbara laughs.] We want that back.
Neutopia,Big rock Alien, Very well. Perhaps it is I who have learned a lesson. Or something.
Neutopia,Bender, Now what?
Neutopia,Big rock Alien," I have decided, after little thought, to return your genders."
Neutopia,Amy," Not cool, bro! Our genders are all reversed!"
Neutopia,Hattie," Now I got a what-ya-call-it instead of a kajigger, you stupid what-ya-call-it!"
Neutopia,Big rock Alien, Okay. Stop yelling at me! It was an innocent mistake. Allow me to rectify it.
Neutopia,Zapp, I got your distress call and came as quickly as I wanted to. No need to thank me.
Neutopia,Leela," What's your problem, Holmes? Now we'll be stuck like this forever!"
Neutopia,Zapp," Chill out, dude. [to Fry] Well, hello from the neck down."
Neutopia,Bender, Thank you for your patronage. We know you have a choice in airlines and you made the wrong one. No refunds!
Neutopia,Hermes, Aren't we going to cuddle?
Neutopia,LaBarbara," Woman, I'm tired! I'm sorry. It's just... I need my sleep. I got to get up five times a night to play Xbox."
Neutopia,Hermes," I understand. Womanhood also takes some getting used to. For example, did you know there are more than two feelin's?"
Neutopia,LaBarbara," I only need one feelin'  Love for you, wifey man."
Neutopia,Hermes, Your manwich!
Neutopia,LaBarbara, No wonder it's such a mess in there. These bad boys are hard to aim.
Neutopia,Leela," I hate being a man. I smell bad, my face is scratchy, and the food at those strip clubs is terrible."
Neutopia,Amy," Crappin' A! Still, I'm sure the women are having an even harder time."
Neutopia,Bender, OMG! Being chicks is so much fun.
Neutopia,Fry," Now, when I say stupid things, guys all laugh and buy me stuff."
Neutopia,Leela," What a skank. Anyway, Planet Express is still facing foreclosure. There's no way we can raise enough money to save this company."
Neutopia,Amy, Wait. What about the girly calendar?
Neutopia,Fry," Well, that won't work, remember? We only have three women on staff—"
Neutopia,LaBarbara," ""All female employees must pose nude if requested."""
Neutopia,Leela, And it is requested.
Neutopia,Farnsworth, Let's just hope we can sell enough of these calendars by tomorrow.
Neutopia,Farnsworth, [voice over] We sold enough of those calendars since yesterday!
Neutopia,Leela, Thank God most of our fans are huge perverts!
Neutopia,Fry," Who're you, stranger?"
Neutopia,Borax Kid," Well, madam, folks called me the Borax Kid. My friend, the other rock Alien, died without settin' your genitals to right, so I reckon it's up to me to sex you up proper."
Neutopia,Leela, My girls are back!
Neutopia,Fry, Ow! Yay!
Neutopia,Hermes," So what did you like better, my love? Bein' a man or a woman?"
Neutopia,LaBarbara, I don't care what parts I have. As long as they interlock with yours.
Neutopia,Farnsworth," Ah, marriage. It combines the contentedness of being neutered with the occasional sex of being not."
Neutopia,Borax Kid," Well, I'd best mosey on down to the landing. Sounds like the feldspar queen is about to set sail. You folks watch your genitals now. [The Borax Kid leaves.] Come on, boy! Giddy up!"
Neutopia,Leela, And that's that.
Neutopia,Scruffy, What I miss?
Neutopia,,
Yo Leela Leela,,
Yo Leela Leela,Albert, I got one!
Yo Leela Leela,Warden Vogel," Okay, kids. Put away the dust motes 'til tomorrow. [Warden Vogel puts the sign on the painting surface.] It's story time! [Twelve orphans, including Sally, gather and sit on the floor, sounding excited.] Today's storyteller is a space captain who grew up right here at the Orphanarium. Welcome back the bedwetter of building D, Turanga Leela!"
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Hi, kids! [Leela waves.] What book would you like me to read first?"
Yo Leela Leela,Albert, We don't got books no more.
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, [confused] What?
Yo Leela Leela,Warden Vogel," He means any more. Look, sometimes you gotta choose between eatin' and reading. [angry] So they ate the books. Just... Make somethin' up!"
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Make something up? Um... Okay. [Leela sits on a small chair.] Once upon a time, there was a... A..."
Yo Leela Leela,Sally, Princess?
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Yes! That! [The orphans sound excited.] A... One-eyed princess in a long, flowing... Tank top. And she lived in a magical, one-room..."
Yo Leela Leela,Sally, Castle?
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Yeah. If you believe the listing agent. Anyhow, one day, the princess went off to... Uh... Tell a story! And, then, that's exactly what she did do that. And they all lived happily ever after. The end."
Yo Leela Leela,Albert, Miss Leela? I have a question!
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Yes, Albert?"
Yo Leela Leela,Albert, That story was bad.
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, That's not really a question.
Yo Leela Leela,Albert, That wasn't really a story.
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," [sad] I'm sorry, kids. I'm not a natural storyteller. [The small chair falls off.] [with conviction] But I promise  I'll make up a better story and come back again."
Yo Leela Leela,Sally, [sad] Please don't...
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, See you soon!
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," I'm sure I've got a great kids' story in me. I just need to think of three of some kind of animal. Concentrate, Leela! Concentrate! [Leela is annoyed by the trombone that Fry is playing ""When the Saints Go Marching In"" with.] [over the noise, screaming] Fry, I'm writing here! Do you have to play that?"
Yo Leela Leela,Fry, [innocently] Yes. [sad] It's the only song I know.
Yo Leela Leela,Zoidberg," Look, friends! I accidentally learned to tap-dance!"
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," [over the noise, screaming] Zoidberg, I'm trying to—"
Yo Leela Leela,Hermes, Time for my four-twenty-one daiquiri!
Yo Leela Leela,Bender, Guys! Guys! Guess who just got commissioned as a tugboat!
Yo Leela Leela,Amy," Oh, yeah! Pachinko break!"
Yo Leela Leela,Pachinko machine, [in a Japanese accent] Tokyo crazy balls! Yes!
Yo Leela Leela,Farnsworth," Ooh, good, Leela. You're here. [Leela looks at Professor Farnsworth.] I'd like to describe my foot pain. [Professor Farnsworth sits down and puts his left foot on the table.] My left has a sharp jabbing throb near the bunion, while the other's got a searing pain like gout. [Leela looks repulsed and covers her ears.] Maybe it's too much albumin because of gravity..."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Even if I had a pen, I couldn't write under these conditions. [Leela grabs her writing pad and stands up.] I'm going to some other planet, where I can concentrate."
Yo Leela Leela,Farnsworth," [continued] Searing, searing pain that feels as if it were in a vice."
Yo Leela Leela,Bender," [offended] Well, that was rude."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Warden Vogel, I have a new story for the children. [Warden Vogel looks up at Leela.] I'm sure they'll like it more than my last one."
Yo Leela Leela,Warden Vogel," They liked hunger cramps more than your last one. Anyhow, you'll have to wait. The kids are busy right now."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, Oh. Is the organ-harvesting clown here?
Yo Leela Leela,Warden Vogel," Nah. Rusty comes on Tuesdays now. Today, it's the owner of the Tickelodeon Kids Network."
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal," Okay, kids. [Abner Doubledeal points at the children with his right hand.] Get ready to be subjected to our new Fall shows! Mr. Funny Bunny here will gauge your reaction by bombarding your brains with harmless snuggle rays."
Yo Leela Leela,Albert," He gives me a nice, warm feeling in my eyeballs!"
Yo Leela Leela,Male voice #1, Popular Slut Club.
Yo Leela Leela,Little girl #1," Oh, my God! [The second little girl takes off her glasses. The first little girl points to something in front of them.] There's Jake Thinkleburg! [The first little girl folds her hands.] He's so hot! [sad] I wish he wasn't my brother."
Yo Leela Leela,Male voice #1, Popular Slut Club.
Yo Leela Leela,Male voice #2, Look! Up on the drive-through menu! It's Captain Mega Meat and his young ward Bottomless Boy!
Yo Leela Leela,Bottomless Boy," Hurry, Captain! [Bottomless Boy points at something in front of them.] A skinny kid needs our help!"
Yo Leela Leela,Captain Mega Meat, Supersize me!
Yo Leela Leela,Male voice #3," From the ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper daycare centre in Glasgow, Scotland, it's Extreme Toddler Wrestling!"
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal," Thanks for the brain scans, kids. [Abner Doubledeal steers the shelf as he leaves.] Don't have any children for the next couple of days."
Yo Leela Leela,Warden Vogel," Alright, boys and girls. Enough fun! Your old friend Leela is back with a brand-new story!"
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, Hi! It's great to be back. [Leela proceeds to her right.] I think you'll enjoy this one.
Yo Leela Leela,Sally, Please! [Sally raises her right hand.] Can't we just get our organs harvested?
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," It's about some cute, little creatures from a land called Rumbledy-Hump. [Leela puts the mini-piano and the creatures in cardboard on the small shelf, unfolds the piece of cardboard, puts the piece of cardboard on the painting surface, revealing it to depict a landscape with two trees, and sits on the stool.] Kids, let's meet the Humplings! [Leela presses a button on the mini-piano and grabs the creatures in cardboard. The piano starts playing. Two other creatures can be seen. The first creature is orange and the second is both pink and yellow. Leela holds up the red creature.]"
Yo Leela Leela,"[in a different tone, singing] My name is Lady Buggle and I huggle all my friends. [Leela sticks the red creature to the piece of cardboard and holds up the blue creature.]",
Yo Leela Leela,[in a different tone] I'm a silly spring named Doingg and my bouncing never ends. [Leela makes the blue creature jump three times.] Doingg. Doingg. Doingg. [Leela sticks the blue creature to the piece of cardboard and makes the pink and yellow creature jump three times.],
Yo Leela Leela,"[in a different tone] They call me Princess Num Num. I'm as sweet as sticky buns. [Leela sticks the pink and yellow creature to the piece of cardboard, holds up the purple creature, and makes it jump three times.]",
Yo Leela Leela,[in a different tone] I'm Feffernoose. [Leela removes the red creature from the piece of cardboard and holds it up.],
Yo Leela Leela,"[in her own tone, spoken] Hello. [Leela makes the purple creature jump five times.]",
Yo Leela Leela,"[in a different tone, singing] I'm scared of everyones.",
Yo Leela Leela,"[in her own tone, spoken] Oh, Feffernoose. [Leela sticks the purple creature and the red creature to the piece of cardboard and puts her right hand in front of her mouth, holding the orange creature with her left hand.]",
Yo Leela Leela,"[in a different tone, indistinctively] What about me? [Leela removes the red creature from the piece of cardboard and holds it up.]",
Yo Leela Leela,"[in her own tone, distinctively] Hey, it's Garbly. Everyone loves him 'cause they can't understand him.",
Yo Leela Leela,"[in a different tone, indistinctively] It's nice to meet you.",
Yo Leela Leela,"[in her own tone, distinctively, singing] We're here to make you laugh and think and smile and learn and sing.",
Yo Leela Leela,And laugh and learn and smile and think and other happy things.,
Yo Leela Leela,Albert, Say more things like that!
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Okey-doke. One sunny, funny day, there was an unfamiliar visitor in Rumbledy-Hump."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," [in a different tone, off camera, singing] Today we learned that folks are not as different as they seem. [Leela is holding up the pink and yellow creature and holds up a gorilla wearing a backpack that is connected to his mouth by a pipe and holding a flower with his left hand.]"
Yo Leela Leela,[in her own tone] The space gorilla's just like us.,
Yo Leela Leela,[in a different tone] Although I breathe chlorine.,
Yo Leela Leela,Sally, Wow! I can't believe you imaginated all that stuff!
Yo Leela Leela,Nina, Will you come back again and tell us more stories and also adopt us all?
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, Of course I'll tell you more stories. [Leela stands up.] I'll go think some up right now.
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal," Holy moly! [Abner Doubledeal throws his mask away. Leela enters.] Lady, you don't know me, but my name is Abner Doubledeal."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, Wait! I know you! You're Abner Doubledeal!
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal," I brain-scanned those little nose-pickers during your story. And, sister, their enjoyment glands were squirtin' like Broadway roadkill!"
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, [touched] Aw. [Leela folds her hands.] They were?!
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal," Say, you seem like a smart mark. [Abner Doubledeal points at Leela.] How'd you like to make it into a TV show? Sign here, 'round this... Uh... [Abner Doubledeal grabs a piece of paper from his jacket.] Supercuts coupon."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, [sad] I dunno. [Leela shrugs.] Don't I need a degree to write gibberish for toddlers?
Yo Leela Leela,Nina," Come on, Miss Leela! [Leela looks at Nina. Nina points at Leela with her left hand.] Don't be a fraidy cat like Feffernoose!"
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, Okay. I'll do it! [Leela raises her right hand.] To show you kids you can succeed at anything. [Abner Doubledeal is holding a pen.] If you just luck out hard enough.
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal," [excited] Welcome to the glamourous, big-money world of basic cable TV! [Abner Doubledeal shakes Leela's hand.] [sad] I'm gonna need that pen back."
Yo Leela Leela,Hermes, Working on a real TV show is so exciting! I'm on a mostly natural high!
Yo Leela Leela,Amy, These costumes are gonna make it hard to go to the bathroom.
Yo Leela Leela,Fry, I'm not havin' any problem.
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal," We're shooting in five minutes and this Leela broad hasn't even delivered a script yet! Sweet Zombie Jesus! Like it's not hard enough to make a freakin' TV show for under fifty bucks! [The spaceship arrives.] Damn it, I'll call you back, grandma. Nice of you to show up, toots. I mean that sincerely. It's just that I'm in show biz."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, Sorry. I went to my quiet place to write. Here's the script.
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal," Argh! You writers make me sick. Nice job on the script, though. Places, everyone. [He makes copies of the script.] Okay. Cheap lights. Off-brand camera. And non-union action!"
Yo Leela Leela,Fry," [dressed as Doingg] I like ice cream. And I like lollipops. And I like you, Princess Num Num."
Yo Leela Leela,Amy, [dressed as Princess Num Num] Ew! I'm all licky-sticky!
Yo Leela Leela,Fry," [dressed as Doingg] I don't understand. When I like something, I lick it. Like this raccoon."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, [dressed as Lady Buggle] Doingg! Don't lick things that don't wanna be licked.
Yo Leela Leela,Fry, [dressed as Doingg] But how do I know what to lick and what not to lick?
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," [dressed as Lady Buggle] It's very simple. [singing] If it's alive, don't lick it."
Yo Leela Leela,Zoidberg," [dressed as Feffernoose, singing] Like a horse, a turtle, or a cricket."
Yo Leela Leela,Bender," [dressed as Garbly, indistinctively] I like turtles."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," [dressed as Lady Buggle, singing] So, if you're not sure if it's alive or dead,"
Yo Leela Leela,Poke it with a stick and lick the stick instead.,
Yo Leela Leela,Fry, [dressed as Doingg] Now I get it!
Yo Leela Leela,Zoidberg, [dressed as Feffernoose] Ow!
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," [dressed as Lady Buggle] Well, that's all for today. But, before we go, let's do everything we just did two more times."
Yo Leela Leela,Bender," Leela, that was great! Even I have to admire the performance of me, Bender!"
Yo Leela Leela,Amy," The show looks so cute. Kids'll love it! And it looks so cruddy, their ironic hipster parents will love it."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Thanks, guys. But let's be realistic. We all know any TV show that's even slightly good gets cancelled. Sometimes, two or three times."
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal, Leela! Tomorrow's ratings just came in from the future. We're a hit!
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, What?! My show is a hit?!
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal," What are you, deaf? It's gonna be bigger than SpongeBot SquareBolts!"
Yo Leela Leela,SpongeBot SquareBolts, I interfere with pacemakers!
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal," Baby, I hope you like drowning in caviar. 'Cause that is how you're gonna die!"
Yo Leela Leela,Calculon," Welcome back to the Young People's Choice Awards. In a moment, the award for Outstanding Sext Message. But, first, the nominees for Best New Kids' Show are... Yo Gimme Gimme!, The Adventures of Pit-Bull and Scaredy Squirrel, Dora the Destroyer, and Rumbledy-Hump."
Yo Leela Leela,Fry," I hope you win, Leela."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Thanks, Fry. It's nice to have the support of viewers like you."
Yo Leela Leela,Fry, I'm the star of the show.
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, Shh!
Yo Leela Leela,Calculon, And the Slurmie for Best New Kids' Show goes to... Turanga Leela for Rumbledy-Hump!
Yo Leela Leela,Female voice, This is Turanga Leela's first nomination and second time in high heels.
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Wow. I feel so lucky just to have been nominated alongside so many inferior shows. And, to all my young friends at the Orphanarium, thank you for inspiring me to be your hero."
Yo Leela Leela,Calculon, Slurm her!
Yo Leela Leela,Bender, So wait. You play a high-school student who's also secretly a rock star who's also secretly a massage chair?
Yo Leela Leela,Fembot," No. I play a high-school student who's also secretly a rock star, but, in real life, I'm a massage chair."
Yo Leela Leela,Bender, Hmmm. You ever made out with a tugboat?
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Guys, I didn't have time to mention it up there, but I want each of you to know what an honour it is to work with me."
Yo Leela Leela,Hermes, Sweet ego of Montego! Someone build a wind farm in front of her mouth.
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal," Leela, I mean this. You're the greatest creative mind since blah, blah, blah-bity, blah. But it's two AM and you still haven't written tomorrow's episode."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Well, you can't expect me to write it here, with everyone talking so loudly about how great I am."
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal, Sorry.
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, I'm taking the ship to my quiet place so I can be alone. You non-creatives can catch a bus home.
Yo Leela Leela,Fry, Non-creative? Ha! I'll have you know I bedazzle my own underpants.
Yo Leela Leela,Bender," That was a helluva massage. Maybe the best there ever was. Say, where are we? Rumbledy-Hump?! It's real!"
Yo Leela Leela,Doingg," I love eating vegetables. Don't you? They're like crunchy, green water."
Yo Leela Leela,Garbly, [indistinctively] I don't like 'em. They're icky-yucky!
Yo Leela Leela,Lady Buggle," Now, now, Garbly. If we don't eat our vegetables, we won't grow big and strong... Like Feffernoose."
Yo Leela Leela,Feffernoose, I have to be big and strong to fight off the monsters. Did somebody say monsters?!
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, This will make a great episode. But talk slower. I can't type that fast.
Yo Leela Leela,Bender," Well, well, well. You didn't make up that TV show! You just wrote down what these space twerps said!"
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Oh, hell."
Yo Leela Leela,Princess Num Num, Leela said a Rumbledy-Hump no-no!
Yo Leela Leela,Humplings," [singing] Sometimes, when we're mad,"
Yo Leela Leela,We say words that are bad.,
Yo Leela Leela,Humplings, [singing] And poo-poo and pee-pee and penis and gay.
Yo Leela Leela,Those are the ninety-eight words we don't say.,
Yo Leela Leela,Bender," My God. You stole all your ideas from those poor, innocent creatures and hogged all the credit?! I underestimated you."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, Wait! I can explain.
Yo Leela Leela,Bender," Nah, don't ruin it. I'm lovin' the hypocrisy. It's like catchin' an evangelist in a whorehouse. That was the best Christmas ever."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," You know I hate lying. But those orphans were so proud of me, I couldn't bear to let them down."
Yo Leela Leela,Bender, Pfff! At least Reverend Pickens had the dignity to jump out the whorehouse window with his pants around his ankles.
Yo Leela Leela,Princess Num Num," Who's your friend, Leela? He sure has a shiny metal bumbledy-boop."
Yo Leela Leela,Bender," Aw, they're so cute and harmless. No wonder you feel safe rippin' off their act."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, Bender! I feel bad enough already.
Yo Leela Leela,Bender," I'm just messin' with ya. I love that you're gettin' rich off of them. 'Cause, now, I can get rich off of you!"
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Oh, Lord."
Yo Leela Leela,Bender," From now on, you give me half the gross or I'll blow your cover."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Fine. You'll get your cut. I don't really care about the money, anyway. I just wanna show those poor, disadvantaged orphans that they can succeed in life."
Yo Leela Leela,Bender, Ugh. You are the worst kind of rich person.
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," [dressed as Lady Buggle, singing] Be it parsnips or peppers or kale or zucchini."
Yo Leela Leela,Fry," [dressed as Doingg, singing] I like to relax with a spinach martini."
Yo Leela Leela,Bender," [dressed as Garbly, singing] A-gurgle bufwoozle didoodi houdini."
Yo Leela Leela,All," [dressed as Humplings, singing] 'Cause we love our vegetables."
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal," And... Cut! That's a wrap, everybody. Ten-minute break, then we shoot season three."
Yo Leela Leela,Fry," Leela, you may have become a Lady Gaga-esque fame hag, but you sure cheered up those orphans. Nice job."
Yo Leela Leela,Warden Vogel, Thanks so much for inviting us to the taping. The kids haven't been this excited since food day!
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Aw, thanks. They're my inspiration."
Yo Leela Leela,Bender," But not your only inspiration. Am I right, Leels?"
Yo Leela Leela,Albert, Is somebody standing on me?
Yo Leela Leela,Bender, I do love inconveniencing the underclass.
Yo Leela Leela,Warden Vogel," Well, we'll be on our way. After we dig through your trash for aluminum. Okay, kids. Delta pattern. Go! Go! Go!"
Yo Leela Leela,Sally, Miss Leela?
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Yes, Sally?"
Yo Leela Leela,Sally," I wanna show you the story I made up. That's Gum Drop, Sticky, Candy Corn, Sour Ball, and Jujube. They're brothers and sisters and they live in Butterscotch Hollow."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Sally, that's wonderful. You came up with that yourself? Out of thin air? How?"
Yo Leela Leela,Sally," You were an orphan and now you're the best writer ever, so I knew I could write too. Thank you for being my hero."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, I can't do this any more.
Yo Leela Leela,Farnsworth, I don't blame you. Having to wear a costume made from a hollowed-out walrus...
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Everyone, I have a confession. I, Turanga Leela, winner of a Young People's Choice Award, a Peabody Jr, and two Training Emmys, am not what I appear to be. There's something I need to show you."
Yo Leela Leela,Bender, Uh-oh.
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Continuing my confession, this is the hardest thing I've ever done."
Yo Leela Leela,Sally, Harder than creating the bestest show in the world?
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, I didn't create anything. I stole it.
Yo Leela Leela,Bender, Stealin' is a form of creativity!
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," No, it isn't. Guys! Come on out!"
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal, Holy moly again.
Yo Leela Leela,Lady Buggle," Oh, hello, Leela. I was just telling my friends how they shouldn't eat food off the floor. Should we sing a song about it?"
Yo Leela Leela,Fry," Yes, please!"
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," No need, Lady Buggle."
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal," Say, what's goin' on here?"
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, This planet is the real Rumbledy-Hump. And these creatures are the real Humplings. All I did was write down their adorably repetitious hijinks.
Yo Leela Leela,Sally, You lied? Like Doingg did when he stole Garbly's pet pinecone?
Yo Leela Leela,Doingg, You told them about that?
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, I should've told the truth right away. These simply prairie folk have a simple prairie-ish life here. And I was wrong to exploit it for profit.
Yo Leela Leela,Lady Buggle, I'm as sad as an upside-down smile.
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, You mean a frown?
Yo Leela Leela,Lady Buggle, We didn't have a word for it... Until now.
Yo Leela Leela,Amy, To think I put on an unflattering cupcake costume for you!
Yo Leela Leela,Fry, To think I borrowed money from you!
Yo Leela Leela,Albert, I was gonna ask you to marry me.
Yo Leela Leela,Sally," I guess, if you can't make up stories, I can't neither."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, I deserve this. And more. Keep it coming!
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal," Wait a second. As a big Hollywood TV producer, I think I know how to remedy this ethical lapse."
Yo Leela Leela,Lady Buggle, [singing] So if you don't want a tapeworm or intestinal bug...
Yo Leela Leela,Humplings, [singing] Don't eat pastrami that fell on the rug.
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal, And... Cut! Ta-da! We got us a reality show! No writers. No actors. No problem.
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Doubledeal, this is disgraceful! You can't just rip off their real lives and put it on TV!"
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal, Wha? Who said anything about rippin' them off?
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, I did!
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal," I'm payin' 'em. Gather 'round, gang. Here're your pay checks."
Yo Leela Leela,Garbly, [indistinctively] I can finally afford my speech therapy!
Yo Leela Leela,Feffernoose, And the health plan covers my generic Prozac!
Yo Leela Leela,Lady Buggle," Electricity, plumbing... Our lives are a jillion times better. And it's all thanks to you, Leela."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, Don't thank me! I should be punished! I've corrupted you and taught the orphans a terrible lesson.
Yo Leela Leela,Warden Vogel, What orphans?! The kids were all adopted!
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, They were?! By who?!
Yo Leela Leela,Abner Doubledeal," Come on, kids. Let's get this place cleaned up for the next episode. Albert, pick up that pastrami and put it back on the craft services table."
Yo Leela Leela,Albert," You're the boss, Daddy."
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Oh, God! What have I done?!"
Yo Leela Leela,Nina, You've given us a new father and a full-time job! Which is more than most kids have!
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, But—
Yo Leela Leela,Sally," We love it here, Miss Leela. This is the funnest planet in the whole world!"
Yo Leela Leela,Leela," Don't hug me! I've done a horrible thing! For God's sakes, somebody teach me a lesson!"
Yo Leela Leela,Orphans and Humplings, [repeatedly] We love Leela!
Yo Leela Leela,Leela, [extendedly] No!
Yo Leela Leela,,
Mars University,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. [He presses a button on the trolley and it lowers itself to the floor.] We've got a very special delivery today."
Mars University,Fry, Who's it going to?
Mars University,Farnsworth, Me.
Mars University,Bender, Another job well done.
Mars University,Farnsworth," No, I need it shipped to my office at Mars University. [He strokes the crate.] It's a little experiment that may well win me the Nobel Prize."
Mars University,Leela, In what field?
Mars University,Farnsworth," I don't care, they all pay the same."
Mars University,Fry, Is it dangerous?
Mars University,Farnsworth," Oh, my, no. [Fry kicks the box and the thing inside starts growling and shaking the box. Fry runs and hides behind Leela. Farnsworth pulls a tranquiliser gun out of nowhere and loads a tranquiliser dart into it. He pokes the gun through a hole in the crate and shoots whatever is inside. It whimpers and the shaking and growling stops.] Off we go!"
Mars University,Fry, Very impressive. Back in the 20th century we had no idea there was a university on Mars.
Mars University,Farnsworth," Well, in those days Mars was just a dreary, uninhabitable wasteland, uh, much like Utah. But unlike Utah, it was eventually made livable, when the university was founded in 2636."
Mars University,Leela," They planted traditional college foliage; ivy, trees, hemp. Soon the whole planet was terraformed."
Mars University,Fry, Does that mean it's safe to breathe the air?
Mars University,Farnsworth, Of course.
Mars University,Farnsworth, Over here is Wong Library. It has the largest collection of literature in the Western Universe.
Mars University,Bender," [pointing] Hey, look! There's a chapter of my old robot fraternity, Epsilon Rho Rho."
Mars University,Leela, You went to college?
Mars University,Bender," Of course. I'm a bender, I went to Bending College. I majored in Bending."
Mars University,Fry, What was your minor?
Mars University,Bender, Robo-American Studies.
Mars University,Fratbot #1, Are you here to fumigate the moose head?
Mars University,Bender," Uh, no, actually I'm an Epsilon from way back."
Mars University,Fratbot #1," Eh, close enough. C'mon in."
Mars University,Bender, Thanks. Here's your finger back.
Mars University,Bender, All the coolest robots are in this fraternity.
Mars University,Fratbot #2, Mate in 143 moves.
Mars University,Fratbot #3," Oh, pooh. You win again!"
Mars University,Bender," Uh-oh, nerds!"
Mars University,Fratbot #1," Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Gearshift, chapter president. This is Oily, and this here is Fat-bot."
Mars University,Bender, You're all losers. My name's Bender.
Mars University,Oily," Bender from Bending State Bender? Wow, you're a legend around here!"
Mars University,Fat-bot," I heard that in one single night you drank a whole keg, streaked across campus and crammed 58 humans into a phone booth."
Mars University,Bender," [modest] Yeah, well, a lot of 'em were children. Anyway I should get going."
Mars University,Gearshift," No, Bender, wait. We're the lamest frat on campus. Even Hillel has better parties than us. Please, you've gotta stay and teach us how to be cool."
Mars University,Bender," Hmm, OK. But I'll need 10 kegs of beer, a continuous tape of Louie Louie and a regulation two-storey panty-raid ladder."
Mars University,Fat-bot," Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!"
Mars University,Fry," I tell you, being here really takes me back to my college days."
Mars University,Man #1, Step right up. Who wants to learn physics?
Mars University,Man #2, [from inside] Keep your hands inside the car at all times.
Mars University,Fry," Good old Coney Island College! Go, Whitefish!"
Mars University,Leela," Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but you don't seem like the educated type."
Mars University,Fry," Oh, yeah? [He takes a piece of paper out of his pocket with ""Notice of Failure to Graduate"" written on it. The CICC logo is a Ferris wheel.] Read it and weep. I'm a certified college dropout."
Mars University,Leela, Please! Everyone knows 20th century colleges were basically expensive daycare centres.
Mars University,Farnsworth," That's true. By current academic standards, you're merely a high school dropout."
Mars University,Fry," What? That's not fair. I deserve the same respect any other college dropout gets. By God, I'm gonna enroll here at Mars University and drop out all over again!"
Mars University,Leela, You won't last two weeks.
Mars University,Fry," Aww, thanks for believing in me."
Mars University,Amy," Yo, classmate. What you takin'?"
Mars University,Fry," Oh, I don't know. [Farnsworth walks past with his crate on a hover trolley.] Hey, Professor, what are you teaching this semester?"
Mars University,Farnsworth, Same thing I teach every semester  The Mathematics of Quantum Neutrino Fields. I made up the title so that no student would dare take it.
Mars University,Fry, [writing] Mathematics of wanton burrito meals. [He points his pencil at Farnsworth.] I'll be there!
Mars University,Farnsworth," Please, Fry, I don't know how to teach; I'm a professor!"
Mars University,Fry, See you in class!
Mars University,Farnsworth, Oh!
Mars University,Fat-bot, This is gonna be great!
Mars University,Bender, [from outside] Bingo!
Mars University,Fat-bot," [from outside] Oh, mama!"
Mars University,Bender," [from outside] Oh, yeah! Someone's been a bad computer! [The girl takes the front of the Mac revealing the circuits inside. The fratbots gasp.] Get a load of that!"
Mars University,Meiderneyer," I say, you've damaged our servants' quarters ... and our servants."
Mars University,Chet, This time Robot House has gone too far.
Mars University,Bender, Cheese it!
Mars University,Fat-bot, [screaming] They're gonna catch us!
Mars University,Fry," Hey, pretty nice for a single. Two desks, two chairs, a couple of beds. [There is a knock at the door.] A woodpecker."
Mars University,Leela, I think that's probably your roommate.
Mars University,Fry," Oh, right, cool. [shouting] C'mon in, roomie! [He opens the door but there is no one there. He looks down and sees a monkey wearing a bowler hat and carrying two cases.] [talking] What the--?"
Mars University,Monkey, I call top bunk!
Mars University,Fry, My roommate's a monkey?
Mars University,Monkey," [sarcastic] Brilliant deduction, you're a credit to your species."
Mars University,Farnsworth," Ah, Fry, I see you've met Guenter!"
Mars University,Fry, You know each other?
Mars University,Farnsworth, Guenter is my experiment. He was the top secret contents of this stinking crate.
Mars University,Guenter, I'd rather live in a crate than share a room with this dork.
Mars University,Leela, So what makes Guenter talk?
Mars University,Fry, Is he genetically engineered?
Mars University,Farnsworth," Oh, please! That's preposterous science-fiction mumbo-jumbo. Guenter's intelligence actually lies in his electronium hat which harnesses the power of sunspots to produce cognitive radiation."
Mars University,Guenter," You're wasting your breath, Professor. He'll never understand a word of it."
Mars University,Fry," I understood the word ""hat""!"
Mars University,Farnsworth," Please, stop bickering. I arranged that you be roommates for a reason  So I'd only have to remember one phone number. Now shake hands and make up."
Mars University,Fry, You want a banana?
Mars University,Guenter, I don't eat bananas. I prefer banana-flavoured energy bars made from tofu.
Mars University,Fry, I don't like you.
Mars University,Fry, This is gonna be a cakewalk!
Mars University,Teacher," Welcome to the history of the 20th century. Look to your left, then to your right. Then in nine other directions. One of the 12 of you will not pass this class."
Mars University,Amy, Boring. [She leans over to Guenter.] Let's hear about Walter Mondale already!
Mars University,Teacher, Be forewarned  The only sure way to get an A in this class is to have lived in the 20th century.
Mars University,Fry, Swish!
Mars University,Teacher," You were saying, Mr. Fry?"
Mars University,Fry," I'm from the 20th century. Go ahead, ask me anything."
Mars University,Teacher, Very well. What device invented in the 20th century allowed people to view broadcast programmes in their own homes?
Mars University,Fry, Ooh ... I know this ... whatyya call it? Lite Brite!
Mars University,Guenter, I believe the answer is the television.
Mars University,Teacher," Very good, Mr. ... [He checks his list.] ... Guenter."
Mars University,Amy, [impressed] Wow! Smart and cute!
Mars University,Vernon, What I love about being dean of students is the peace and quiet and the respect I receive. [The phone rings.] Now what's all this about?
Mars University,Woman," [on phone] Dean Vernon, the students from Robot House are here."
Mars University,Vernon, Robot House!
Mars University,Bender," Hey, dean, nice looking model."
Mars University,Vernon," You keep away from it. You robots are a disgrace to this university. Whenever a fire alarm is pulled, it's Robot House. Whenever the campus liquor store is looted, Robot House. Whenever a human corpse is desecrated--"
Mars University,Bender," Now, I can explain that."
Mars University,Vernon," That's enough out of you. From this day forth, Robot House is on dodecatupple-secret probation!"
Mars University,Bender, No fair!
Mars University,Fat-bot, My mom is gonna kill me!
Mars University,Vernon," Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to the one thing that's kept me sane these past eight years  My model ship."
Mars University,Gearshift, Fat-bot! No!
Mars University,Fat-bot, When I get nervous I get hungry.
Mars University,Bender, Cheese it!
Mars University,Vernon, [shouting; from inside] Robot House!
Mars University,Fry," So, Chrissy, we seem to be hitting it off. If you're not doing anything later might I escort you to a kegger?"
Mars University,Chrissy, Not even if you were the last man on Mars.
Mars University,Guenter, [shouting] Hey! You like bananas?
Mars University,Guenter, [shouting; from outside] I got her number. How do you like them bananas?
Mars University,Farnsworth," And therefore, by process of elimination, the electron must taste like grapeade."
Mars University,Fry," Sorry, I overslept."
Mars University,Farnsworth, Until 5pm?
Mars University,Fry, It's that obnoxious monkey. He kept me up all night with his constant thinking. Just thinking and thinking. He's trying to make me look like an idiot.
Mars University,Farnsworth," Don't be jealous. Without his special hat, Guenter might be no more intelligent than you."
Mars University,Fry, I hate that rodent!
Mars University,Farnsworth," Fry, that monkey is my most important experiment. If you two don't stop fighting I'll have you both neutered."
Mars University,Fry, That'll show him.
Mars University,Amy," Dean Vernon, I'd like you to meet my parents, Leo and Inez."
Mars University,Vernon," Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Wong, I'm so glad we could admit Amy in exchange for your generous contribution."
Mars University,Mr. Wong, How much more for Phi Beta Kappa?
Mars University,Vernon, How much you got?
Mars University,Guenter," Sorry I'm late, I was off at a study session ... with Chrissy!"
Mars University,Farnsworth," Oh, I'm glad you made it, Guenter because in honour of parents weekend I have a special surprise for you."
Mars University,Guenter, [horrified] Mom? Dad? What are you doing here? [The monkeys start jumping around and shaking the cage bars. The other guests stare and Guenter covers his eyes.] This is so humiliating.
Mars University,Fry, Now these monkeys I like! [The monkeys chomp the bananas and jump around again.] What's that? You wanna come out?
Mars University,Guenter, No! Stop!
Mars University,Chet, I say.
Mars University,Farnsworth, What's that they're flinging at us?
Mars University,Guenter," Oh, dear Lord! All over the dean!"
Mars University,Fry," Hey, uh, Guenter? Why don't you get up on the chandelier with your parents and I'll take a picture?"
Mars University,Bender," Well, looks like the party's winding down. Let's take a road trip to Tijuana and get Fat-bot some action."
Mars University,Fat-bot," It's my first time, I'm really nervous."
Mars University,Vernon, [shouting] Robot House!
Mars University,Leela," What you did to Guenter was cruel. At the risk of sounding like an after-school special, I think we learned who the real animal was today."
Mars University,Fry, You mean peer pressure?
Mars University,Fry, Look out! He's got a gun!
Mars University,Guenter, [crying] Leave me alone.
Mars University,Leela," Hey, what's going on? I thought you didn't like bananas."
Mars University,Guenter, [crying] Of course I do. I try so hard to fit in but seeing my parents act like that made me realise I'm just a primitive beast.
Mars University,Fry," Hey, hey, cheer up. Not everyone turns out like their parents. I mean, look at me. My folks were honest, hard-working people."
Mars University,Leela," Besides, Guenter, you're not like other monkeys. You've got the hat."
Mars University,Guenter," [crying] So what? I mean, sure, it looks cool and it makes me smart but it doesn't make me happy."
Mars University,Leela, That's so sad. I didn't even know monkeys could cry.
Mars University,Guenter, [crying] They can't. It's all the hat.
Mars University,Fry," Look, Guenter, if you're so miserable here, maybe you should just go back to the jungle."
Mars University,Guenter," The jungle. But I couldn't do that to the Professor. I'm his prize experiment, and he's like a father to me."
Mars University,Leela, But he's not your father. That guy in the punch bowl was your father.
Mars University,Farnsworth, Look at him. I'm so proud.
Mars University,Fry," Thanks, Professor!"
Mars University,Farnsworth, Not you.
Mars University,Fry, [screaming] Ow!
Mars University,Student, Hey!
Mars University,Farnsworth," Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why? Why? Why didn't I break his legs?"
Mars University,Farnsworth," [crying] Oh, poor Guenter."
Mars University,Leela, So he just ran away in the middle of the exam?
Mars University,Farnsworth, I'm afraid so. All he handed in was a paper smeared with faeces. He tied with Fry.
Mars University,Fry, I guess he realised I was right when I told him to go back to the jungle.
Mars University,Farnsworth, You what? After I spent months slaving over a hot monkey brain?
Mars University,Fry," Hey, don't blame me. You tried to force Guenter to be a human but he's an animal. He belongs in the wild. Or in the circus on one of those tiny tricycles. Now that's entertainment!"
Mars University,Farnsworth," But Guenter's obviously better off being intelligent. Tell him, Leela."
Mars University,Leela," Nuh-uh, I'm staying out of this. Now here's my opinion  What we should do is..."
Mars University,Farnsworth, What?
Mars University,Leela, I said we'll go to the jungle and let Guenter decide once and for all.
Mars University,Farnsworth, What?
Mars University,Vernon," You all know the rules. Whichever house wins the regatta becomes head of the Greek Council. And should that house currently be on any type of multiple secret probation, it will be lifted and I will be forced to serve as Grand Marshal of a parade honouring them."
Mars University,Chet," I say, Robot House, your water craft is as ill-designed as you yourselves."
Mars University,Meiderneyer," Good one, Chet!"
Mars University,Bender," Oh, yeah? Watch this!"
Mars University,Chet," Well, I never!"
Mars University,Vernon," Fraternities, on your marks."
Mars University,Bender, Hey!
Mars University,Fry, Wow! The jungles on Mars look just like the jungles on Earth.
Mars University,Farnsworth, Jungles? On Earth?
Mars University,Leela, I see some movement up there. I think it's him.
Mars University,Farnsworth, Stand back.
Mars University,Leela, Oops.
Mars University,Farnsworth, Don't worry. They'll be fine once the tranquiliser wears off.
Mars University,Fry, There's our man!
Mars University,Leela," Professor, you'll offer Guenter the hat and, Fry, you'll offer him the banana. [She holds out the hat and banana and they take them.] We'll let him choose whether he wants to be intelligent or just a mindless animal."
Mars University,Farnsworth," Come on, Guenter, take the hat."
Mars University,Fry," No, the banana, the banana!"
Mars University,Farnsworth, Consider the philosophical and metaphysical ramifications of the--
Mars University,Fry," Banana, banana, banana!"
Mars University,Leela," Wait, what's that sound?"
Mars University,Gearshift," [shouting] Hey, Bender, you sure this is a short-cut?"
Mars University,Bender, [shouting] Not as sure as I was an hour ago!
Mars University,Vernon, And the winner is ... [The fratbots appear and walk across the finish line with their raft draped around them.] ... Robot House?
Mars University,Farnsworth," Oh, dear Lord!"
Mars University,Leela, No! No!
Mars University,Farnsworth," Thank God this log is sturdy. [He pats it and a bit breaks off and plunges over the edge. On the riverbank, Guenter finds the hat and banana and sniffs them both.] [shouting] Put on the hat, Guenter! You're the only one who can save us! [Guenter puts the banana on his head and tries to eat the hat.] [muttering] Stupid monkey."
Mars University,Fry, [shouting] No.
Mars University,Leela, [shouting] Not there.
Mars University,Farnsworth, [shouting] Keep trying.
Mars University,Guenter, Eureka! The hat goes on the head. It's all so obvious now!
Mars University,Leela," [shouting] Help us, Guenter!"
Mars University,Guenter," Oh, my goodness. [shouting] Hang on. I need to do some calculations. [He picks up the banana and draws some diagrams in the soft mud.] Got it! [He ties some vines around another log and pushes it into the river. He jumps onto it, floats down the river and throws the vine over an overhead branch. The other end dangles near the others.] Grab on!"
Mars University,Farnsworth, We're saved!
Mars University,Fry," 'Preciate it, Guenter!"
Mars University,Leela," Oh, no! Hurry, Guenter, climb up the vine. You can still save yourself."
Mars University,Guenter," Why bother? I've got nothing to live for. I was miserable as a genius, and as a monkey, I was so dumb I tried to wear a hat on my butt. [Fry chuckles.] [sadly] There's just no place for me in this world. [normal] Although, on the other hand--"
Mars University,Farnsworth," Oh, that poor, sweet monkey. Well, let's go gather him up. There's no sense letting him go to waste."
Mars University,Fry, Guenter! You're alive!
Mars University,Guenter, I guess the hat must have broke my fall.
Mars University,Farnsworth," It seems to be working at only half-capacity, but I can fix it."
Mars University,Guenter," No, wait! I like it like this. I actually feel sort of happy."
Mars University,Farnsworth, But what about your super-intelligence?
Mars University,Guenter, When I had that there was too much pressure to use it. All I want out of life is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit. That's why I've decided to transfer to business school!
Mars University,Farnsworth, [screaming] Nooo!
Mars University,Bender," [shouting] Come on, everyone! Big party in Robot House!"
Mars University,,
Fry Am the Egg Man,,
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," Run, Leela! They're bouncing right at us!"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Bender, So... Anybody hungry?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, I could stuff myself.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, I'll use that free app that tells you what restaurants you're near.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, You mean the window?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, Yes.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Lrrr," [angry] I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8! I demand extra dipping sauce!"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Teenaged Alien, How many?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Lrrr, [shy] Uh... Two.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fishy Joe, Welcome to Fishy Joe's. Today is Stroganoff Thursday. We are currently out of the following menu items.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Female voice, Stroganoff.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Teenaged Alien, May I take your order?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, I'll have the Stroganoff.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Teenaged Alien, Okay.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Bender," Yeah, uh, gimme the fried spaghetti dinner breakfast pocket for lunch an', uh, a big bucket o' mixed sodas."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Teenaged Alien, One kids meal. Got it.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, [off camera] Huh. Buggalo tots?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, What exactly are those made of?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Teenaged Alien, You got a warrant?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, I'll just have something from the lite menu. How about the gardener lover's salad?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Teenaged Alien, What kinda cheese fillin' you want in that?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, Ugh! Just gimme the fruit cup!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Teenaged Alien, Okey-doke. What kinda cheese fillin' you want in that?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela," Oh, God! Fruit is spelled F-R-O-O-T. And it's got quotation marks around it."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, Mmm. There's nothin' wrong with a little fast food once or twice a meal. Heart... Attack! I'm fine.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela," Oh! I got a bone in my fruit! That's it. From now on, we're not eating anything unless we know what it is an' where it's from. We're going to the local farmers market."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Bender," Aw, mom! Do we hafta?!"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, This is what I'm talkin' about! See all the dirt an' earwigs? That's the sign of healthy food.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Hydroponic farmer, You think that's healthy? Try this. I found it growin' at the bottom of my hamper.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, Mmm! So fresh an' musty!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Bulb, It's what I do.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Thog," Hello, tiny man. You want sample small-batch Amazonian maple syrup?"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, Sure. That's the kinda sap I like.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Thog, You the kind of sap I like.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, I'm scaroused!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Bender," Zuban tobacco?! The richest, most obnoxious kind! Listen, pal. I'm lookin' for a versatile smoke. One that's equally good in a crowded elevator or an audience with the Pope."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Moustached Alien," Forget the Pope, my friend. Smoke one of these and God himself will ask to be seated far away from you."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Bender, Ooh!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, Heirloom eggs?! That's so life-affirming! I'll bet you run your own hatchery. Just you and your wife... Matilda.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Brown-haired man," No, ma'am. Matilda an' I gather them eggs in the forest. And Matilda's really more of a mongoose than a wife."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, You're a lucky man. But are they way more expensive than regular eggs?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Brown-haired Man, Way more.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, Ooh! I'll take a dozen.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Farnsworth, Wha?! You're not my breakfast friends! What are you doing here?!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Amy," Leela blackmailed us all into eating healthy, organic food."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Farnsworth, Blackmail? What does she have on you?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Hermes," As long as we eat 'er filthy scrambled eggs, you'll never find out."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela," They're not filthy! They're wholesome, fertile, and fresh from the forest floor. There's some filth."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, FERTILE? What does that mean?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Zoidberg," It means it'll hatch into a tiny, little infant creature. Unless we cook it first. Hey, Leela! Hurry up with those scrambled infants!"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," What?! That's horrifying! Zoidberg, you're an in-Human monster."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Zoidberg, What are you? My driver's license?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," Eating a sweet, innocent chick before it's even hatched?! Oh-ho-ho-ho, no, you won'tn't! I refuse to eat an unborn animal! I'm gonna keep this egg safe and warm and secure. Until it hatches out into the world. And then I'm gonna eat it!"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, Should we turn on the TV?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Hermes, Nah.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," Bender, d'you mind? I'm roosting."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Bender, I'm considerin' buyin' a yacht to house my Thoroughbreds. How d'you expect me to do that without smokin' a cigar?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, Think of the unborn embryo!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Bender, That's what I'm gonna call the yacht. Stop pickin' me! Whoa!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," Hey! Leggo my egg-o, crab-o!"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Hermes," Stop it, Fry! That's sexual harassment!"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Zoidberg," Yeah, come down off your round, white pulpit! You're just gonna eat that thing, anyway!"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," I was, but you can't sit on something for a week without falling in love with it. Whoever's in here deserves a chance at life. A chance to blossom into a beautiful young man. Like I did as a baby. And so I make this solemn vow... To do everything I can to make sure this wonderful, innocent creature enters this world happy, healthy, an'— All yours, Zoidberg."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Bender," Aw! Look at the cute, little— I was gonna go yachting in those feet!"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela," Relax, you babies. It's no different from stomping a puppy."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, Everyone stop! He's not gonna hurt you.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Bender, I'm standin' in a pool of my own feet!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Hermes, Bender's right! Kill it before someone names it!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, No! Mr. Peppy just wants to be our friend.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Hermes, Oy!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," Look  I know 'e's ugly and kinda corrosive, but we can't murder someone just 'cause he's hideous an' annoying."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Amy, That's what we said about Zoidberg and look what that got us.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Zoidberg, Amy has a point.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, Mr. Peppy's not like Zoidberg. He's my friend.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Zoidberg, Aw!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Calculon, Where to... Adulterers?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Monique, Calculon?! Then it wasn't your body they found in the harbor after the bomb went off.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Calculon, What bomb?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Bender," It takes more than that to surprise me, Bender. [Mr. Peppy, who has gotten bigger, suddenly appears. Bender screams, scared.] What you doin', little buddy? Uh, yeah... Uncle Bender... He's your friend. [Mr. Peppy stands up, which scares Bender even more. Bender screams effeminately as Mr. Peppy faces him with an angry look. Mr. Peppy then vomits a tennis ball on the couch.] Huh? Oh, you wanna play fetch! [Bender grabs the ball and Mr. Peppy begins panting and wagging his tail.] Come on, boy! Get the ball. [Bender pretends to throw the ball, making a barking Mr. Peppy run, only to find nothing, and laughs.] Dumb jerk. Come on! Get the ball."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Hermes, Sweet freak of Mozambique! That thing's colossal! It's gonna kill us all!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Amy, It's so huge! How big does one o' those things get?!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," Well, that depends on what one o' those things is. That seems like a fact worth knowing."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Farnsworth," Good, startling news, everyone!"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Farnsworth, I found a description of the creature in this medieval monster manual. Just as I feared. Attack type J.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Amy, No! [extendedly] No!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Farnsworth," [extendedly] Yes! [back to normal] It kills its prey by sucking out the skeleton, leaving nothing but a puddle of flesh."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Amy, Ew!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, Ugh!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Bender, Ew!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Farnsworth," Hence the Latin name bonus vampirus. Or, as you non-Catholics would say, the bone vampire!"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Zoidberg, Dios mío.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, That's ridiculous. Mr. Peppy doesn't eat bones. I raised 'im on a simple diet o' Brussels sprouts an' mixed soda.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Hermes, At least there's only one of 'em. The good news is they can't start breedin'.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Farnsworth," The bad news, everyone, is the beast reproduces asexually. A single bone vampire, left alone with some quiet music and some bone-vampire porn, could produce dozens of deadly offspring."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Zoidberg, That lucky bastard. I say kill it!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, But it loves me! And I love it.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Zoidberg, Kill 'em both!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, Killing them seems like a hassle. Can't we just set it free to live with its own kind?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Farnsworth," Poor, ignorant Leela. The bone vampire is now extinct on its home planet."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, That's perfect! We can reintroduce it to the wild and repopulate the species!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, Yeah! Let's do those Leela things.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," Well, buddy, how d'ya like your new home? See? He's happy already."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Hermes," That thing doesn't have emotions, Fry. Its brain is the size of a walnut."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," So are walnuts and they're delicious. I'll miss you, Mr. Peppy. But you'll be happier here. So... Go on. Go. Goodbye, Mr. Peppy. Come on, man. Don't do this. Go on now. I mean it. Don't make this any harder than it has to be. It's time to let go! Ow! Thanks, Leela. He just needed a little extra push."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela," Come on, Fry. Let's go home an'—"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Bender," Hold up! There's alcohol around here somewhere. My Tanqueray-dar is goin' crazy. Aha-ha! Thought you could get away from me, huh? You lose again, you stupid intoxicant!"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Zoidberg, We're not from around here. Hello!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Man #1, [says something in Gaelic]
Fry Am the Egg Man,Hermes," Excuse me, but we're guests on your planet. Speak English!"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Man #2," Behave yourselves, gents. Off-worlders best be welcome here. Especially if we're trying to get the Olympics. May I buy you a drink? We don't get a lot of pretty faces around here."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, Uh... Sure. But I'm driving. I'll just have the smallest whisky you've got.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Man #2, A small aquarium o' whisky for the busty lass!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, Thanks. I suppose I should know your name if I'm gonna be drinking ten gallons of alcohol with you.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Man #2, McZongo. Angus McZongo. Major Angus McZongo. Handsome Major Angus McZongo. Esquire.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, Ooh! Handsome and esquire. I'm Turanga Leela. My crew an' I are from Earth.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Angus McZongo, So what brings you folks here to Doohan 6?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Amy, We just released an endangered animal back into the wild. A bone vampire!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Hermes, No need to thank us. Your shocked stares of gratitude say it all.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Angus McZongo, Dear God. You brought back the bone vampire?! The damn things wreaked bloody havoc on our livestock for centuries!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Woman," Aye! Until McZongo 'ere shot 'em all into extinction, 'e did."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Man #3," Now we've got more livestock than we can slaughter. Oh, aye. 'Tis a Bonnie time to be an ignorant villager."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Man #4, We kinna have no murderin' bone vampires back 'ere!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Man #3, Kill it afore it puts a bun in its own oven and repopulates the bleedin' planet!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, No!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Angus McZongo, Angus is right.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Hermes, I thought you were named Angus.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Man #1, We're all named Angus!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, Please! Mr. Peppy won't attack your livestock. He's a vegetarian and 'e's not even preachy about it!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Angus McZongo," Poppycock. Once he gets the smell o' bones, there'll be no stoppin' 'im. Tonight, Mr. Peppy must die."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela," Angus, wait. My strictly platonic friend is right. At least wait a few days before you decide to kill it."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Angus McZongo," The last time I hesitated, a bone vampire snicked out me left shin."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, Please! Just a few days.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Angus McZongo," Well, 'twould give us a chance to get to know each other. The beast lives! For now."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela," Thank you, Angus."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Men, [in unison] You're welcome!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, I don't trust that McZongo. Maybe I should go keep an eye on Mr. Peppy.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, Don't worry about McZongo. He an' I are having brunch tomorrow. I'm thinking of wearing this.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, It's nice! But there's still somethin' I don't like about that guy. My dad always said you could tell a lot about a man by the rigidity of 'is shins.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Zoidberg, What is?!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Man #1," UNKNOWN, Gryffindor, Slytherin an' Hufflepuff! It killed Little Angus!"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Farnsworth, They're all dead! And their bones are gone! This was no accident.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Angus McZongo," Still think your Mr. Peppy is harmless, Fry?"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," He wouldn't do this in our sleep. He would not, could not to a sheep."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Angus McZongo, The deal is off! The beast must die!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Bender, Ooh! Pimpy!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, What are we supposed to do? Just sit here and wait for Mr. Peppy to be killed?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Bender, Sounds like a plan! Guess I'll pass the time by lightin' up an El Jerko!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, Okay! That's it! I need some air.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela," Who's there? Hermes, is this one o' your zany practical jokes?"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," Leela, are you okay? Did you drink too many aquaria?"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Hermes, Look! The bone vampire!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, Mr. Peppy attacked me. Quick! Count my bones. There should be two-hundred-and-five!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, Okay. That's better. Keep 'em comin'!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Farnsworth," I'm sorry, Fry, but no vegetarian could've done this."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," I know. An', as much as I love Mr. Peppy, I love Leela more. He has to be... Put down."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Amy," Aw, don't feel bad. Major McZongo's an experienced hunter. He'll blow Mr. Peppy's head off as painlessly as possible."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," No! Not McZongo! If anyone's gonna kill Mr. Peppy, it should be me."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Zoidberg," Fry, I know you're upset right now, but I hope you'll consider donating the body to science dinner."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," Here, Mr. Peppy. Mmm. Lovely bones."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Hermes, We've been walkin' for hours. I hope we can find our way back.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Amy, Don't worry. I left a trail of bread crumbs.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Bender, An' I left a trail of cigars!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela," You don't have to do this, Fry. Mr. Peppy just gave me a little love concussion."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," Thanks, Leela, but I have no choice. I can't let my monstruous deboner get anywhere near you."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Hermes, There it is!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," Well, this is it. You guys wait here. This is gonna kill him more than it does me. Goodbye, boy. I'll think of you whenever I sit on something round."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Amy, What's happening?! Did you kill it?!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Mr. Peppy, The bloody idiot bloody-shot me! I'm all bloody-bloody!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Bender, Wha?!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, Mr. Peppy?! Bullets make you talk?!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Bender, That's not Mr. Peppy!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Amy, Jinkies! He Scooby-Doo-ed us!
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela," Why, Major McZongo? Why?"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Angus McZongo," Oh, it's been thirty years since last I killed a bone vampire. The villagers dinna idolise me like they used to."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Amy, You seem pretty popular at the pub.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Angus McZongo, I work there as a greeter! Your beast was my chance to be a hero again. But the damn thing was a vegetarian! So I slaughtered the sheep meself.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, But why did you attack me?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Angus McZongo," So I could impress you by seeking revenge on the creature. Us greeters don't get a lot of action. On paper, it seemed like a win-win situation."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Farnsworth," Do you realise what this means, Fry?! Your pet's not dangerous after all!"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," I told ya! Mr. Peppy's a lover, not a fighter. Like Dwayne ""The Rock"" ""The Tooth Fairy"" Johnson."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Zoidberg, UNKNOWN! Hey. What's that bone-sucking sound?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, It's Mr. Peppy! I'd know 'im anywhere.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela," Huh. So, apparently, Major McZongo and Mr. Peppy were each doing about half the sheep killing."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," Why, Mr. Peppy? Why? Ooh. That tickles. Now I really do have to kill you."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Man #3," Wait! Don't shoot. The beast is a godsend. Like I said, we've more livestock than we can slaughter. But, thanks to this ravenous bogle, that's nae more a problem."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Man #5," Angus is right. The cursed thing even debones 'em. Which is perfect for today's fast-paced, lazy consumer."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Man #1," Dersu Uzala, Yojimbo, Rashomon! The beast must live!"
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela," You know what the best part is? From now on, whenever we're eating fresh, organic space meat, we'll know exactly where it comes from."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry," One bucket o' double-friend, triple-salted, boneless sheep tots, please."
Fry Am the Egg Man,Teenaged Alien, What kinda cheese fillin' you want in that?
Fry Am the Egg Man,Fry, All kinds.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, Eh... Make it two.
Fry Am the Egg Man,Leela, [over credits] An' a small whisky. Large.
Fry Am the Egg Man,,
All the Presidents' Heads,,
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Remember when you asked to see my family tree?"
All the Presidents' Heads,"Leela, Bender, Zoidberg, Hermes, Amy, and Fry", No.
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," Ta-da! [Professor Farnsworth activates the holographic projector. The holographic projector shows a tree filled with spheres. Professor Farnsworth touches one of the spheres.] This is my ancestor Philo Farnsworth, inventor of television and, as a bonus, childhood obesity. [The sphere enlarges and shows a television screen depicting a man who resembles Professor Farnsworth. Professor Farnsworth touches another sphere.] And here's Dean Farnsworth, developer of the Farnsworth test for colour blindness. [The sphere enlarges and shows a set of coloured balls depicting another man who resembles Professor Farnsworth. Professor Farnsworth adjusts his glasses.] Where is he, blast it?! [Professor Farnsworth touches a third sphere.] And, just recently, I learned of a modern-day Farnsworth, who invented the anti-senility truss."
All the Presidents' Heads,Leela," That's you, Professor."
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," Wha?! [Professor Farnsworth's belly enlarges until his sweater and his pants are separated. Professor Farnsworth is wearing a metallic truss. The metallic truss unleashes several sparks. Professor Farnsworth adjusts his clothes.] Ah, yes. The Farnsworths boast a proud and distinguished lineage. No wormy fruit on this tree."
All the Presidents' Heads,Amy, What about Fry? [Fry is snoring.] Isn't he your distant uncle?
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," Very distant. Not a true Farnsworth, mind you. [A fourth sphere shows Fry. The sphere's branch is filled with fungus and dung beetles.] He's way over here on this filthy branch riddled with fungus and dung beetles."
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry, What's with the seventeen dung beetles?
All the Presidents' Heads,Hermes," Well, it's six o'clock. [Hermes removes the hat from the hanger and puts it on.] I guess we'll have to deliver that Human heart tomorrow. Good work, people!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender," Woohoo! Time to go clubbin'. [With his right hand, Bender opens his chest cabinet and grabs a baseball bat. Bender's chest cabinet closes itself.] Baby seals, here I come."
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry, Guess I better head over to my night job.
All the Presidents' Heads,Leela, You have a night job?
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry," Yup. It's exhausting, but I need the extra money to buy coffee so I can stay awake for my night job."
All the Presidents' Heads,Leela, But—
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry, Gotta go!
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry, [extendedly] Woo!
All the Presidents' Heads,Dr. Cahill," You've got a surprising amount of algae in your beard, Mr. President. Just sit still and let the algae eater do its work."
All the Presidents' Heads,Abraham Lincoln's head, Ooh! Ow! [The algae eater bites Abraham Lincoln's mole.] Ooh! Lay off my trademark mole.
All the Presidents' Heads,Dr. Cahill," Hi, Lars."
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry, Fry.
All the Presidents' Heads,Dr. Cahill," Whatever. [Dr. Cahill opens and closes the purse.] I'm heading out to my night job. [Dr. Cahill walks up to the door.] Remember  No loud noise, no head bowling, and no parties. Or it'll be your ass in a jar!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry, I wanna go to that museum!
All the Presidents' Heads,Bill Clinton's head," Man, this place is a snooze. Hey, Fry, I challenge President Taft 'ere to a pie-eatin' contest."
All the Presidents' Heads,William Taft's head," You're on, skinny!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry," Sorry, guys. You know the rules. ""No fun allowed."""
All the Presidents' Heads,Andrew Jackson's head," Come on, you pansy! I'm thirsty. I want me some Tennessee loopy juice!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Warren Harding's head, And I want loose women. The kind that aren't afraid to show a little ankle.
All the Presidents' Heads,James Madison's head, [creepily] Or elbow.
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry, No visitors! I'll lose my job.
All the Presidents' Heads,Rutherford B. Hayes' head," Oh, boo-hoo! I'll lose my minimum-wage job."
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry," You're mean, Rutherford B. Hayes!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Franklin D. Roosevelt's head," Listen here, young man! We have nothing to fear but running out of beer."
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry, Alright. One small get-together. But let's keep it quiet and dignified.
All the Presidents' Heads,Zoidberg, [quickly] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender," Woohoo! Yeah, alright!"
All the Presidents' Heads,"Scruffy, Leela, Hermes, and Bender", Four more beers! Four more beers!
All the Presidents' Heads,Amy, Yes! Right in the ike!
All the Presidents' Heads,James Madison's head, [creepily] Nice elbow action.
All the Presidents' Heads,Hermes, So... You grow hemp?
All the Presidents' Heads,Thomas Jefferson's head, Yes.
All the Presidents' Heads,Hermes, And... You do what with it?
All the Presidents' Heads,Thomas Jefferson's head," All manner of things. Manufacture paper, fabric, rope..."
All the Presidents' Heads,Hermes," Oh. Well, nice talking to you."
All the Presidents' Heads,Thomas Jefferson's head," Why, I used to smoke about four feet of rope a day."
All the Presidents' Heads,Hermes, Let me give you my pager number.
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," Hey, Reagan. Remember when you asked to see my family tree?"
All the Presidents' Heads,Ronald Reagan's head, I asked you to leave me alone.
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, The Farnsworths are a remarkable—
All the Presidents' Heads,George Washington's head, [off camera] Farnsworth?! [The camera pans over to George Washington's head. George Washington's head spits in his jar's glass.] That name is a stain on American history! One of the worst traitors of the Revolution was a Farnsworth!
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, You're lying!
All the Presidents' Heads,Leela, [whispering] He's George Washington! He tends not to do that!
All the Presidents' Heads,George Washington's head, David Farnsworth was a notorious British agent and counterfeiter. [The camera zooms in on George Washington's head.] He conspired to bring down our nation with his fraudulent currency.
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," A Farnsworth did this?! [Professor Farnsworth holds the piece of paper with his right hand and puts his left hand on his head.] Oh, dear! My good name is ruined!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Gerald Ford's head, Hi! I'm Jerry. I like movies.
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender," Anyone seen Ulysses Grant? [Leela opens her eyes, looking at Bender.] He owes me a cheroot."
All the Presidents' Heads,Leela," He's over there, pukin' in the Bushes."
All the Presidents' Heads,George H. W. Bush's head and George W. Bush's head, [extendedly] No!
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry," Oh, boy."
All the Presidents' Heads,Dr. Cahill, [angry] Mr. Fry! [Dr. Cahill uncrosses her arms and walks up to Fry as she looks around.] Why are all these people standing around? [Dr. Cahill grabs a bottle of beer with her right hand and throws the set of paper sheets away with her left hand.] [happy] When they should be partying!
All the Presidents' Heads,"Amy, Bender, and Hermes", Alright!
All the Presidents' Heads,Zoidberg," Hey, hey, LBJ. You wanna get drunk?"
All the Presidents' Heads,Lyndon Johnson's head," Oh, hell, yeah. [Zoidberg begins drinking the water in Lyndon Johnson's jar.] Whoa!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," Zoidberg, no! [Professor Farnsworth and Amy run towards Zoidberg.] The effects of jar juice aren't fully understood!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Zoidberg, Uh... Not bad. A hint of vitalis and—
All the Presidents' Heads,Amy," I recognise this! [The camera zooms out, revealing Professor Farnsworth to be barefoot.] It's the 1960s! [Zoidberg touches Professor Farnsworth's beard. Professor Farnsworth looks angry and moves away from Zoidberg.] I did a report on it for my drug-taking class."
All the Presidents' Heads,Blond man, Hi. I'm Andy Warhol and you're some kind of... Marvellous lobster man.
All the Presidents' Heads,Zoidberg," Right on! Say, you got any real soup or just this schlock?"
All the Presidents' Heads,Andy Warhol, What a horrid bore.
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, Ooh.
All the Presidents' Heads,Amy, Wha?
All the Presidents' Heads,Zoidberg, Far out! That head gave me a total head trip!
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry, Really?! [The camera pans over to a shelf.] I'm gonna lick Herbert Hoover's head!
All the Presidents' Heads,"Zoidberg, Leela, Amy, Hermes, and several heads", Lick the head! [Bender has picked up Herbert Hoover's head and is holding it in front of Fry.] Lick the head!
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender," Whoa! A speakeasy. [Bender raises his right hand, then raises his left hand, and puts both his hands on the counter.] One prohibited beverage, please."
All the Presidents' Heads,Bartender," Hey, Dutch. The new still is here."
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender, I'm not a still! [The bartender turns to Bender. Bender points at himself with his right hand and puts his right hand back on the table.] I just smell like one!
All the Presidents' Heads,Male voice," Dutch Schultz, come out with your bootleg whisky. We're thirsty!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Hermes," What the heck is goin' on?! Jefferson, did you sell me some bad rope?!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," It must have something to do with the jar fluid. [Professor Farnsworth puts his left hand in Thomas Jefferson's jar, takes it out, and smells it.] Aha! [Professor Farnsworth turns to Dr. Cahill.] Dr. Cahill, do I detect a trace of opal essence?"
All the Presidents' Heads,Dr. Cahill," Very observant, Professor. To preserve the heads, we use a rare form of powdered crystalline opal. [Dr. Cahill opens a safe and grabs a test tube filled with powdered crystalline opal with her right hand.] This is the world's entire supply. [Dr. Cahill holds the test tube with her left hand.] Yet it's so powerful, it should last a thousand years. It keeps the heads alive, but... We don't know how."
All the Presidents' Heads,Amy, Why did it give us those hallucinations?
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, Because it didn't!
All the Presidents' Heads,Amy, Uh... Yuh-huh!
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," Opal has unusual temporal properties. [Professor Farnsworth turns to the others and illustrates the situation with both his hands.] It preserves each head in a time-stasis bubble. Ergo, licking those heads actually sent us back in time to their original eras. [Professor Farnsworth points at a painting on the wall resembling Shot Marilyns that bears Zoidberg's face instead of Marilyn Monroe's. To its left, there is a sign reading UNWELCOME GUEST - 1968.] Look!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Zoidberg, Fuh! Schlock and more schlock!
All the Presidents' Heads,Dutch Schultz, Pssst! Is the coast clear?
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender," Button your yap, you mug!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, I've discovered a new means of time travel! I'll call it the Farnsworth effect!
All the Presidents' Heads,George Washington's head, Nice try. [Professor Farnsworth looks at George Washington's head.] But even this discovery won't undo the treachery wrought by your nefarious ancestor David Farnsworth.
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, It will if we go back in time and stop him!
All the Presidents' Heads,Leela," Professor, no! [Leela and Fry run towards Professor Farnsworth and hold him. Bender runs towards George Washington's head and removes his jar from Professor Farnsworth's hands.] You can't tongue the father of our country!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry," Where are we? Also, when are we?"
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," 68th and Broadway, colonial era. [A cowbell-ringing sound is heard and a cow is seen. The cow moos.] Rush hour."
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," By my calculations, this head trip will last, at most, 24 hours. We need to stop that monster, David Farnsworth!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Leela," Look at the date on this newspaper. [She picks it up and reads it.] April 17th, 1775."
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," Say, on this exact date, the Continental Congress was meeting secretly in New York. Maybe they can help us."
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender, But they could be meetin' anywhere!  What are we gonna do? Search building to building?
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, [pointing to the building on the left] We'll start with that one.
All the Presidents' Heads,Thomas Jefferson," Alexander Hamilton of New York, how say you?"
All the Presidents' Heads,Alexander Hamilton, Nay.
All the Presidents' Heads,Thomas Jefferson, John Hancock and John Adams of Massachusetts?
All the Presidents' Heads,John Adams, Yay.
All the Presidents' Heads,John Hancock, Yay.
All the Presidents' Heads,Thomas Jefferson, [dips his quill in ink and starts writing something] The yay's have it. Our nation's official joke state shall be New Jersey. [A knock on the door is heard] Uh-oh. [Jefferson crumples up the paper and puts it in his mouth and swallows it.]
All the Presidents' Heads,John Adams," Ah, 'tis just our new Crockpot."
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender," Watch it, Wiggy! I ain't no stinking crock!"
All the Presidents' Heads,John Adams, We'll see about that in five hours. [He puts a raw chicken in Bender's chest cabinet.]
All the Presidents' Heads,John Hancock," Halt! From whence commeth thou, one-eyed maiden!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Leela," Uh, ever been to Peru?"
All the Presidents' Heads,John Hancock, Certainly not!
All the Presidents' Heads,Leela, [pushing down Hancock's musket so she can get through] I'm from Peru.
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," Clam up, founding fathers! We need help locating the treacherous forger [takes out the counterfeit currency] who forged this forgery!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Thomas Jefferson," [takes the counterfeit] My word! If these enter circulation, our economy will be destroyed! And with it, our chance at independence!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Alexander Hamilton," [taking the counterfeit from Jefferson] Only one man in the colonies has a printing press fine enough to make these. Our good friend, Ben Franklin."
All the Presidents' Heads,Leela, Uh-oh. Isn't Franklin in Philadelphia?
All the Presidents' Heads,Thomas Jefferson," When he's not in Charlotte, or Maribel, or Louisa!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry, I don't get it.
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," I'm sure no one's ever said this before, but I must get to Philadelphia as quickly as possible!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, Oh! Why couldn't my disgraced ancestor have lived in the NASCAR era?!
All the Presidents' Heads,Woman," Dr. Franklin, your new steam engine is here."
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender, I ain't no stinkin' steam engine! [a bell dings] Chicken's ready.
All the Presidents' Heads,Benjamin Franklin," You may go, Louisa."
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry, [leaning into the frame] Now I get it!
All the Presidents' Heads,Benjamin Franklin, Fascinating. Be you man or machine?
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender, Mostly machine. Might be a couple dead cats in there.
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," Dr. Franklin, with all due respect to the brilliant inventor of the... [motions toward the device behind him] stove, I must speak with you. [walks toward Franklin, who has a chicken leg in his mouth] I'm looking for the scoundrel who made [takes out the counterfeit again] this!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Benjamin Franklin," [takes the counterfeit and inspects it] Intricate filigree, satanic symbols, looks like one of mine. [looks closer at it and gasps] But no! This is a fake!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry," Duh! It says [points to the words on the currency] ""Colony of Maffachufetts""!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender," [scoffs] More like ""Taxachufetts""!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Benjamin Franklin," [sighs] That's just how we print S's, you ""ƒtupid ƒhitheads""! Someone must've used my press while I was poking around in Charlotte. Let's ask my apprentice, David Farnsworth."
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, [gasps] Farnsworth?!! That's him! Arm yourselves!
All the Presidents' Heads,Benjamin Franklin," I call it ""the Franklinator""."
All the Presidents' Heads,Benjamin Franklin, The apprentice's suite is empty! He's gone!
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, Wait! What's that glistening in the chamber pot?
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender, [walking toward the chair] Let's find out.
All the Presidents' Heads,Leela," Bender, do you know what a chamber pot is?"
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender, I don't know and I don't care!
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, A Massachusetts hapenny?
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender," Probably fake, too. There's one way to find out. [Bender takes the hapenny, opens his teeth to bend the coin and the others, beside Farnsworth, look in disgust.] What?"
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry, Bender bent a poo penny! Bender bent a poo penny!
All the Presidents' Heads,Benjamin Franklin, Look! 'Tis but worthless tin!
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, Where could Farnsworth have minted such a high quality fake?
All the Presidents' Heads,Benjamin Franklin," Not here. But, you know, I have a friend in Boston who's an expert silversmith. They could be connected. [brief pause] There's only like forty people who do anything around here."
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," But Boston's 300 miles away and Bender kicked our horse to death! We'll never get there in time! Unless you have another ""invention"" up your sleeve! Foh!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Benjamin Franklin, [thinks] Hmmm...
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender, How's this going to get us to Boston?
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender, Stupid Franklin— [lightning shocks him again as he runs faster]
All the Presidents' Heads,Paul Revere," Ah, that scrap metal I ordered is here."
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender, I'm 40% scrap metal. [bangs his chest and walks inside]
All the Presidents' Heads,Paul Revere," Well, Ben Franklin, [shakes Franklin's hand] my fellow Son of Liber— [notices a couple of redcoats outside] Tea kettles, heh. Yes, I've made some new tea kettles. Perfect for special occasions. Like hanging King George in effigy— [Franklin motions Revere to calm down because of the redcoats again] and H and I are monograms you can put on those tea kettles. [one of the redcoats notices Revere speaking strangly] Whatta you looking at, you British bastards?!?!?!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Benjamin Franklin," [pushing Revere inside as the others follow him] Paul, we talked about this."
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," Mr. Revere, we're looking for a counterfeiter who minted [gives Revere the fake coins] these smelly hapennies. His name is David Farnsworth."
All the Presidents' Heads,Paul Revere, [inspecting the fakes] Farnsworth? I just hired him for the fall candlestick rush. He's in the foundry this very moment!
All the Presidents' Heads,Benjamin Franklin, [holding a sack of Franklinators] Everybody take a Franklinator.
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry," Aw, I gotta chipmunk."
All the Presidents' Heads,Leela, [kicking the door down] Hee-ya!
All the Presidents' Heads,Professor Farnsoworth," David Farnsworth, I presume?"
All the Presidents' Heads,David Farnsworth, [in an indistinguishable British accent] I'm David Farnsworth.
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, Fuff! You're a disgrace to the very name Fowvwuh!
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry, Look out! He's got a bezeling planisher!
All the Presidents' Heads,David Farnsworth, 'At's right! 'Oo wonts ta be bezel'd?!
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender," You idiot, I'm not a cannon!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender," Oh, I guess I am a cannon."
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, Time to prune the family tree! [He knocks out his ancestor unconscious with a candlestick. Everybody cheers.] Huzzah! I've saved the Farnsworth name!
All the Presidents' Heads,Man, An urgent message for Mr. Revere!
All the Presidents' Heads,Paul Revere," Mr. Revere, pray, do not 'ƒhit' your pants. The British attack has begun. Cross the river and watch for my signal. [Revere finishes reading the letter.] I must ride."
All the Presidents' Heads,Leela, He has so much stuff. [Leela puts a set of tableware into a seemingly bottomless purse.] He won't miss this.
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, Let's burn these counterfeits and paddle the next swan boat the hell out of Boston.
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry, Here you go.
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," Thanks. [The Professor throws the lantern onto the pile, causing it to shatter. The counterfeits start burning.] Say, where did you get that lantern?"
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry," From that old church to the north. [Fry points to a church.] They had two burning, so I figured they wouldn't miss one."
All the Presidents' Heads,Paul Revere, One if by land. Two if by sea. [Revere stops by a river and sees one lantern hanging on the wall of the church.] [shouting] The British are coming! The British are coming! [Revere goes back to riding the horse.] [shouting] By land! By land! [whispering] Gotta treat this OCD. Gotta treat this OCD.
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," Fry, you dope! You've really screwed the granny this time! History needed that second lantern!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Leela, We better stop Paul Revere before—
All the Presidents' Heads,Leela," [in a British accent] I guess everything worked out jolly oll right, eh, guv'nor?"
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender," [laughing, in a Cockney accent] Wot's with th' fruity accent, ducky? Bollocks! Ah've got it, too!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry," [in a British accent] Where's all th' Presidents' heads, then?"
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," [in a British accent] Ah say, appears we've changed 'istory too much, disahster of nightmarish proportions an' wotnot. [smokes a pipe calmly as a dramatic musical sting is heard] Quite."
All the Presidents' Heads,Hermes," Where 'ave you blokes been? [cut to a shot of Hermes now wearing a shirt that says ""Manchester United""] You nearly missed elevenses."
All the Presidents' Heads,Amy, [wearing a hat and elegant clothing and carrying a tray of tea and other delicacies] Who's for tea and shmavories?
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender, Wot in bloody 'ell's goin' on aroun' 'ere ah says?
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, Indeed. Wot's become of the dear old USA?
All the Presidents' Heads,Amy, Beg pardon?
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, The Revolution? 1776 and wot all?
All the Presidents' Heads,Hermes," Oh, the Colonial Desktop(?).  Well, there's nuthin' we Brits enjoy more dan a good document'ry. Turn on the televiser, Dr. Zoidsmythe."
All the Presidents' Heads,Zoidsmythe," I'll dial up the Beeb. They've always got a nice doccy-woccy on. [He turns on the TV, which shows the continent of North America, which is filled in by the Union Jack.]"
All the Presidents' Heads,Narrator," The Vanquished Pride of the Yankees, [Zoidsmythe silly walks away] or [reading the title] America the Dutiful! [During the speech, several images are shown, including the Liberty Bell, which is now the Tyranny Bell, the Lincoln Memorial statue, now the Hitchcock Memorial and surrounded by birds, and a Dunkin' Donuts, now Dunkin' Crumpets.] North America or Wes' Britannia as we now call it, has been under British rule for fourteen-hundred years... [An arm pulls down a screen showing a scene not unlike Terry Gilliam's animations from Monty Python.] all thanks to a nutter known as ""Wrong Way Revere""."
All the Presidents' Heads,Animated Revere," The British are coming, by land, by land! Heh heh heh heh!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Narrator," But we came by sea, we did. Surprised the Yanks at Lexington ending the Rebellion with narry a kipper scuffed."
All the Presidents' Heads,Amy," Scuffed kippers, anyone?"
All the Presidents' Heads,Zoidsmythe," Right kind of you, mum. [gobbles all the fish in Zoidbergian fashion]"
All the Presidents' Heads,Narrator," The humiliated conspirators were forced to sign the Declaration of Dependence, proclaiming British rule forever. [Cut to George Washington's bedroom, Washington is seen sleeping in his bed when his door opens.] Meanwhile, a loyal Brit by the name of David Farnsworth tracked down the traitor George Washington and bravely smothered him with his wig. [David Farnsworth covers Washington with his wig, Washington's screams are muffled.]"
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," Oh, criminy!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Narrator," In gratitude, King George named Farnsworth a duke and granted his family massive land holdings in the colonies."
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, Blimey. I've never felt so ashamed to be a Farnsworth.
All the Presidents' Heads,Scruffy, Will m'lord be returning to his massive land holdings for luncheon?
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, Huh-woh?
All the Presidents' Heads,Leela, [yawns] I know we're ladies-in-waiting but what are we waiting for?
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, How should I know? Just shut up and wait!
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender," [he is looking out a window, his back turned to the camera] Say, how is it that we've got socialized medicine [turns around to reveal his dental problems] bot me teeth still loo' like this?"
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry, Con't we just go back in time an' set things roight again?
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, Don't want to. Rather nice living under the crown and so forth.
All the Presidents' Heads,Zoidsmythe, [being used as a footstool by Farnsworth] Rather. [Farnsworth whips Zoidsmythe with his cane]
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," Wot's more, couldn't go back even if we wonted to.  No more crystalline opal left in all the world, don't you know."
All the Presidents' Heads,Scruffy," M'lord, the Queen is here for 'er, eh, weekly, irrrrr, visit."
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, The Queen? Sounds most satisfactory. All of you out!
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender," [sighs, and exits with the others] Right, then. Let's go play some quoits...wotever that is."
All the Presidents' Heads,Squire," Presenting the Queen of England, America, and two parking spaces in Tokyo."
All the Presidents' Heads,Queen, Where's me consort at?
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, [gulps] C-C-Consort?
All the Presidents' Heads,Queen," That's right, luv. Fer cent'ries, a Farnsworth gentleman 'as provided service to the Queen. Now close yer eyes an' think of England!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," Ah say, what's that in your crown?"
All the Presidents' Heads,Queen," You mean Andamooka Opal? Why, it's th' most precious gem in all th'— [Farnsworth raises his cane]"
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender, Yes! Three rubbers on the hob!
All the Presidents' Heads,Queen, Stop him! He crowned me in th' knickers an' nicked me crown!
All the Presidents' Heads,Smitty, Freeze or we'll be forced to continue chasing you since we don't carry guns!
All the Presidents' Heads,URL, Indubitably.
All the Presidents' Heads,Leela, We've got to go back in toime an' set things straight! 'Urry up an' lick Washin'ton's 'ead again!
All the Presidents' Heads,Bender, We can't! There's no George Washington nor any other Presidents.
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry, [pointing somewhere] Wot about this bloke?  'e's from Revolutionary times.
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, Farnsworth!
All the Presidents' Heads,David Farsnworth's head," Hey! Yer the plaunkers wot candlesticked me! Well, ah showed you! Ah killed George Washin'ton an' now I'm married to one of the Spice Girls! Don't rightly know which one."
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," Bender, fetch me that powdered opal!"
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth, It's time to restore dignity to the Farnsworth name!
All the Presidents' Heads,Fry," [speaking in his normal voice] There. That time, I left both lanterns in place."
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," [speaking in his normal voice] And I hit Farnsworth much, much harder. Eh, perhaps too hard."
All the Presidents' Heads,Leela, [speaking in her normal voice] Look! All the Presidents are back! Even John Tyler!
All the Presidents' Heads,John Tyler's head, That's the first time anyone's spoken to me in twelve-hundred years.
All the Presidents' Heads,Farnsworth," Yes, from Chester A. Arthur to Chester Z. Arthur, they're all here. Our republic and the Farnsworth family name are saved. [walks away] And no one will ever know."
All the Presidents' Heads,,
Cold Warriors,,
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr," Double time, soldier. [Yancy Fry Sr points at the shack, which has a US flag on it, with his left hand.] I want this ice-fishin' operation up and runnin' by oh-eight-hundred hours."
Cold Warriors,Fry," It's too cold, Dad. My teen region is freezing off."
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr," You dunno what cold is. [Fry reaches Yancy Fry Sr. Yancy Fry Sr uncrosses his arms, turns to his left, and resumes walking.] I once survived an entire week trapped in a Swiss glacier, eatin' nothin' but frozen Neanderthal. [Yancy Fry Sr turns to Fry.] To this day, I can't stand the taste of early hominid."
Cold Warriors,Fry, Let's just get inside the shack.
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr," Hold, maggot!"
Cold Warriors,Fry, Ow!
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr," Remember the code o' the ice! Thick an' blue, tried an' true. Thin an' crispy, way too risky."
Cold Warriors,Fry," Shows what you know. [Fry turns forward and resumes walking.] Crispy doesn't even rhyme with risky. [Fry falls through the ice, screams, and resurfaces.] Help! I'm drowning!"
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr," [calm] Don't worry, son. [Fry resurfaces.] You'll freeze before you drown."
Cold Warriors,Fry, I love ice fishing.
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth," I shouldn't be out in this cold. I 'ave no protective fat, hair, or warm blood. I'm not even legally a mammal."
Cold Warriors,Fry," Pfff! [Fry points at Professor Farnsworth with his right hand.] You dunno what cold is. [Fry turns away from Professor Farnsworth. Amy, Fry, Hermes, Zoidberg, Professor Farnsworth, and Leela resume walking.] I was frozen for a thousand years."
Cold Warriors,Bender, You were?! Uh. [Bender resumes walking.] Learn somethin' dumb every day.
Cold Warriors,Paper-hatted salesman, Live bait!
Cold Warriors,Paper-hatted salesman," Get your live bait here. [The paper-hatted salesman turns to his right. The box is opened by three tentacles. The three tentacles grab the paper-hatted salesman and pull him inside the box, but leave his hat outside.] Whoa! [The box is closed. The paper-hatted salesman's hat falls on the box. The box is opened again.] [off camera] Fresh-killed bait!"
Cold Warriors,Amy," Can we get inside the shack? [Amy removes her hands from her waist, revealing her belly button to be showing.] I'm wearing a belly parka!"
Cold Warriors,Leela," If I understand ice fishing, and I'm pretty sure I don't, we'll need to laser-blast a hole in the ice."
Cold Warriors,Fry," No. No crazy technology. [Fry grabs a cutting tool with his left hand.] Here. Bender, use your immense Robot strength to drill a hole the old-fashioned way."
Cold Warriors,Bender, I don't see any irony in that.
Cold Warriors,Fry, And... Woilà [sic]!
Cold Warriors,Fry, Everybody's ice-fishing! [Fry looks around.] How come nobody's ice-fishing?
Cold Warriors,Bender, Hot-cocoa break.
Cold Warriors,Fry," Cocoa is for yodelling babies. [Fry grabs a can labelled LÖBRAU BEER with his left hand.] If you're sober, it isn't ice fishing."
Cold Warriors,Fry," Mom, what's my temperature?"
Cold Warriors,Mrs. Fry, Fifty. Forty-five. [Fry looks around.] Forty. It's all over! [Fry shrieks. Mrs. Fry is watching football on television.] Woo! [Mrs. Fry raises her arms and then puts them back down.] Down at the 35!
Cold Warriors,Fry, I'm really sick.
Cold Warriors,Mrs. Fry," Huh? [Mrs. Fry turns to Fry.] Oh, sorry. [Mrs. Fry looks at the thermometer.] [bored] Hundred-an'-nine. [happy] We'll check again at half-time."
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr," You home from school, you traitor?"
Cold Warriors,Fry, I fell through the ice! [Fry sits up.] Cut me some slack!
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr, Nobody cut me any slack when I broke my spine. [Yancy Fry Sr points at his spine with his right thumb twice.] Didn't even take a day off o' work. [Yancy Fry Sr crosses his arms again.] Lotta people depend on you when you sell trampolines door to door.
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Jr," Here's your homework, ya lucky knob."
Cold Warriors,Fry," And, with a little more luck from my seven-leaf clover, I might get sick enough to miss the whole semester."
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Jr," Hey, give me that!"
Cold Warriors,Fry, Ooh.
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Jr, Come on.
Cold Warriors,Fry, No.
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Jr," Give it to me, ya faker!"
Cold Warriors,Fry," No. You're not gettin'— [Yancy Fry Jr jumps at Fry, making him and a guinea pig in a cage on the bedside table fall on the floor. Yancy Fry Jr pushes against Fry's chin.] Ow! My underbite!"
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr," [off camera] Come on, Yancy! [on camera] Your brother's sick! [Yancy Fry Sr points at Fry with his right hand.] You'll never have a better chance to take 'im out."
Cold Warriors,Fry, Dad! [Yancy Fry Jr grunts as he pushes Fry's face against the floor. There is a flyer reading NERD SEARCH '88 SCIENCE COMPETITION.] Nerd Search '88? [Fry turns to his left.] What's this?
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Jr, Some stupid science contest for smart wads. [Yancy Fry Jr crosses his arms.] NASA's gonna pick one kid's experiment to launch into space.
Cold Warriors,Fry, I can make a space experiment. [Fry turns to his left.] I just got a new thing o' glitter!
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr," I'm not sure science is your thing, seein' how that chimp at the zoo tricked you outta your allowance."
Cold Warriors,Fry," [angry] Yeah, well, I'll show you. [Fry points at Yancy Fry Sr with his left hand.] [sad] And Mr. Bananas. [back to normal] Anyway, I've got nothin' better to do while I'm sick in bed. Wait. That's it! I'll make a space experiment about the common cold! [Fry looks around.] Where's that contest flyer?"
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr," You're holdin' it, genius."
Cold Warriors,Fry," Oh, good."
Cold Warriors,Fry, [sad] I feel awful. [happy] But it was worth it to catch an' kill this baby fish.
Cold Warriors,Amy, Shmeez! [Fry turns to Amy.] What's with the shmiffling?
Cold Warriors,Fry, It's nothing. [Fry scratches his nose with his right hand and sniffs.] Just a common cold.
Cold Warriors,Zoidberg, Wha?
Cold Warriors,Bender, It's a common uh?
Cold Warriors,Hermes, Wha?
Cold Warriors,Leela, What the hell's a common cold?
Cold Warriors,Bender," Is it valuable? Could it be taken from you if you were, say... [Bender lifts up a tube with his right hand and hits his left hand with it.] Unconscious?"
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth," A common— [Professor Farnsworth walks up to the conference table and puts his hands on it.] A common cold?! No! [Professor Farnsworth looks up.] [extendedly] No! [Professor Farnsworth looks forward.] [back to normal] Ever since Fry first came to us, I've lived in mortal terror that this would happen!"
Cold Warriors,Leela, I never heard you mention that.
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth," [calm] Oh, I try to act cool, but inside I'm [stressed] freaking out!"
Cold Warriors,Fry, It's just a cold! [Fry sneezes aggressively.] What's the big deal?
Cold Warriors,Smitty, This is the police. [The camera begins zooming in on URL and Smitty.] An unknown pathogen 'as been detected on these premises. [The camera stops zooming in on URL and Smitty.] Come out with your hands— [Smitty looks confused.] I mean... Stay in with your hands up!
Cold Warriors,URL, You are hereby quarantined until such time as it is deemed safe to enter and shoot your asses.
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth," Eh, now, now. [Professor Farnsworth turns to the others.] Let's not all panic at once. We'll have to take shifts. [Professor Farnsworth turns to Hermes.] Hermes, you'll take the first six hours."
Cold Warriors,Hermes, Very well.
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth, [off camera] Louder! [The camera zooms in on Hermes' face. Hermes screams louder.] [screaming] Louder! [The camera zooms in on Hermes' face. Hermes screams louder.] [back to normal] Crybaby.
Cold Warriors,Fry," Look  I just 'ave a common [screaming] cold! [Fry turns to the male CDC scientist and then to the conference table.] It'll be gone as fast as I can sneeze, hurl, and squirt it out."
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth," No, it won't! [Amy, Bender, Zoidberg, Leela, Professor Farnsworth, and Hermes hide on the side of the table that is opposite to Fry.] The common cold died out five-hundred years ago. And, subsequently, Humanity lost all resistance to its ravages. But the virus survived in you... [Professor Farnsworth points at Fry with his left hand.] [off camera] Frozen for a thousand years."
Cold Warriors,Fry, Huh. [Fry turns to his right.] So it was hiding deep down inside o' me? Like my skeleton bones?
Cold Warriors,Leela," Give it to us straight, Professor. How incredibly deadly is it?"
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth, [worried] We don't know. [Professor Farnsworth shrugs.] It could kill millions or nobody. I suppose it might even bring a few people back to life! [happy] Anything is possible in science.
Cold Warriors,Amy," Oh, no! [Amy turns to her left.] I've got it too! [Bender, Zoidberg, Leela, Professor Farnsworth, and Hermes hide on the side of the table that is opposite to Fry and Amy.] My nose is all gunked up with blork!"
Cold Warriors,Hermes, And I've got a hankerin' for a useless remedy created by a schoolteacher.
Cold Warriors,Zoidberg, Uh-oh. I think I'm getting swollen glands.
Cold Warriors,Amy, [extendedly] Ew!
Cold Warriors,Hermes, [extendedly] Oh!
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth," [extendedly, off camera] Oh!"
Cold Warriors,Leela, Screw the quarantine! I'm outta here!
Cold Warriors,Female CDC scientist, Initiate containment procedure.
Cold Warriors,Leela, Ah! [The male CDC scientist hits Leela again.] Ow! [The male CDC scientist hits Leela again.] Oh!
Cold Warriors,Male CDC scientist, G'wan now.
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth," Now I'm sick! [Leela stops walking backwards. Professor Farnsworth turns to Fry.] I shudder to think what this cold will do to me. Yesterday, I was nearly killed by a tight hat!"
Cold Warriors,Bender, I'd be remiss if I didn't rub your goopy noses in the fact that I'm immune.
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth, Which is why we'll all be counting on you and you alone to nurse us through this catastrophe.
Cold Warriors,Bender," Why, God? [Bender raises both his hands.] Why 'ave I been singled out?"
Cold Warriors,Fry, Everyone just calm down and make yourself a tissue walrus.
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr," [off camera] Damn it, son. [Mrs. Fry and Yancy Fry Sr are sitting at the table as well.] [on camera] Lose the tissues. You're ruinin' Thanksgivin' dinner."
Cold Warriors,Fry, I'm busy with my space experiment. I can't devote precious brainpower to blowing my nose.
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr," You're never gonna win that science fair, Philip. Face it  [Yancy Fry Sr points at Fry with his left hand.] Someone with your limited brainpower'd be lucky to get a job as a pizza delivery boy."
Cold Warriors,Mr. Panucci," Hey, Barack! [Mr. Panucci puts the pizza box on the counter.] Pizza goin' out. [Mr. Panucci raises his hands.] Come on!"
Cold Warriors,Barack Obama," Man, I've got to go back to law school."
Cold Warriors,Fry, Pfff! [Fry turns to Yancy Fry Jr. Barack Obama leaves.] I'm not gonna wind up a loser like that guy.
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Jr," Sure you will. [Fry turns to Yancy Fry Jr.] You're gonna lose the science fair. [Yancy Fry Jr points forward with his right hand. Fry turns to his right.] And that's who's gonna beat ya. [A boy wearing glasses, a shirt, and trousers and holding a soda cup with his right hand is in front of the counter. Mr. Panucci walks in front of him.] [off camera] Josh Gedgie, boy scientist."
Cold Warriors,Josh Gedgie," Pi over four radians of pizza, please."
Cold Warriors,Mr. Panucci, What is that? About a slice?
Cold Warriors,Josh Gedgie, More like exactly a slice.
Cold Warriors,Fry," Game on, Gedgie."
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Jr, [off camera] Ew!
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr," I've 'ad worse. When I was shot down over Korea, I had to eat Kimchi. [slowly] He was our interpreter."
Cold Warriors,Bender, [screaming] Coming!
Cold Warriors,Bender, What now?
Cold Warriors,Amy, Humidifier.
Cold Warriors,Bender, Fine. [Bender's chest cabinet starts shaking and begins exuding steam. A red light appears. Leela grabs the bell with her right hand and rings it. Bender turns to his left and stops exuding steam. The red light disappears.] Yes?!
Cold Warriors,Leela, Where's that chicken soup we asked for?
Cold Warriors,Bender," Chicken. [Bender throws the chicken, puts his left hand in his chest cabinet, and pulls out a bottle.] Water. [Bender throws the bottle, puts his left hand in his chest cabinet, and pulls out a lighter.] Fire. [Bender throws the lighter. The chicken and the bottle are in front of Leela. The lighter falls on Leela's forehead.] [off camera] You take it from there."
Cold Warriors,Hermes," This is torture. The fever. The chills. And the sweating! [Hermes turns to Amy's feet, points at them with both his hands, and pushes them against Zoidberg's face.] Amy's horrible sweating!"
Cold Warriors,Bender, [slowly] That's it. I'm leavin' while I still 'ave my dignity. [Bender removes the green substance from his face.] [back to normal] See you in the obituaries!
Cold Warriors,Male CDC scientist, How's the... Uh... Containment holdin' up?
Cold Warriors,Female CDC scientist," Without turning my head, I'd say one-hundred percent."
Cold Warriors,Bender," Howdy, folks. And may I say, ""Nice work keepin' those sickos penned up."" Put 'er there. [Bender shakes one of the officers' hand with his right hand.] You too, buddy. [Bender shakes another of the officers' hand with his right hand.] An' you. [Bender shakes another of the officers' hand with his right hand.] An' you. [Bender shakes another of the officers' hand with his right hand.] An' you. [Bender shakes another of the officers' hand with his right hand.] An' especially you."
Cold Warriors,Fifth CDC officer, That Robot was a heckuva nice feller.
Cold Warriors,Fry, You'd better stay here during biology. [Fry puts the cage in an open locker.] Mrs. Jenkins dissects anything smaller than a fifth grader.
Cold Warriors,Josh Gedgie," Well, if it isn't Grandmaster Phlegm. I heard you're enterin' the NASA science competition."
Cold Warriors,Fry, Maybe I am... LL Fool J!
Cold Warriors,Josh Gedgie, So what's your project? The effects of losing on idiots?
Cold Warriors,Fry, [angry] No! [happy] I'm gonna infect my guinea pig with the common cold and launch it into space to see if it gets cured by cosmic rays!
Cold Warriors,Josh Gedgie, Lame! Though the common-cold virus does seem like a judge pleaser. [Josh Gedgie strokes his chin and looks around.] I think I'll steal that an' do an experiment that's slightly less... Very stupid!
Cold Warriors,Fry," But that's my idea! You are an evil, evil nerd!"
Cold Warriors,Josh Gedgie, Gedgie out!
Cold Warriors,Fry, We'll show him who's stupid.
Cold Warriors,Morbo, Linda?
Cold Warriors,Linda," Morbo. The so-called common cold, introduced by living fossil Philip J. Fry, is spreading out of control. [Morbo grabs a tissue with his left hand, blows his nose in it, and cleans his nose with it.] All citizens are advised to wash their hands thoroughly after beating up Philip J. Fry."
Cold Warriors,Fry, Phew! [Fry turns to the others.] Lucky I'm safely locked up here with you guys.
Cold Warriors,Amy, There 'e is!
Cold Warriors,Hermes, Get him!
Cold Warriors,Fry, Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! What are you—
Cold Warriors,Morbo, [on television] The situation is expected to deteriorate as newscasters whip the city into a panic.
Cold Warriors,Morbo, Run! Run for your lives!
Cold Warriors,Linda," And, finally, the heart-warming story of a handicapped magician who didn't know when to give up."
Cold Warriors,Zapp," I don't like the looks of this, Mr. President. [Zapp turns to Richard Nixon's head.] Shall I switch it off?"
Cold Warriors,Richard Nixon's head," Negative. [Richard Nixon's head presses a button on his desk with his Robotic right hand. We hear a beep.] Rose Mary, release the Surgeon General!"
Cold Warriors,Woman, [off camera] Get in there!
Cold Warriors,Wernstrom, Ow! [Wernstrom closes his eyes and puts both his hands in front of his face.] It's bright out here.
Cold Warriors,Richard Nixon's head, Wernstrom... [Wernstrom opens his eyes and puts both his hands down.] The quarantine 'as failed. Give me a worst-case scenario. And make it grim.
Cold Warriors,Wernstrom," I've prepared some projections. [The red dot on Manhattan has disappeared. Wernstrom lifts up a remote control with two buttons on it with his right hand and presses one of the buttons. Zapp, Wernstrom, and Richard Nixon's head are looking at the screen. Wernstrom presses the button again. Another red dot appears on Manhattan.] Should the virus escape Manhattan, this is how far it will spread in twelve hours. [Wernstrom turns to his right and presses the button again. More red appears on the map. Wernstrom turns to his left and presses the button again. More red appears on the map.] This is twenty-four hours. [Wernstrom presses the button again. More red appears on the map.] This is a Verizon coverage map. [Wernstrom presses the button again. A rotating red globe appears on the screen.] And, in thirty-six hours, it will have infected the entire planet!"
Cold Warriors,Richard Nixon's head, Options?
Cold Warriors,Zapp, We 'ave only one option. [Wernstrom turns to Zapp.] Protocol sixty-two.
Cold Warriors,Richard Nixon's head, Not possible. We don't 'ave nearly enough piranhas!
Cold Warriors,Zapp, Then protocol sixty-three it is.
Cold Warriors,Hermes," Hooray! [Hermes puts his arms down, coughs, and raises his arms again.] They're letting us out!"
Cold Warriors,Zoidberg, And hundreds of black hovercopters are coming to welcome us!
Cold Warriors,Hermes," They shrink-wrapped the hole city! Well, it could be worse. [Hermes shrugs. We see laser rays.] It is worse!"
Cold Warriors,Zoidberg, They're flying Manhattan into the Sun! [Zoidberg turns to Fry and points at the Sun with his left claw.] They must've been outta piranhas.
Cold Warriors,Hermes, They're gonna kill the virus by exposing it to the heat of our burning bodies!
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth, I'm just glad I have my wool scarf.
Cold Warriors,Fry, What good is a wool—
Cold Warriors,Bender, Guys! Guys! You're never gonna believe this!
Cold Warriors,Amy, We know! They shmooped up Manhattan and blasted us toward the Sun!
Cold Warriors,Bender," They did? Aw! [Bender opens his chest cabinet with his right hand, pulls out a box with SAVE OUR CHILDREN'S MUSEUM! on it and eleven coins in it with his left hand, and shakes the box.] So that's why this was unguarded."
Cold Warriors,Wernstrom," People of New New York, this is Surgeon General Ogden Vernstrom."
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth, Wern-[violent coughing and sneezing]-strom!
Cold Warriors,Wernstrom," No doctor likes hurling his patients into the Sun, but, since there is no way to make a vaccine for the common cold—"
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth, There is a way to make a vaccine!
Cold Warriors,Fry, There is? [Fry raises his arms.] [extendedly] Yay!
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth," Of course, there's a catch."
Cold Warriors,Fry, [extendedly] Woo!
Cold Warriors,Fry, [continued] Woo! [extendedly] Yay! Yay! [Fry turns to Professor Farnsworth.] So what's the catch?
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth," The vaccine requires the original, unmutated, 20th-century cold virus. So I need to grind you into a paste."
Cold Warriors,Leela," Professor, no!"
Cold Warriors,Fry," It's okay, Leela. This is all my fault, sort of. If this will save you, then, please, turn me into a virus milkshake."
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth, He consented! [Professor Farnsworth grabs the lever.] You all heard it!
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr," Yes, sir. Many of these entries merit a ride in the mighty bosom of our space shuttle. [Yancy Fry Sr crosses his arms.] And then there's your so-called entry."
Cold Warriors,Fry," Jeez! [Josh Gedgie opens his eyes.] Walk much, Gedgie?!"
Cold Warriors,Josh Gedgie, Absurd. You really think your guinea pig could survive in the vacuum of space?
Cold Warriors,Fry," He already survived in the vacuum of my mom. [Fry shrugs.] I mean, ""My mom's vacuum."""
Cold Warriors,Josh Gedgie," My experiment measures the effects of microgravity of the propagation of the common cold virus in an anaerobic environment; i.e., space. [Josh Gedgie puts the suitcase on a table and opens it; revealing a sign, seven test tubes, three petri dishes, and more objects; and puts the sign on the table. The sign reads, JOSH GEDGIE - The effects of microgravity on the propagation of the common cold virus in an anaerobic environment. Josh Gedgie turns to his right and crosses his arms.] Impressed?"
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr," Damn right I am. [Yancy Fry Sr walks up to Josh Gedgie.] That's some dry, emotionless science. [Yancy Fry Sr pats Josh Gedgie on Josh Gedgie's left arm three times.] Nice job, son."
Cold Warriors,Fry," Hey, wait a second! [Fry looks at Professor Farnsworth.] I know where you can get some 20th-century cold virus without killing me!"
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth," Hush, lad. [Professor Farnsworth raises his right hand.] I'm totally in the zone."
Cold Warriors,Fry, We just 'ave to find the Nerd Search '88 satellite!
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth, [sad] I don't know why I even build these things.
Cold Warriors,Leela," Gunnery Chief Bender, blast us out of quarantine."
Cold Warriors,Bender," Aye, aye, lady."
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth," Oh, fiddlepoop! Our weapons aren't strong enough to puncture a thin plastic tent that thick?!"
Cold Warriors,Leela, No. But theirs are!
Cold Warriors,Kif," Captain, a ship is attempting to break the quarantine."
Cold Warriors,Zapp, Blow them to baco bits with a well placed warning shot!
Cold Warriors,Kif, But—
Cold Warriors,Zapp, Oops.
Cold Warriors,Fry, We'll find that cold virus. [Fry raises his left fist.] The Nerd Search satellite was launched on the space shuttle and released into orbit.
Cold Warriors,Leela, Hmmm. All ancient satellites were swept up as space junk in 2113. [Leela looks at Fry and removes her right hand from the device as she turns to him.] I actually knew that offhand. [Leela puts her right hand back on the device as she turns to it.] I'm Facebooking right now.
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth," Aha! [Professor Farnsworth turns his chair towards Leela and Fry.] That satellite was scuttled on Enceladus, Saturn's main dump moon!"
Cold Warriors,Fry, Let's dump it up!
Cold Warriors,Leela, This is the exact location of the dump. [Leela turns to her left.] But there's nothing here.
Cold Warriors,Bender, Can we please go home an' die now?
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth, I'm with Bender. [Fry turns to Professor Farnsworth.] Whatever was here's been covered by centuries of ice buildup.
Cold Warriors,Fry," No! [Fry walks forward.] It's under here somewhere. We just 'ave to bust our way down. [Fry raises both his fists.] Remember the code of the ice. Thin an' crispy, way too risky."
Cold Warriors,Leela," [screaming, off camera] I found a satellite!"
Cold Warriors,Fry, Let's just hope the experiment's still in here. [Fry opens the frozen satellite with his left hand.] Yes! We're saved!
Cold Warriors,Man," And now, to present the awards, our very special guest. [The man straightens his tie.] He walked on the Moon and now he is judging a high-school science contest. [The man points up with his left hand.] Truly a man who can and will do anything... Dr. Buzz Aldrin!"
Cold Warriors,Buzz Aldrin," Wow! [The audience stops applauding as well. Buzz Aldrin points at the man with his right hand.] I could've used an introduction like that when I first met the Moon men! [Buzz Aldrin laughs. The audience does the same.] But, seriously, there are Moon men. [The man approaches the podium and points at the watch on his left arm with his right hand and clears his throat. Buzz Aldrin turns to the man and then to the crowd.] Okay. This year's Nerd Search runner-up is a young man who devised a way to add and subtract in zero gravity. [Buzz Aldrin raises his left hand.] Vijay Patel and his calculator space hat!"
Cold Warriors,Vijai Patel," [extendedly] Woo! [Vijai Patel walks up to the stage, shakes Buzz Aldrin's hand, grabs a piece of rolled paper, and turns to the crowd.] Woo!"
Cold Warriors,Buzz Aldrin, And now the grand-prize winner whose experiment will be launched into space.
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr," [off camera] Look at that cocky smirk. [The camera zooms out, revealing Yancy Fry Sr. Yancy Fry Sr turns to Fry and puts his left hand on Fry's right shoulder. Fry turns to Yancy Fry Sr. Yancy Fry Sr turns forward. Josh Gedgie turns forward. Yancy Fry Sr removes his left hand from Fry's right shoulder.] [on camera] My money's on Gedgie."
Cold Warriors,Fry," Yeah? He may 'ave brains, but I 'ave heart."
Cold Warriors,Buzz Aldrin, Josh Gedgie!
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr, I'll bring the car around.
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth, What a well prepared virus culture. [Professor Farnsworth lifts up the petri dish.] This will make a fine vaccine.
Cold Warriors,Fry," Good thing Gedgie won. My dumb experiment wouldn't've lasted an hour in space, let alone a thousand years. Besides, Buzz Aldrin ran over my guinea pig in the parking lot."
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth," Eh, okay. Uh, come on, gang. Let's go inoculate everyone and cram Manhattan back into its rightful hole!"
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth, This may hurt a little.
Cold Warriors,Wernstrom, Ow!
Cold Warriors,Farnsworth," Now, I'll give you the shot."
Cold Warriors,Leela," You saved millions of lives, Fry. You should feel proud. No matter what your dad said to you."
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr," You still 'aven't thanked me for pullin' you outta the lake, soldier."
Cold Warriors,Fry, I could've flip-flopped out.
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr," I know that. [Yancy Fry Sr grabs a can labelled LÖBRAU BEER with his right hand and opens it.] Look, son. [Fry is looking forward.] I know I give you the business sometimes. [Fry looks at Yancy Fry Sr.] But, if I'm hard on you, it's only 'cause I want you to grow up strong and resilient. [Yancy Fry Sr looks at Fry and then up.] Someday, you may face adversities so preposterous, I can't even conceive of them. [Yancy Fry Sr shrugs and looks at Fry.] But I know you'll pull through and make me proud. [Yancy Fry Sr puts his left hand on Fry's left shoulder.] I love you, son."
Cold Warriors,Yancy Fry Sr," [off camera] Now, bundle up. [The camera finishes zooming out.] I don't want you gettin' frozen."
Cold Warriors,,
Overclockwise,,
Overclockwise,Fry, Bucket of hot dogs?
Overclockwise,Cubert, Check.
Overclockwise,Fry, Butt massager engaged?
Overclockwise,Bender, Check.
Overclockwise,Fry, Then let the video games begin! Wait. Hang on. I— I lost my controller.
Overclockwise,Cubert, There is no controller. The X-Cube tracks your motions with a built-in camera.
Overclockwise,Bender," Oh, yeah? Track this motion."
Overclockwise,Cubert, Frykowski. BenderIsGreat34. Follow me!
Overclockwise,Bender, Sounds like fun on the bun.
Overclockwise,Cubert, Aw! You guys again?!
Overclockwise,German #1, Ach! These dorkeschoens. Let's humiliate them with slingshots.
Overclockwise,Fry," Shoot your weapon, Private!"
Overclockwise,Bender, Wait. How do I— Hold on. Oops.
Overclockwise,German #1," Sorry to kill und run, but I really must be Göring."
Overclockwise,Fry, Man!
Overclockwise,Bender, Pwned again.
Overclockwise,Cubert, This is all Bender's fault. Admit it! Your reflexes suck!
Overclockwise,Bender," Aw... It's true! My circuitry's twelve years outta-date. I can't keep up with today's high-speed, top-o'-the-line kids."
Overclockwise,Fry, You can't even keep up with me and I'm some sort o' stone-age throwback.
Overclockwise,Cubert, You know... I might be able to speed up your reflexes by overclockin' ya.
Overclockwise,Bender," Eh... What's that, sonny? You say it'll put some whoopiee in my cushion?"
Overclockwise,Cubert," This may take a while. I've got to adjust the memory timing, raise the CPU voltage, and delete twelve terabytes of outdated catchphrases."
Overclockwise,Bender, Sounds like fun on the bun!
Overclockwise,Female voice, Deleted.
Overclockwise,Bender, [sad] Oh.
Overclockwise,Leela," Fry, can we talk about our relationship?"
Overclockwise,Fry," Of course. Our relationship is the best thing in my life, so I'm sure I'll enjoy talking about it with you."
Overclockwise,Leela," I dunno. I guess I'm just feeling uneasy about us being so on-again, off-again."
Overclockwise,Fry," Maybe it's none o' my business, but, if it were up to me, we'd be on all the time. An' I mean all the time."
Overclockwise,Leela," But what would that be like? I mean... If we were together, where would we be ten years from now? Still here?"
Overclockwise,Fry, Definitely. Or... Somewhere else.
Overclockwise,Leela," Maybe I'm havin' some kinda... Early-life crisis, but... Look  Don't you ever wonder about the future?"
Overclockwise,Fry," Well, sure, but... You're always in it. Also, sometimes, terminators."
Overclockwise,Cubert, Alright. You should run a lot faster now. Unless you die.
Overclockwise,Bender, [back to normal] Woo! I'm smart! I know how to spell aardvark. February is the shortest month. There's three-thousand-eighteen jelly beans in that jar.
Overclockwise,Cubert," Damn, I'm good."
Overclockwise,Bender, I mean three-thousand-eighteen rat kidneys.
Overclockwise,Cubert," Now, then, my man. Let's see if your reflexes are—"
Overclockwise,Bender, Faster!
Overclockwise,Cubert, [quickly] Get 'em! Get 'em! Get 'em!
Overclockwise,Bender," Eh, foreign aggressors. Vhat's up?"
Overclockwise,German #1," Oh, we were just eating spaetzle and listening to Kraftwerk— I— I mean, ""Fire!"""
Overclockwise,German #2," That tap-dancing, decadent jazz baby is too fast for us!"
Overclockwise,German #1, Let's see him outrun a V-2!
Overclockwise,Bender, It's my brains against your von Braun!
Overclockwise,German #1, Ach! I could have fired a V-8!
Overclockwise,Walt, Those guys normally stink. That's why we play them exclusively.
Overclockwise,Larry, Those cheaters must've cheated!
Overclockwise,Walt," Now, Larry. Let's deal with this like mature adults. [screaming, extendedly] Mommy!"
Overclockwise,Mom," What is it, you colicky bastards?!"
Overclockwise,Walt, We were playing video games and the other kids didn't play fair!
Overclockwise,Mom, What?! Nobody rips off my kids but me! We can find out who they are through their motion-capture camera. It better not be those little Korean girls again. Aha! Got it!
Overclockwise,Bender, [on the screen] Woo! We're the greatest! Mostly me!
Overclockwise,Mom, [off camera] Bender Rodríguez?
Overclockwise,Walt, [off camera] But he's a stock MomCorp bending unit. [on camera] And 'e's twelve years out-of-date. How could 'e possibly play that well?
Overclockwise,Bender, [on the screen] Did you see me?! History came alive an' I killed it!
Overclockwise,Cubert," [on the screen] If I overclock you some more, maybe we can beat those Korean girls!"
Overclockwise,Mom," Well, well. That nerd burglar overclocked the Robot's processor!"
Overclockwise,Larry, And that voids his warranty. Even an idiot like me knows that.
Overclockwise,Mom, An idiot like you knows nothing! What matters is... It violates the licence agreement. And that means I've got 'im right by his little—
Overclockwise,Smitty," Ding dong. I'm sayin' ""Ding dong"" 'cause you don't 'ave a doorbell."
Overclockwise,Cubert," Hey, pigs."
Overclockwise,URL, We're lookin' for a Cubert J. Farnsworth.
Overclockwise,Cubert, You're porkin' at 'im!
Overclockwise,Smitty, You're under arrest for felony violation of the MomCorp licence agreement.
Overclockwise,Farnsworth, What's all this oinking about?! Who called the fuzz?!
Overclockwise,URL," Sir, who's this boy's legal guardian?"
Overclockwise,Farnsworth, You're porkin' at 'im!
Overclockwise,URL, Then the charges apply to you too.
Overclockwise,Farnsworth, Wha?
Overclockwise,Mom, Farnsworth?! What a lucky break!
Overclockwise,Mom," After all these years, I've got 'im! And legally too!"
Overclockwise,Larry, Even an idiot like me knows he'll be ruined.
Overclockwise,Mom, An idiot like you is correct!
Overclockwise,Farnsworth, You overclocked Bender?! What did I teach you about tinkering with machinery?
Overclockwise,Cubert, How. You taught me how.
Overclockwise,Farnsworth," I also taught you not to get caught! Oh, I wish I'd never cloned you."
Overclockwise,Cubert, It's not my fault! I didn't even know Bender had a licence agreement!
Overclockwise,Farnsworth, Neither did I— Ooh.
Overclockwise,Farnsworth," Bender, as my newest employee, could you bend this drinking straw for me?"
Overclockwise,Bender, Sure. Let me just.
Overclockwise,Mom," [on the hologram] First, click the licence agreement, deary."
Overclockwise,Farnsworth," I really shouldn't agree to things I don't understand, but I'm slightly thirsty."
Overclockwise,Farnsworth," Oh, God! I clicked without reading!"
Overclockwise,Cubert, An' I slightly modified a thing that I own!
Overclockwise,Farnsworth, We're monsters!
Overclockwise,Walt," Congratulations, Mother. Can you die happy now?"
Overclockwise,Mom, Not yet!
Overclockwise,Walt, Darn!
Overclockwise,Mom, I can't rest until this bending unit is restored to factory specs.
Overclockwise,Igner, Why not?
Overclockwise,Mom," If people learn they can overclock their old Robots, they won't buy my new Robots! This will not stand! [off camera] Hoverfish, [on camera] bring me the clock of Bender Rodríguez."
Overclockwise,Hermes," Good news, everyone! That's what the Professor would say if we weren't in jail facin' a life sentence."
Overclockwise,Bender," Guys! Guys! I discovered I have an extra processor in my compartment o' mystery. Bein' overclocked was a start, but, once I activate this processor, I'll be all like, ""You're a big dummy, Einstein! Get a haircut!"" Aw! Wow! I can't believe how stupid I used to be an' you still are. What are all these page-y things?"
Overclockwise,Amy, Look out! You're overheating!
Overclockwise,Bender," Yeah, yeah. There. Now, I'm water-cooled. I can stimulate my intellect without further thermodynamical disruptions."
Overclockwise,Fry," I miss the old, illiterate Bender."
Overclockwise,Hermes," What's happened to you, mon? I thought you liked beer an' knock-knock jokes."
Overclockwise,Bender," I'm processin' so fast, it's like I can anticipate that the ceilin' fan's gonna fall an' knock Zoidberg unconscious."
Overclockwise,Zoidberg," Wrong, Mr. Genius."
Overclockwise,Bender," Not that ceilin' fan. In fact, lookin' ahead, it's obvious Mom won't allow me to stay accelerated like this. Hmmm. Who's up for a turkey dinner an' a game o' badminton?"
Overclockwise,Hermes, Say what?!
Overclockwise,Bender, Yup.
Overclockwise,Amy, Uh-oh. 'E must be overheating again.
Overclockwise,Hoverfish," Bending unit, you are ordered to report for factory reset."
Overclockwise,Bender," Okay. Sure. But, first, this."
Overclockwise,Zoidberg," I hear turkey. Woop-woop-woop-woop-woop— Oh, boy. Ay... Ay. Ay."
Overclockwise,Bender," Ten more processors for me. Once I install these, I'll have access to the loftiest realms o' thought!"
Overclockwise,Zoidberg, Anyone have access to a lofty realm of gravy?
Overclockwise,Bender, I can conceive of gravies that would boggle your tiny mind! But it's not safe here. So I'll need to find a hideout.
Overclockwise,Fry," Hideout? Bender, are you becoming some kinda supervillain?"
Overclockwise,Bender," Farewell, monobrains."
Overclockwise,Yellow and red lawyer," Your Honour, Mom is a poor, frail industrialist with three special sons who require constant neglect. Yet, isn't it true, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that this boy, this... Cubert Farnsworth..."
Overclockwise,Cubert, [frightened] That's my name. Don't wear it out.
Overclockwise,Yellow and red lawyer, Deliberately robber her blind by improving his own Robot?!
Overclockwise,Fishy Joe, It's true! 'E did it!
Overclockwise,Yellow and red lawyer, No further questions for this jury.
Overclockwise,Ron Whitey," Before I call a recess for mimosas and horse breeding, can the defence produce the bending unit in question?"
Overclockwise,Farnsworth, [whispering] We don't know where the hell 'e is.
Overclockwise,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour, that is something we cannot a-doodle-do."
Overclockwise,Ron Whitey, Then I'm holding the defendants in contempt and fining them ten-thousand dollars a day until they produce the Robot.
Overclockwise,Hermes," Oh! At that rate, Planet Express will be bankrupt in... Four fingers!"
Overclockwise,Hermes," It's been a good run, people, but this is the end."
Overclockwise,Zoidberg," [off camera] Wait! [on camera] I've got it! This building's technically in the theatre district. If we could mount one big musical featuring everyone's talents, we might just save Planet Express!"
Overclockwise,Nibbler, We'll call it Nibbler on the Roof!
Overclockwise,Fry, Alright!
Overclockwise,Zoidberg, Hooray!
Overclockwise,Hermes, We're saved!
Overclockwise,Leela, I've been thinking a lot about moving on with my life. And hearing the words Nibbler on the Roof has given me the kick in the pants I needed. It's time for me to leave and make a fresh start.
Overclockwise,Fry," [sad] Don't go, Leela, please. You an' me... We were supposed to..."
Overclockwise,Leela, What?
Overclockwise,Fry, I dunno. [happy] But someday we'll find out. [sad] Won't we?
Overclockwise,Leela," Goodbye, Fry."
Overclockwise,Fry," I dunno, Randy. I just feel like my life's falling apart. The Professor's in jail and now Leela's gone forever."
Overclockwise,Randy Munchnik," Stay strong, Fry."
Overclockwise,Fry, You're the best friend I have left. [sad] An' I barely even know you.
Overclockwise,Randy Munchnik, Have you thought about asking Bender for help?
Overclockwise,Fry," [angry] What are you, Randy? A complete moron?! [sad] I'd love to talk to Bender, but I 'ave no idea where 'e is."
Overclockwise,Randy Munchnik," Well, if 'e's runnin' on twelve processors, 'e must be some place with a lotta power and liquid coolant."
Overclockwise,Fry, [angry] Aw! You're no help at all! [sad] I'm gonna go kill myself.
Overclockwise,Fry, [off camera] Wait a second. Power. Liquid coolant. [on camera] That gives me the option of electrocution or drowning.
Overclockwise,Paper-hatted salesman, [off camera] Barrels here. [on camera] Can't go over the Falls without a barrel.
Overclockwise,Fry, What are my chances of surviving in one o' those?
Overclockwise,Paper-hatted salesman, Slim to none.
Overclockwise,Fry, I like those odds!
Overclockwise,Fry," [inside the barrel] Wait. This isn't a barrel. It's just a stinking cask! I want my money [screaming, extendedly] back! [back to normal] Ow! Ow!"
Overclockwise,Fry, That was not worth three-thousand dollars.
Overclockwise,Fry, Hello? Anybody?
Overclockwise,Bender, [off camera] Fry?
Overclockwise,Fry, Bender?! Are you in here?!
Overclockwise,Bender, In here is the only place I'm not. I amuse myself.
Overclockwise,Fry, But— Bender?! What happened to you?
Overclockwise,Bender, I'll try to put it in terms you can comprehend. I passed the existential singularity.
Overclockwise,Fry, Try harder!
Overclockwise,Bender, I hacked myself inside-out and now the entire universe is my processor.
Overclockwise,Fry," Whoa! I definitely wanna hear about that. But, first, I need your help. The Professor and Cubert are in trouble and Leela left me. I'm in misery!"
Overclockwise,Bender," I've grown far beyond the petty concerns of your world. Every time I burp, a new galaxy is born. [Bender burps and two galaxies appear.] Two if I've been eatin' broccoli. All existence is just a chess game. An' I can see fifty moves ahead. Human emotion no longer concerns me."
Overclockwise,Fry, But— But Randy said—
Overclockwise,Bender, [screaming] Randy?! [back to normal] 'Ave you been hangin' out with Randy?!
Overclockwise,Fry," Please, Bender. If everything is a chess game for you, you must know how to help me."
Overclockwise,Bender," I'm sorry, Fry. But some games you just can't win. [off camera] Cubert and the Professor are guilty. The jury will vote to convict. [sad] I can't change that."
Overclockwise,Fry," Well, what about Leela? Is there any hope things could still work out between us?"
Overclockwise,Bender," [on camera] It's getting late. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some new heavy elements to create. [off camera] Better cover your nads. It may get a little non-Newtonian in here."
Overclockwise,Ron Whitey," Not only have the defendants failed to rebut the charges, they've not even presented any mitigating factors to recommend leniency. It strikes me as an extra-risky strategy."
Overclockwise,Hyper-Chicken," Did you say ""extra-crispy recipe""?"
Overclockwise,Ron Whitey, You know I didn't.
Overclockwise,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour... If we could locate Bender Rodríguez, he would testify that my clients acted without malice."
Overclockwise,Fry," No, 'e wouldn't. Bender doesn't care about us anymore."
Overclockwise,Zoidberg, Someone used to care about me?! Hooray!
Overclockwise,Ron Whitey," In that case, the jury will begin its deliberations. Bailiff, [off camera] release the jury collies."
Overclockwise,Mom, I finally nailed Farnsworth. Destroyin' the boy is just icing on the cake.
Overclockwise,Larry," No one destroys a boy like you, Mother."
Overclockwise,Mom," Thank you, you repulsive disappointment."
Overclockwise,Fry, Any word from Leela?
Overclockwise,Amy, I heard she took a job selling deep-space real estate. Somewhere beyond the most distant thing ever observed with a telescope.
Overclockwise,Fry, [sad] She always liked not being observed with a telescope.
Overclockwise,Ron Whitey, Order. Order in the head.
Overclockwise,Bender," For reasons beyond even my comprehension, I 'ave returned to testify on behalf of the defendants."
Overclockwise,Farnsworth, Yay!
Overclockwise,Cubert," Yay, Bender!"
Overclockwise,Fry, [happy] I knew 'e cared about us!
Overclockwise,Hermes, You said you knew he didn't care about us!
Overclockwise,Fry, Leave me alone.
Overclockwise,Yellow and red lawyer," Your Honour, I object to this surprise witness. 'E's too surprising!"
Overclockwise,Ron Whitey, Sustained. Testimony has closed.
Overclockwise,Bender, But— Your Honour—
Overclockwise,Ron Whitey, Silence! One more in-burst like that an' I'll have this courtroom removed from you! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Overclockwise,Bender," [sad] I'm sorry, guys. I didn't realise I was late. I guess I'm not as smart as everybody thought."
Overclockwise,Farnsworth, I was born in prison and I'll die in prison.
Overclockwise,Bender, There is still one hope. You're co-defendants. An' the jury might not wanna convict a twelve-year-old.
Overclockwise,Mom, Son of a nerd. He may be right! Make sure Farnsworth doesn't get off easy on account o' that snot-gobbling twerp.
Overclockwise,Ron Whitey, 'As the jury reached a verdict?
Overclockwise,Fishy Joe," Not just any verdict, Your Honour. A great verdict!"
Overclockwise,Mom, [frightened] They're going to take pity on him! [angry] Do something!
Overclockwise,Yellow and red lawyer," Your Honour, prosecution moves to drop the charges against Cubert Farnsworth."
Overclockwise,Ron Whitey, Very well. The case against Cubert Farnsworth is hereby dismissed.
Overclockwise,Cubert, Told ya I'd get away with it.
Overclockwise,Ron Whitey," That'll do, pig. Please read the verdict against Professor Farnsworth."
Overclockwise,Fishy Joe," You got it, Judge. I think you'll find this verdict as fair as it is cruel."
Overclockwise,Bender," [off camera] Your Honour, [on camera] I move for a mistrial on grounds of double jeopardy. Cubert Farnsworth cannot be tried twice for the same crime! Cubert is the Professor's clone. Ergo, they are legally the same person. Since you dismissed the charges against Cubert, you cannot convict the Professor of these same charges!"
Overclockwise,Hyper-Chicken," Well, I'll be a nugget's uncle. He's right!"
Overclockwise,Ron Whitey, What a brilliant legal shenanigan! Case dismissed.
Overclockwise,Zoidberg, Yay!
Overclockwise,Fry, Yay!
Overclockwise,Hermes, Yes!
Overclockwise,Fry," Bender, you knew all this would happen, didn't you?"
Overclockwise,Bender, Yes. All except this part.
Overclockwise,Mom," If I can't bring down Farnsworth, I can at least dumb down 'is Robot. Take 'im away and reset 'im to factory-stupid condition!"
Overclockwise,Fry," Bender, wait. While you can still calculate the future, just tell me  What's gonna happen with me an' Leela?"
Overclockwise,Bender," There's no time now. Quick, Zoidberg! Take three steps to your right!"
Overclockwise,Nibbler," [sad] We've had some tough times, [happy] but at least we won a Tony!"
Overclockwise,Zoidberg, You won a Tony. Feh!
Overclockwise,Fry, Wow. You gave up your superintelligence to save us. Why did you come back?
Overclockwise,Bender," Honestly, I couldn't think o' one good reason. But some decisions can't be made by thinking. Even if you're drunk! No galaxies there."
Overclockwise,Leela, Knock knock.
Overclockwise,Bender, Oh! Oh! Who's there?!
Overclockwise,Fry, Leela?!
Overclockwise,Farnsworth, Yay!
Overclockwise,Bender, Leela who?!
Overclockwise,Fry, [off camera] It's good [on camera] to see you. [sad] Is it good to see me?
Overclockwise,Leela, Of course.
Overclockwise,Amy," [off camera] Come on in, Leela! [on camera] Take that ugly coat off!"
Overclockwise,Leela," Thanks. Hi, everybody."
Overclockwise,Hermes, So... Tell us. How's the intergalactic real estate going?
Overclockwise,Leela," Pretty good. I just sold a castle to the King of Space. But, somehow, I keep finding myself thinking about this place. An' things."
Overclockwise,Fry, [off camera] Things [on camera] like me or... Things like this badminton racket?
Overclockwise,Leela," You, Fry. Bender, while you still have your giant brain, please... Tell me  If Fry an' I ended up together—"
Overclockwise,Fry," It's too late, Leela. He's good, old Bender again. 'E's totally useless."
Overclockwise,Bender," Well, not totally! Before they reset me, I figured out the answers to life's great questions. Uh... This is the reason we exist. This is which ceilin' fans are gonna fall. Aha! Found it! Fry and Leela's Ultimate Fate... By Bender."
Overclockwise,Fry," Uh, it's probably better if we don't know. Uh, mystery of life and whatnot."
Overclockwise,Leela, Gimme that!
Overclockwise,,
Reincarnation,,
Reincarnation,Galactic Entity," A wise man once said that nothing really dies. It just comes back in a new form. Then he died. So, next time you see a lowly salamander, think twice before you step on it. It might be you. Stand by for ""Reincarnation""."
Reincarnation,Planet Express headquarters," 'Owdy, folks! Come on in!"
Reincarnation,Leela," [singing] Jumpin' Joe an' golly jeeper,"
Reincarnation,I got one gigantic peeper.,
Reincarnation,"Sassafras an' banana oil,",
Reincarnation,I'm a bee-youtiful purple-haired goyl.,
Reincarnation,Bender, Watch it!
Reincarnation,Fry," Oh, it's just that I love Leela something awful. Do you think a space-age dame like her would ever marry a two-bit, low-life delivery boy like me an' also I 'ave bad posture and severe financial problems?"
Reincarnation,Bender, Have you tried gettin' 'er pregnant?
Reincarnation,Fry," Gosh, yes. I've tried an' tried, but, so far, I only got Amy pregnant."
Reincarnation,Bender, You know what your problem is? [He pushes his antenna down and a cigar suddenly appears in his mouth.] Too much smoke in your face.
Reincarnation,Fry," I wanna ask Leela to marry me, but I can't afford a diamond ring big enough to express my love."
Reincarnation,Bender, That's for sure. [Bender stretches his arm out and takes Fry's wallet from his pants pocket.] Not on the measly salary I steal from you each month.
Reincarnation,Horn loudspeaker," All crew, report to the laboratorium. Get a wiggle on."
Reincarnation,Fry," Thanks for the heads-up, Sparky."
Reincarnation,Horn loudspeaker, Mhm. Fish on Friday. An' Human flesh the rest of the week.
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," Movietone News, everyone. [He steps away from the telescope.] I've discovered a new comet!"
Reincarnation,Leela," One side, boys. Let a lady take a gander."
Reincarnation,Farnsworth, Hang on. Let me just adjust it to your eye level.
Reincarnation,Leela, [off camera] Holy matrimony! [on camera] That's one flashy rock!
Reincarnation,Farnsworth, Indeed. It's pure diamondium!
Reincarnation,Fry, Um... Would it be possible to break off a piece an' put it in an engagement ring for reasons that are private?
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," Oh, fuff! Nothing in the universe can fracture diamondium. Not even God 1 an' God 2 put together. But behold! [He takes out a large can from his lab coat. Close up on the can, which is labeled ""HOLOGRAM in SAUCE"". Farnsworth opens it with an old fashioned can opener. The can opens and pours out a hologram of the comet.] The tail is composed of abrasive comet powder. [He throws away the can.] And that's just what I need to put a washday shine on my new Doomsday device. [He suddenly picks up a very large doomday device with a skull and crossbones on it. Wide shot of the laboratorium. Nibbler is suddenly seen in baby clothes crawling on the widow's walk.] Now hop in the flivver and score me some o' that sweet, sweet powder."
Reincarnation,Hermes," Comet ahoy! [off camera] Why, it's lit up like a smooth, refreshing Chesterfield."
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," Get plenty of that powder. I want this bomb to sparkle like the floor at Grand Central Station. [He pulls a chain. A toilet can be heard flushing. He gets out of the radio carrying the Doomsday device, and it is in fact an outhouse.] Over and out."
Reincarnation,Amy," Watch it, ya stumblebums! You're boopin' my betty!"
Reincarnation,Fry, Um... I'll be back in a jiff. I gotta go check this comet for anarchists.
Reincarnation,Fry," Wouldja look at that gem! Slap that shiner on a ring an' me an' Leela will be doing the married, horizontal Charleston in no time."
Reincarnation,Fry," Alright, diamond. You won those rounds. But I've got an ace up my hole."
Reincarnation,Leela, I love this time of day. There's such a beautiful stillness.
Reincarnation,Fry," Leela, I don't know if words can describe how I feel about you—"
Reincarnation,Leela, Good?
Reincarnation,Fry," Huh. I guess they can. Anyhow, when a guy feels good about 'is sweetheart, 'e wants to prove it by giving 'er somethin' really... Good!"
Reincarnation,Leela," I'm still listenin', you big lug."
Reincarnation,Fry," What I'm tryin' to say is... In all the world, I couldn't find a diamond good enough for you. But then I found one out there... [Wide shot of the sky above New New York. The comet is floating above the sun.] Among the stars. The beautiful, affordable stars."
Reincarnation,Leela, You mean... When you disappeared up on the comet...
Reincarnation,Fry, Exactly.
Reincarnation,Leela, I thought you snuck off to take a dump.
Reincarnation,Fry, A man can sneak off to do two things.
Reincarnation,Leela," Oh, Fry!"
Reincarnation,Fry," In exactly ten seconds, the Doomsday device will blow the stone loose. An', if my calculations are correct, it will land here on your finger."
Reincarnation,Leela's finger, You've made me the happiest finger in the whole wide hand!
Reincarnation,Fry," Comet kaboomination in three, two—"
Reincarnation,Bird, Uh... Hello?! Cuckoo!
Reincarnation,Fry," The diamond still didn't break! [Fry sniffles.] [sad] Now, you'll never know 'ow much I love you. [Another explosion is heard, and gets the attention of Fry and Leela, who gasp. Close up on the comet, which breaks in half. One half begins to float towards the sun.] [continued, off camera] It went kersplitters!"
Reincarnation,Leela," Fry, I don't need a diamond. You've given me the most beautiful rainbow I've ever seen! All the colours of the spectrum!"
Reincarnation,Fry, [angry] Not beautiful enough! A swell gal like you deserves better!
Reincarnation,Leela," [off camera] What's that?! [on camera] Is my eye playing trick on me?! [Fry gasps.] It's so beautiful! Fry, you've created a new colour! Totally different from any other colour or combination of colours."
Reincarnation,Fry," Shucks. It's still only half as beautiful as you. [The two halves then finally meet, causing the rainbow to shatter into miniature diamonds, which falls onto New New York like snow.] Whoa!"
Reincarnation,Leela, Whoa! I wish this moment could last forever.
Reincarnation,Fry," Leela, my love, will you marry—"
Reincarnation,Alien," [off camera] Bernilla, my love, [on camera] will you marry me?"
Reincarnation,Bernilla, Blorg! Blorg! A thousand times blorg!
Reincarnation,Bender," Ba-da-ba-da-ba-dip-That's all you get, jerks!"
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," Good news, multiplayers! After a lifetime of toil, I'm on the verge of solving all the mysteries of science!"
Reincarnation,Bender, So we can leave early?
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," Certainly not! [Bender, who has turned red, complains. #+%$! flashes in front of Bender's mouth.] Not until I demonstrate this new microscope lens, [off camera] made from the debris of that diamondium comet."
Reincarnation,Bender," Eh, Professor."
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," [fed up, on camera] Yes, Bender?"
Reincarnation,Bender, Boo! [Professor Farnsworth screams and drops the lens on the floor. The floor turns black. The lens turns white and is shattered in seven pieces. A skull appears above it and disappears as it ascends. Bender laughs.] [quickly] Okay. Too bad. Goodbye.
Reincarnation,Farnsworth, You're not through with this level! I have another lens.
Reincarnation,Bender," [back to normal] Bite my 8-bit metal ass. [Bender turns to Hermes.] That's ""Bite"" with a Y."
Reincarnation,Hermes," Whatever you say, mon."
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," Due to the lens' remarkable quark-lattice structure, [off camera] it should be capable of unthinkable magnification! [The lens rotates. Scruffy, Zoidberg, Fry, and Leela are also sitting at the conference table and are looking forward.] Come. [Professor Farnsworth stands up.] Follow me to the lab."
Reincarnation,Bender," Hey, I'm gonna try that! So long, meatbags! Son of a—"
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," Eh, let me just insert [off camera] lens in microscope. [on camera] There! Now, for the first time, we may be able to see the infinitesimal fabric of matter itself. [off camera] Laying bare the most fundamental laws of the universe!"
Reincarnation,Leela," [sexfully] Hey, Fry. I know something you could lay bare."
Reincarnation,Fry, [angry] Leela! Shhh! I'm tryin' to listen to a physics lecture!
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," [on camera] Now, to examine some matter. Any old matter will do."
Reincarnation,Hermes," [off camera] Mon, that's some cheap-ass matter! [on camera] What the hell is it?"
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," [off camera] Oh, [on camera] it's just a log I found in a hole in the bottom of the sea. Now, to penetrate its deepest mysteries."
Reincarnation,Leela," [sexfully] Hey, Fry."
Reincarnation,Fry, [angry] Leela! No means no!
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," Oh, my! There's a frog on a bump on this log that I found in a hole in the bottom of the sea!"
Reincarnation,Leela, An' that's the ultimate secret of the universe?!
Reincarnation,Farnsworth, Apparently so. Wait! There's a snail on the tail of the frog on the bump on this log that I found in a hole in the bottom of the sea!
Reincarnation,Hermes, Dear Eliza!
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," [off camera] The snail itself is composed of cells, molecules, atoms..."
Reincarnation,Fry, Pfff! Those things don't rhyme!
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," [on camera] Things only rhyme below ten to the minus five angstroms, you dope! [off camera] Now, ions an' pions, muons an' gluons, neutrinos, gravitinos... [on camera] We're closing in on the very smallest particles of matter! For the first time, we're about to observe the fundamental structure of the universe. [off camera] Such detail. [on camera] Such finely wrought intricate beauty!"
Reincarnation,Leela, It's like staring into the face of God!
Reincarnation,Scruffy, It's a mirror into Scruffy's soul.
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," This explains everything! Even the Big Bang that created the universe! All that's left is the mathematics! Put down h-bar, uh, carry the infinity, and— My-reka! There it is! The Grand Unified Theory! Reducing all the laws of nature to a single equation!"
Reincarnation,Amy," Professor, you did it! You solved the problem that baffled Einstein an' drove Stephen Hawking to quit physics and become a cartoon voice actor!"
Reincarnation,Stephen Hawking's head," I like physics, but I love cartoons."
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," This is the greatest moment in scientific history! At last, there are no more questions left to answer!"
Reincarnation,Stephen Hawking's head, Yay!
Reincarnation,Amy, Yay!
Reincarnation,Hermes," Woohoo! Alright! Well done, Professor. Okay. Back to work, everyone."
Reincarnation,Farnsworth, Wait. There are no more questions left to answer.
Reincarnation,Farnsworth, Oh.
Reincarnation,Morbo, And those are today's high scores. Linda?
Reincarnation,Linda," Thanks, Morbo. Coming up next, Galaxians. What you need to know to protect your family."
Reincarnation,Farnsworth, How do you people do it? How do you go on knowing there's nothing more to know?!
Reincarnation,Fry, I watch TV. It's the next best thing to bein' alive.
Reincarnation,Farnsworth, What's the use? I'm just not capable of the happiness of the dumb. If only I'd made some mistake!
Reincarnation,Stephen Hawking's head, You didn't. I checked the invariance of your Lagrangian. Hubba-hubba.
Reincarnation,Farnsworth, Then there's nothing left to do! Nothing!
Reincarnation,Bender, Would it cheer you up if I punched Fry in the groin? 'Cause I'll do it. Regardless. Body blow! Body blow!
Reincarnation,Farnsworth, I devoted every waking minute to answering the fundamental questions of science.
Reincarnation,Farnsworth, [off camera] I never married.
Reincarnation,Farnsworth, [off camera] Rarely went outside!
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," [on camera] And, now that I've found all the answers, I realise that what I was living for were the questions!"
Reincarnation,Fry," That stinks, Professor. Too bad the universe made it turn out that way and not some other way. I wonder why it did that."
Reincarnation,Stephen Hawking's head, Probably magnets.
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," Shut up, Hawking. Fry, you idiot! [happy] You're a genius! Why are the laws of physics what they are? Instead of some other laws? To find out, we'd have to recreate the conditions before the Big Bang. It would take decades of work by thousands of scientists in a particle accelerator powered by dump trucks of flaming grant money. [back to normal] Of course, there'd be no guarantee of success. [sad] And, in any case, I'd never live to see it."
Reincarnation,Leela, I'm surprised you lived through that sentence.
Reincarnation,Hermes," Sorry you wasted your life, Professor. I guess you never know everything after all."
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," Indeed. The pursuit of knowledge is hopeless and eternal. [happy, screaming] Hooray!"
Reincarnation,Amy," [happy, screaming] Yay!"
Reincarnation,Hermes," [happy, screaming] Yeah-heah!"
Reincarnation,Bender," [happy, screaming] Woohoo! Alright! Yay!"
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," [back to normal, voiced by David Herman] Action Delivery Force, assemble!"
Reincarnation,Bender," [back to normal] And me, Mighty Merchandise Robot!"
Reincarnation,Transition Announcer," [off camera] Meanwhile, on Space Planet 4, the Aliens who communicate by dancing..."
Reincarnation,Transition Announcer," [continued, off camera] Were worshipping a giant comet."
Reincarnation,Subtitle, All hail great comet! Beloved mascot of popular shrimp crunch snack! Also God. Foreigners killed our God! Many words of disapproval!
Reincarnation,Leela," [back to normal] Team assembled! [Leela points at Professor Farnsworth.] What is that box, you old witch?"
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," Ha ha ha! I'll never tell you. [Professor Farnsworth has stood up.] It's a deep space-emotion detector. [Strips showing the faces of Leela, Fry, Hermes, Zoidberg, Amy, and Bender appear on the screen as they gasp. In the machine, the heart stops beating.] The detector can tell you're impressed. You should be! [In the machine, the parabolic antenna whirls around and points up, the heart begins beating very fast, and the screen shows a green graph. An alarm goes off as the graph turns red.] Wha? The marvellous device. It's detecting a massive burst of anger. From deep space!"
Reincarnation,Subtitle, There is Earth! Attack it as previously discussed!
Reincarnation,Fry, Flying bananas? Ha ha! I will slice them on my morning fish porridge.
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," This is no time for one of your jokes, Fry."
Reincarnation,Fry, I will tell you something that's no joke. [Fry stands up and puts on a helmet.] I will lead the defence fight.
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," Ha ha ha ha! Don't make me laugh. If we fight, we'll surely be destroyed."
Reincarnation,Hermes, Then what is our only hope?!
Reincarnation,Amy," We must summon Zagtar, defender of space!"
Reincarnation,Hermes, You forget!
Reincarnation,Hermes, [off camera] Zagtar was destroyed by the crystal space devil!
Reincarnation,Leela," [off camera] The crystal space devil was once my brother, Prince Hiroshi."
Reincarnation,Leela, [on camera] I mourn his loss. But what matters now is protecting Earth from that fruit armada.
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," I see your mother, the water Mutant, didn't raise any fools, Turanga Leela. Our only hope is to communicate with the Aliens. And show them our peaceful intentions."
Reincarnation,Bender, Perhaps they speak perfect English... As do we.
Reincarnation,Farnsworth, We can't take that chance! We'll need my universal auto-translator!
Reincarnation,Farnsworth, [off camera] This [on camera] is my universal auto-translator!
Reincarnation,Fry, That will show them our peaceful intentions.
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," The only question is, ""Who should [off camera] be our spokesman?!"""
Reincarnation,Zoidberg, Me! Me! Choose Zoidberg.
Reincarnation,Fry," Zoidberg, a diplomat? The list of things I've heard now contains everything."
Reincarnation,Zoidberg," Hear my words. My shell may be tough like a samurai honeymoon mask, but inside I'm as soft and sensitive as a girl made of custard!"
Reincarnation,Cubert, [happy] Custard time?! [screaming] Hooray!
Reincarnation,Zoidberg, Please! I am certain I will succeed with my delicate manner. Oops.
Reincarnation,Leela," Instead, I will send the peace transmission. Most honoured visitors, we greet you in peace."
Reincarnation,Subtitle," Why does it flap its face hole? I am puzzled, for we don't know what mouths are. It's a threat! Destruct them!"
Reincarnation,Hattie, Kajigeru desu!
Reincarnation,Farnsworth, All attempts to communicate with the Aliens have failed. I fear our only option is thrilling space battle.
Reincarnation,Bender and Fry," Power friends, go!"
Reincarnation,Male voice, Launch all missiles! Launch all missiles!
Reincarnation,Farnsworth, We were defeated in battle.
Reincarnation,Bender," [off camera] Oh, no! They're forming Gigatron!"
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," Defeat is ours. If we can't communicate with these bone-jelly ghosts, we're doomed!"
Reincarnation,Amy," Professor, I 'ave analysed the Aliens' movements with this movement analyser."
Reincarnation,Farnsworth, That device was a gift from my ancestors. Go on.
Reincarnation,Amy, It seems their movements are a form of language. Rather than speaking Ja—
Reincarnation,Transition Announcer, English!
Reincarnation,Amy," [continued] Like us, they speak by dancing."
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," Of course! Having no mouths our ears, they could only communicate through motions!"
Reincarnation,Fry, Or perhaps by odours!
Reincarnation,Bender, That is 'ow you communicate!
Reincarnation,"Amy, Leela, Fry, Bender, and Hermes", Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Reincarnation,Leela, Then our only hope to talk to them is by doing a peace dance. But it will have to be smoother an' more fluid than any movement mankind is capable of.
Reincarnation,Fry, What if we hire a buttered geisha?
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," Another one of your ill-timed jokes, Fry?!"
Reincarnation,Fry, You an' I are enemies now!
Reincarnation,Zoidberg," Hear my words. I believe I, the most humble member of Action Delivery Team, could do such a dance!"
Reincarnation,Hermes," Surely, your heart shell is too rigid! I call on anyone but you to do the peace dance!"
Reincarnation,Zoidberg, [sad] Aw.
Reincarnation,Bender," Of course, I will do the peace dance. But I will need 'elp."
Reincarnation,Bender and Fry," Super Dance Squad, initiate!"
Reincarnation,Amy, We all hope they're communicating a peaceful message!
Reincarnation,Subtitle," Hey Aliens, we will kill you! And dishonor your widows by making them gather wood! Fire a the weapon!"
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," Wha, wha?! We thought we were so smart with our science and dancing, but look at us now  At Gigatron's mercy!"
Reincarnation,Zoidberg, The shame is too great. It's time to end this! Huh-yah! Feh!
Reincarnation,Leela," [off camera] Zoidberg, [on camera] stop! We are too scared right now to enjoy the ceremony of your death!"
Reincarnation,Zoidberg," No hara-kiri today, but heiwa no dansu! The gelatinous dance of peace!"
Reincarnation,Hermes," You may be gelatinous, but not even the Mochi Phanton could perform such intricate motions!"
Reincarnation,Zoidberg," Says you, salaryman!"
Reincarnation,Subtitle, What is the medical crab doing?
Reincarnation,Zoidberg, Behold! The dance of peace!
Reincarnation,Bender, The dance is so complex! The eye can barely follow it!
Reincarnation,Zoidberg," I may be the humblest Team member, but I have given it my all."
Reincarnation,Amy," I underestimated you, medical crab. But will the Aliens understand?!"
Reincarnation,Subtitle, We have understand peace.
Reincarnation,Subtitle," Farewell, Action Team."
Reincarnation,Farnsworth," Zoidberg, you are the greatest hero. You saved us all."
Reincarnation,Zoidberg, For now. But another threat from the stars is sure to arise next week at the same time!
Reincarnation,Leela, Until then...
Reincarnation,Bender and Fry, Action Delivery Force star-hero rocket engage!
Reincarnation,,
When Aliens Attack,Fry," Pizza delivery! Wow, so this is a real TV station, huh?"
When Aliens Attack,Technician," Well, it's a Fox affiliate."
When Aliens Attack,Fry, What are you showing right now?
When Aliens Attack,Technician, Single Female Lawyer. It's the season finale. Wanna watch?
When Aliens Attack,Fry," Ah, I dunno. That's a chick show. I prefer programmes of the genre ""world's blankiest blank""."
When Aliens Attack,Technician, She is wearing the world's shortiest skirt.
When Aliens Attack,Fry, I'm in!
When Aliens Attack,Judge," [on TV] Counselor, I remind you that it's unethical to sleep with your client. If you really care about the outcome of the case, you should sleep with me."
When Aliens Attack,Single Female Lawyer," [on TV] Your Honour, it's bad enough to proposition a single female lawyer in court, but this is a unisex bathroom."
When Aliens Attack,Judge," [on TV] Overruled, counselor!"
When Aliens Attack,Stenographer, [on TV] Could you repeat that last part?
When Aliens Attack,Technician," Oh, my God! You've knocked Fox of the air!"
When Aliens Attack,Fry, Pft! Like anyone on Earth cares.
When Aliens Attack,Stenographer, [on TV] Could you repeat that last par--
When Aliens Attack,Lrrr, This is an outrage! I demand to know what happened to the plucky lawyer and her compellingly short garment.
When Aliens Attack,Announcer," [voice-over; on TV] Due to technical difficulties, we now bring you eight animated shows in a row."
When Aliens Attack,Hermes," What in the name of Bob Marley's ghost? Get to work, you lazy boat bag!"
When Aliens Attack,Bender, Ow!
When Aliens Attack,Fry," Ow! Hey, quit it, Hermes. It's Labor Day."
When Aliens Attack,Hermes, Labor Day? That phoney-baloney holiday crammed down our throats by fat-cat union gangsters?
When Aliens Attack,Fry, That's the one.
When Aliens Attack,Hermes," Hot damn, a day off!"
When Aliens Attack,Leela, Who's up for one last summer beach trip?
When Aliens Attack,Bender," Aw, yeah!"
When Aliens Attack,Hermes," Ready, Freddy!"
When Aliens Attack,Fry," [unenthusiastic] Eh, I think I'll just stay here."
When Aliens Attack,Leela," Fry, you're wasting your life sitting in front of that TV. You need to get out and see the real world."
When Aliens Attack,Fry, But this is HDTV. It's got better resolution than the real world!
When Aliens Attack,Leela, Everyone's too polite to say anything but you're covered with bed sores.
When Aliens Attack,Fry, Not covered!
When Aliens Attack,Leela, Just get in the car.
When Aliens Attack,Farnsworth," Ah, here we are  Monument Beach!"
When Aliens Attack,Fry," Wait, Mount Rushmore and the Leaning Tower of Pisa? I didn't know they were both in New York!"
When Aliens Attack,Leela," They are now. In the 2600's, New Yorkers elected a super-villain governor, and he stole most of the world's monuments."
When Aliens Attack,Bender, Truly a great man. Look at him up there.
When Aliens Attack,Hermes, Aha! [He puts the metal detector down and digs in the sand.] Found you!
When Aliens Attack,Bender," OK, now you go hide. [Hermes puts the trowel down and hands Bender the metal detector and runs off. Bender throws the metal detector away and chuckles.] Nice knowin' you."
When Aliens Attack,Farnsworth," Come on, Zoidberg, I passed it right to you."
When Aliens Attack,Zoidberg, I've had it with this game! I'm going for a scuttle!
When Aliens Attack,Bender," OK, everyone, come and get it!"
When Aliens Attack,Fry," Ah, just like my dad used to make ... until McDonald's fired him."
When Aliens Attack,Bender," Bite my red-hot glowing ass. [Smoke rises from behind him.] Wait a minute. Red-hot glowing ass? [He turns around and sees his red-hot glowing ass. He turns back to Fry.] [calmly] I'll be right back! [He gets up and runs into the sea, waving his arms around.] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! [His ass sizzles in the cool water.] Aw, yeah!"
When Aliens Attack,Amy," No, Nibbler! [Nibbler runs off with the burger and her bikini top. She gasps and covers herself with the burger buns.] [whispering] Psst, Professor, I need another bikini."
When Aliens Attack,Farnsworth," Eh ... wha? [He sees her.] Oh, oh, OK, I think there's one can left. [He reaches into a bag next to him and takes out a spray can and hands it to her. She sprays it over her making a brand new pink bikini.] Oh, my."
When Aliens Attack,Amy, There. How do I look?
When Aliens Attack,Farnsworth, Like a cheap French harlot.
When Aliens Attack,Amy, French?
When Aliens Attack,Bully," Say, doll-face, how'd you like to make time with a real man?"
When Aliens Attack,Leela, No. I'm not attracted to bullies. No matter how big and ... [He flexes his muscles.] ... handsome they are.
When Aliens Attack,Fry," It's OK, Leela, go ahead. I got a lot of work to do."
When Aliens Attack,Bully," Uh, sir, you don't understand. I'm a professional beach bully. I pretend to steal your girl, you punch me, I go down, she swoons, you slip me 50 bucks."
When Aliens Attack,Fry, 50 bucks? Not even if she was my girlfriend. You take her.
When Aliens Attack,Leela, Fry! Although I suppose we could go for a walk along the beach.
When Aliens Attack,Bully," Uh, no thanks, ma'am, I'm actually gay."
When Aliens Attack,Zoidberg," Uh-oh. [A lobster pot traps him.] Help! Help! [He knocks on the trap. Bender wanders by, whistling.] Bender, you gotta spring me. I'll never survive in here; I'm too pretty!"
When Aliens Attack,Bender," Alright, alright, I'll bust you out. [He bends the bars and spotlights shine on the pair and alarms beep.] Cheese it!"
When Aliens Attack,Fry," Voila. The greatest sandcastle ever built. This is the kind of castle King Arthur would have lived in, if he were a fiddler crab."
When Aliens Attack,Leela, It's very nice. We should get a picture before the tide comes in.
When Aliens Attack,Fry," Ooh, yeah. Anyone have a camera?"
When Aliens Attack,Bender," Right here, buddy. [His left eyelid covers his left eye and his right eye zooms out. The rest of the staff kneel next to the castle.] Wait, I wanna be in the picture too. [He takes his head off and puts it on the ground. He pushes his antenna down and it flashes like a timer. His body joins the staff.] Pretend you're happy."
When Aliens Attack,Zoidberg, Yay!
When Aliens Attack,Leela," Oh, my God!"
When Aliens Attack,Hermes, What in Babylon?
When Aliens Attack,Fry, [screaming] Nooo!
When Aliens Attack,Hermes, Faster!
When Aliens Attack,Fry," We're all gonna die, aren't we?"
When Aliens Attack,Farnsworth," Oh, I should think so. Although last time aliens invaded all they did was force the most intelligent of us to pair off and mate continuously. [chuffed] Oh, yes!"
When Aliens Attack,Linda," [on TV] Once again, today's winning lotto number was 4. In other news, alien saucers continue to rain destruction upon Earth. We now go live to an emergency address by Earth President McNeal."
When Aliens Attack,McNeal," [on TV] Ladies and gentlemen, our course is clear. The time has come to knuckle under. To get down on all fours and really lick boot. Give our alien masters whatever they want a--"
When Aliens Attack,Lrrr," [on TV] People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8. [He taps the mic and turns to his aides.] Is this thing on? [He blows into it and turns back to the camera.] Now then  We want the one you call ""McNeal"". Give us McNeal or we will lay waste to your cities with our anti-monument laser. We demand McNeal!"
When Aliens Attack,McNeal," [on TV] Uh, as I was saying ... [He clears his throat.] ... mankind would sooner perish than kowtow to outrageous alien demands for this McNeal ... whoever he is. Am I right? [The representatives murmur to each other.] And now, the man who will lead us in our proud struggle for freedom, fresh from his bloody triumph over the pacifists of the Gandhi Nebula, 25-star General Zapp Brannigan!"
When Aliens Attack,Man, [cheering; on TV] Yeah!
When Aliens Attack,Bender," Hey, look, Leela, it's that idiotic windbag you slept with."
When Aliens Attack,Leela, The Earth is under attack. Can't we just forget about that?
When Aliens Attack,Bender, Evidently not.
When Aliens Attack,Zapp," [on TV] Call me cocky, but if there's an alien out there I can't kill, I haven't met him and killed him yet. But I can't go it alone. [He looks into the camera.] That's why I'm ordering every available ship to report for duty. Anyone without a ship should secure a weapon and fire wildly into the air."
When Aliens Attack,Leela," Well, you heard the windbag  We've been drafted. Everyone into the ship."
When Aliens Attack,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. I refuse to fight. I'm a conscientious objector."
When Aliens Attack,Fry, A what?
When Aliens Attack,Bender," You know, a coward."
When Aliens Attack,Zapp," [on TV] Since this is an emergency, all robots will now have their patriotism circuits activated."
When Aliens Attack,Bender," It is every robot's duty to give his life for the good of humanity. [His antenna stops flashing.] Oh, crap!"
When Aliens Attack,Zapp," We're all from different cultures here. Some of you are white, some of you are black. [He stops by a man and points at him.] You're brown. [He moves on to Bender.] And you're silver. But I don't care if your skin's red or tan or Chinese. You're all going to have to learn to die together. [He looks back at Bender.] Am I right, soldier?"
When Aliens Attack,Bender," Well, actually, I-- [Zapp presses the remote again and Bender's antenna flashes and beeps.] Sir, yes, sir! Sir!"
When Aliens Attack,Zapp," Remember, our mission is simple  Destroy all aliens!"
When Aliens Attack,Kif," Um, uh, not me, sir."
When Aliens Attack,Zapp," Oh, yes, right. Nobody destroy Kif. [quietly] Unless you have to. [He sees Leela.] [talking] Oh, ho, ho! The luscious Captain Leela. [He starts rubbing his hands.] This is turning into one very sex-ay struggle for the future of the human race!"
When Aliens Attack,Leela," Thanks, but I'm not technically human."
When Aliens Attack,Zapp," Right, right. Nobody destroy Leela either."
When Aliens Attack,Zapp," The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well-made bed. You will practise until you can make your bed in your sleep."
When Aliens Attack,Fry, You mean while I'm sleeping in it?
When Aliens Attack,Zapp," You won't have time for sleeping, soldier. Not with all the bed-making you'll be doing."
When Aliens Attack,Zapp," The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. [Kif sighs and turns to a computer.] Now, like all great plans, my strategy is so simple an idiot could have devised it. On my command, all ships will line up and file directly into the alien death cannons, clogging them with wreckage."
When Aliens Attack,Fry, W-Wouldn't it make more sense to send the robots in first a--
When Aliens Attack,Bender," Sir, I volunteer for a suicide mission. [His antenna stops flashing and he bangs his head with his knuckles.] Aw, cut it out!"
When Aliens Attack,Zapp," You're a brave robot, son. But when I'm in command every mission's a suicide mission. Which reminds me. [He walks over to where Leela is sitting and puts his foot on the seat next to her. She folds her arms and isn't impressed.] Leela, perhaps before we head into battle you'd like to make love to me, in case one of us doesn't come back."
When Aliens Attack,Leela," Maybe we should wait till afterwards, in case neither of us comes back."
When Aliens Attack,Zapp, Here's hoping.
When Aliens Attack,Fry," I'm gonna be a science-fiction hero, just like Uhura, or Captain Janeway, or Xena!"
When Aliens Attack,Leela," [on screen] Fry, this isn't TV, it's real life. Can't you tell the difference?"
When Aliens Attack,Fry," Sure, I just like TV better."
When Aliens Attack,Leela," Bender, damage report."
When Aliens Attack,Bender," The auxiliary power's out, and they spilled my cocktail."
When Aliens Attack,Fry," Alright, scumwads. This one's for Bender's cocktail!"
When Aliens Attack,Leela, We did it! We won!
When Aliens Attack,Bender," [sadly] Yeah, but it'll never bring back my martini. [He opens his chest cabinet.] [normal] Well, who wants a martini?"
When Aliens Attack,Zapp," [on screen] Good work, everyone. The mothership is destroyed."
When Aliens Attack,Zapp, What the hell is that thing?
When Aliens Attack,Kif, It appears to be the mothership.
When Aliens Attack,Zapp, Then what did we just blow up?
When Aliens Attack,Kif, The Hubble Telescope.
When Aliens Attack,Zapp," [shouting] Stop exploding, you cowards!"
When Aliens Attack,Leela," This is hopeless. [She runs to the pilot's seat and sits down.] If we're gonna get blown to bits, we might as well do it in the comfort of our own home."
When Aliens Attack,Farnsworth," You'll be the captain, you'll be the delivery boy, and you'll be the alcoholic, foul-mouthed-- [The door behind him opens and the real crew walk in.] Oh, God, you're alive. I mean, thank God you're alive! [He turns back to the others.] Sorry, check back in three days, a week at the most."
When Aliens Attack,Lrrr, [on TV] We want McNeal! Stop stalling!
When Aliens Attack,Linda, [on TV] And now a rebuttal from President McNeal.
When Aliens Attack,McNeal, [on TV] The people of Earth remain united in my refusal to hand over myself. Total annihilation is a small price to pay compared with--
When Aliens Attack,Zapp, [shouting] Here he is! Come and get him!
When Aliens Attack,Lrrr, You are not McNeal.
When Aliens Attack,Zapp, [simultaneous] Huh?
When Aliens Attack,McNeal, [simultaneous] Huh?
When Aliens Attack,Nd-Nd, You are not the one we want.
When Aliens Attack,McNeal," [grovelling] Oh, thank you. Thank you, glorious masters! I--"
When Aliens Attack,Lrrr, Give us McNeal!
When Aliens Attack,Zapp, That was McNeal.
When Aliens Attack,Nd-Nd," No, McNeal, the single female lawyer."
When Aliens Attack,Lrrr, She wears miniskirts and is promiscuous.
When Aliens Attack,Zapp, [sexfully] Really?
When Aliens Attack,Fry, Miniskirts? That sounds familiar.
When Aliens Attack,Lrrr, Surely you know McNeal. She is an unmarried human female struggling to succeed in a human male's world.
When Aliens Attack,Zapp, Maybe that's just her excuse for being incompetent.
When Aliens Attack,Lrrr, [shouting] Silence! [talking] We will accept no more decoys. [He holds up a headshot of the single female lawyer.] This is the McNeal.
When Aliens Attack,Fry," Wait, I know her."
When Aliens Attack,Leela," You do not, you big fat liar. You don't know anyone. All you do is watch TV."
When Aliens Attack,Fry," That's where I know her from. She's Jenny McNeal. She was a character on a TV show back in the 20th century, Single Female Lawyer."
When Aliens Attack,Bender," Well if they're hoping to see a TV show that hasn't existed for a thousand years, pft, they are royally boned."
When Aliens Attack,Lrrr," [on TV] We will raise your planet's temperature by one million degrees a day, for five days, unless we see McNeal at 9pm tomorrow -- 8 central!"
When Aliens Attack,Farnsworth, [disappointed] I'm beginning to think there'll be no forced mating at all.
When Aliens Attack,Leela, They're going to destroy the entire Earth if they don't see some stupid TV show about some bimbo lawyer?
When Aliens Attack,Fry, It's crazy! How could they even know about a show from a thousand years ago?
When Aliens Attack,Farnsworth," Well, Omicron Persei 8 is about a thousand light years away. So the electro-magnetic waves would just recently have gotten there. You see--"
When Aliens Attack,Fry, Magic. Got it.
When Aliens Attack,Amy, Check this out  Back in 1999 the season finale of Single Female Lawyer was interrupted by technical problems. Apparently some zidiot spilled Coke on the transmitter.
When Aliens Attack,Fry, Beer-- I would think.
When Aliens Attack,Bender, They must just wanna see that episode. Let's find a tape and give it to 'em.
When Aliens Attack,Amy, There aren't any copies left.
When Aliens Attack,Farnsworth," No, there wouldn't be. Most videotapes from that era were damaged in 2443 during the Second Coming of Jesus."
When Aliens Attack,Fry," Y'know, I saw the first 30 seconds of that episode. If I could make up an ending, maybe we could act it out ourselves."
When Aliens Attack,Zoidberg, I could make the costumes.
When Aliens Attack,Farnsworth, I have an old five-megawatt broadcasting tower in the attic.
When Aliens Attack,Bender," [dramatically] And I, I could be an acting coach!"
When Aliens Attack,Fry, Let's put on a show.
When Aliens Attack,Fry," OK, Leela, you'll be starring as Jenny--"
When Aliens Attack,Leela," Uh-uh, forget it. A, I'm camera shy; and B, I get tongue tied in front of an audience armed with death rays."
When Aliens Attack,Amy," Plus, you don't really have the thighs for a miniskirt."
When Aliens Attack,Leela, Gimme the script.
When Aliens Attack,Fry," Places, everyone."
When Aliens Attack,Amy, OK ... all set!
When Aliens Attack,Fry, Lights! [Bender opens his chest cabinet and a bright studio light shines from it.] Camera one! [Bender's right eye extends and whirrs.] Camera two! [Bender's left eye extends and whirrs.] Camera three!
When Aliens Attack,Lrrr," Prepare the water cooler, that we may gather around it later and discuss things."
When Aliens Attack,Bender," [singing; on TV] Single Female Lawyer,"
When Aliens Attack,"Fighting for her client,",
When Aliens Attack,"[He swaps the sign to one that says ""Written and Directed by Fry"".]",
When Aliens Attack,"Wearing sexy miniskirts,",
When Aliens Attack,Bender, [singing] And being self-reliant.
When Aliens Attack,"(talking) Hey, I'm pretty good!",
When Aliens Attack,Farnsworth," Uh ... [reading] ... Jenny McNeal, you are charged with jury-tampering in last week's case ... [At the side of the set Fry watches on a TV screen that Bender is hooked up to. Bender scratches himself.] ... on account of your hot, naked affair with the foreman. How do you plead?"
When Aliens Attack,Leela," [reading] Your Honour, I move for a mistrial, on the grounds that I'm also having a hot, naked affair with the foreman of this jury."
When Aliens Attack,Hermes, [sexfully] I'll see you during the recess!
When Aliens Attack,Lrrr, If McNeal wishes to be taken seriously why does she not simply tear the judge's head off?
When Aliens Attack,Nd-Nd," It is true what they say; ""Women are from Omicron Persei 7, men are from Omicron Persei 9""."
When Aliens Attack,Farnsworth," [reading] Your witness, Prosecutor Ramirez."
When Aliens Attack,Zoidberg," Gracias. [He stands up with his script behind him and walks over to the witness box where Leela is sat.] Single Female Lawyer, where were you on the night of August 23rd?"
When Aliens Attack,Leela, Sleeping with you.
When Aliens Attack,Zoidberg, Aha!
When Aliens Attack,Leela," Uh, g-- uh, getting back to the, uh, matter, uh-uh, if it please the court... [whispering] Fry, there's nothing else here. You only wrote two pages of dialogue."
When Aliens Attack,Fry," Well, it took an hour to write. I thought it would take an hour to read."
When Aliens Attack,Leela, What are we supposed to do now?
When Aliens Attack,Fry," I don't know, I don't know. Just say anything. As long as it's compelling, mesmerising, a tour de force."
When Aliens Attack,Leela, Uh...
When Aliens Attack,Farnsworth," [reading] What say you, Single Female Lawyer?"
When Aliens Attack,Leela," I say ... I'm giving up the law. [She stands up.] And I'm giving up being single. Your Honour, will you marry me?"
When Aliens Attack,Fry," No, no! Go to commercial!"
When Aliens Attack,Bender, We'll be back after this word from Crazy Bender's Discount Stereo.
When Aliens Attack,Fry, Married? Jenny can't get married.
When Aliens Attack,Leela," Why not? It's clever, it's unexpected."
When Aliens Attack,Fry," But that's not why people watch TV. Clever things make people feel stupid, and unexpected things make them feel scared."
When Aliens Attack,Lrrr," [on TV]   Attention, McNeal. Your unexpected marriage plan scares us. You stole our hearts as a single female lawyer, and so shall you remain -- or else!"
When Aliens Attack,Fry, You see? TV audiences don't want anything original. They wanna see the same thing they've seen a thousand times before.
When Aliens Attack,Bender," [à la Arnold Jackson] Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Fry?"
When Aliens Attack,Fry," Trust me on this. While other people were out living their lives, I wasted mine watching TV, because deep down I knew it might one day help me save the world. Plus, I would have lost my Workman's Comp if I had gone outside. Now just read these cue cards."
When Aliens Attack,Fry, And action!
When Aliens Attack,Farnsworth," [reading] Miss McNeal, I'm afraid I must decline your offer of marriage. For, you see, I'm dying. Cough, then fall over dead."
When Aliens Attack,Zoidberg," [reading; unmoved] My God, he's dead."
When Aliens Attack,Leela, [reading] I will now make my closing statement. With my fiancé deceased ... [Farnsworth smiles weakly.] ... I hereby return to my single female lawyer career. No matter what any man says.
When Aliens Attack,Hermes, We find the defendant vulnerable yet spunky!
When Aliens Attack,Zoidberg, [cheering] Hooray!
When Aliens Attack,Amy, [cheering] Hooray!
When Aliens Attack,Fry, And ... cut!
When Aliens Attack,Bender," [singing] Single Female Lawyer,"
When Aliens Attack,Having lot's of sex--,
When Aliens Attack,(talking) Huh?,
When Aliens Attack,Lrrr," [on TV] Attention, McNeal. We are reasonably satisfied with the events we have seen. Overall I would rate it a C+, OK, not great. [Nd-Nd sees she is in the shot and runs offscreen.] As a result, we will not destroy your planet. But neither will we provide you with our recipe for immortality."
When Aliens Attack,Fry," Way to overact ,Zoidberg!"
When Aliens Attack,Lrrr," [on TV] And now we must return to our planet, to catch the end of a thousand-year-old Leno monologue."
When Aliens Attack,Bender," You did it, Fry!"
When Aliens Attack,Fry," Yep. [He turns the TV on, sits down on the couch and puts his feet up on the table.] It was just a matter of knowing the secret of all TV shows  At the end of the episode, everything's always right back to normal."
When Aliens Attack,,
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Calculon," [on TV] Honey unit, I'm home. [He gasps.] Monique!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Monique, [on TV] Calculon!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Calculon," [on TV] Oh, how I wish I could believe that. You may be my evil half-brother, but there's no law against murdering the other half."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Announcer #1, [voice-over; on TV] All My Circuits will be right back after this word from...
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Announcer #2, [voice-over; on TV] Slurm! It's highly addictive!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Trixie, [on TV] Look! It's Slurms MacKenzie!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Dixie, [on TV] He's the original party worm!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurms, [on TV] Whimmy-wham-wham-wazzle! Let's party!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender, Look at that worm go. Who says there are no more heroes?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurms," [on TV] Hey, dudes, you can win a chance to party with me, Slurms MacKenzie, at the Slurm bottling plant on planet Wormulon!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Announcer #2, [voice-over; on TV] Just look for the winning bottle-cap inside specially-marked cans of Slurm.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Trixie, I won!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Announcer #2, [fast voice-over; on TV] No purchase necessary unless you wish to enter the contest. Odds of winning mathematically insignificant.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, I like those odds. [Something rattles around in his can and he gasps. He empties it onto his hand. It's a tooth.] Rats. Just another tooth.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, I gotta find that golden bottle-cap.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, I've never seen anyone so addicted to Slurm.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, This is nothing. Back in high school I used to drink a hundred cans of cola a week. Right up until my third heart attack.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela," Bender, what's wrong?"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender, I'm sick.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, You poor baby. Let me check if you have a fever. [She puts the back of her hand against his head and it sizzles. She pulls it away quickly.] Ow!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Farnsworth," According to Bender's temperature gauge, which I suggest you use next time, Leela, he's running a fever of ... 900 degrees."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Hermes," Bender, mon, lie yourself down. [Bender lies on the couch and it bursts into flames. It burns away and leaves nothing but ash. Bender falls to the floor.] You're payin' for that!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Zoidberg," I'll have a look, but I remind you, I'm an expert on humans not robots."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry," I'm not Bender, I'm Fry."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Zoidberg, Really? I though you were the robot.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, Nope. Human.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Zoidberg," Alright, alright, spare me your life story. [He turns to Bender.] Now what seems to be the trouble?"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender, My tummy hurts and I've been having this burning electrical discharge.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Zoidberg," Hmm. Don't worry, you'll be fine. [He turns to the rest of the staff.] [muttering] Oh boy. [quietly] I didn't have the heart to tell him  It's fin fungus. He'll be floating upside-down by morning."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Amy," You should try homeopathic medicine, Bender. Take some zinc."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender, I'm 40% zinc.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Amy, Then take some Echinacea or a St. John's wort.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Farnsworth, Or a big fat placebo. It's all the same crap.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela," Hey, what's rattling around in there?"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Farnsworth," It may well be the cause of Bender's illness. But more importantly, it's a flimsy pretext to try out my latest invention. To the laboratory!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Farnsworth," I call this the F-ray. It's like an X-ray only it allows you to see through anything, even metal. Now, the neutrino beam it emits is a tad dangerous, so you'll all need protective goggles. [Amy, Hermes, Fry and Leela put on some goggles and gasp when they see Farnsworth putting on a full-body radiation suit. He picks up the F-ray and turns to Bender.] You may feel a slight stinging sensation -- all of you! [The crew look shocked and Farnsworth turns on the F-ray and shines it on Bender's casing. He adjusts it and the beam lights up Bender's inner workings. Farnsworth points the beam at Bender's head showing his CPU number, 6502, then he points it at his arms, feet and back to his body. A watch has jammed Bender's workings.] Aha! There's the cause of your illness."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Amy," Hey, that's my watch!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," I was wondering where I put that. [He puts his hand down his throat and hands Amy her watch through his door. He turns from the reddish colour back to his normal blue-grey colour.] Hey, now I feel much better! Thanks, Professor. And, Amy, I'm sorry I took your watch."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Farnsworth," Well, I've got to go take this suit to the decontaminators. You two lock up the F-ray and for the love of God don't let it fall into the wrong hands."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender, What should we point it at first?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, I 'unno. Try it on me. [Bender turns it on and points it at Fry's crotch. Fry doubles over in pain.] Ow! My sperm!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," Wow, neat! Mind if I try that again?"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry," Huh, didn't hurt that time."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," Whoa, mama! Hold still, sexy lady."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, What's wrong?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender, That's no lady!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,"""Fembot"""," Damn Chico! One more upgrade and I'll be more lady than you can handle! Why you so stupid, stupid?"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," Hey, bite my shiny metal ass!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,"""Fembot"""," You couldn't afford it, honey."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry," All this prolonged exposure to radiation is making me thirsty. [He sees a stack of Slurm cans in the corner. Next to them is a life-sized cardboard stand-up of Slurms MacKenzie and the babes. A speech bubble comes from Slurms' mouth with ""Win A Party With Me"" written on it. Fry picks up a can.] Ah, if only there was some way of knowing which can had the winning bottle-cap inside."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," Huh, w-what? I didn't hear you. I was too busy using this F-ray to look inside of things."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry," Wait a second. I'm getting an idea. N-No, false alarm. No. Yeah. No. Yeah. No. Wait. No. Yeah. Yeah. No ... no. Yes!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," Ah, this thing stinks."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry," We checked 90,000 cans of Slurm and all we won was this junk. [He points behind him to a cart full of Slurm merchandise including Slurm coats, a cooler of Slurm cans, eight Slurm blernsball caps, a Slurm motorbike and a Slurm jet-ski.] I never wanna see another can of Slurm again. Man, am I thirsty."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela," Fry, are you alright?"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," You did it, Fry! You found the winning bottle-cap! We won!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, [wheezy] Hooray!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela," Ooh, look at that!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender, Hey!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo," Welcome to the planet Wormulon. I'm Glurmo, your golly-rific guide to the splend-tacular Slurm factory."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, Uh-huh. Can we have our free Slurm now?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo," You'll have all the Slurm you can drink later on when you're partying with my good friend, Slurms MacKenzie."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurms," Alright! Whimmy-wham-wham-wazzle! Lay some skin on me, dudes!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," Wow! The original party worm! [Fry wipes the slime off on his trousers. Bender dances.] Are you ready to get down, get funky with us?"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo," He'd better be, that's what we pay him for. Right, Slurms?"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurms, Right!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo," In fact, Slurms has to party all night, every night, or he's fired!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurms, [tired] Rock on!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo," But before the party, you're all in for a fun-derful treat  A VIP tour of the Slurm factory!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurms," Enjoy the tour, dudes! [The leave and he droops over.] I'm gonna go lie down."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo," Welcome, my friends, to the wondrous world of whimsy that we like to call ""Slurms Centralised Industrial Fabrication Unit""."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Farnsworth," Oh, my!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender, Look! Flowers! And a boat!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Farnsworth, Who are those horrible orange creatures over there?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo," Why, those are the Grunka Lunkas. They work here in the Slurm factory."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Farnsworth, Tell them I hate them.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo," As we sail down the river of Slurm you'll see our mix-ologists at work. [He points to some Grunka Lunkas stirring cauldrons of yellow-orange stuff.] They take 900 of the finest ingredients, add a touch of child-like delight and mix it all with glacial spring water from our glacial spring water generator. [He points to a Grunka Lunka pumping water into a bucket from two containers labelled ""H2"" and ""O"".] Then, last of all, we add the secret ingredient that makes Slurm so deliciously addictive."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry," So, what's the secret ingredient?"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo, It's whatever your imagination wants it to be.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, Oh. But what is it really?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo," [sternly] That's not for you to know. [normal] Now, over here the Grunka Lunkas are inducing Wumpus berries to release their flavour, using sensual massage."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," [whispering] Psst, those berries. Those are the secret ingredient, right?"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo, No.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender, You positive?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo, Yes.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender, I'm just asking cause they look kind of secret.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo, Enough! There will be no further questions.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, Why?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela," Hey, look! The disgusting little men are starting to sing."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Grunka Lunkas," [singing] Grunka Lunka dunkity-do,"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,"We've got a friendly warning for you,",
Fry and the Slurm Factory,"Grunka Lunka dunkity-dasis,",
Fry and the Slurm Factory,The secret of Slurm's on a need-to-know basis.,
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Grunka Lunka #1, [singing] Asking questions in school is a great way to learn.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Grunka Lunka #2, [singing] If you try that stuff here you might get your legs broke.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Grunka Lunka #1, [singing] We once found a dead guy face down in the Slurm.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Grunka Lunka #2, [singing] It could easily happen again to you folks.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Grunka Lunkas," [singing] So keep you head down,"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,"And keep your mouth shut,",
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Grunka Lunka lunka dunkity dot!,
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo," [shouting] Hey, I don't pay you to sing! You just used up today's bathroom break!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Grunka Lunka #2, Hard ass.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo, [from boat] I heard that!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo," Now, on your right, you'll see the Slurm Master checking the Slurm for colour and bouquet."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, So thirsty.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo," Then he tastes it. He tastes it and tastes it, then tastes it some more."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry," Uh, could I have some Slurm, please?"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo, No food or drink allowed on the tour. You'll have to wait until you're partying with Slurms MacKenzie.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, When will that be?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo, Soon enough.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, That's not soon enough.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela," Hey, what's behind that door?"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo, Nothing.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, Is it the secret ingredient?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Grunka Lunkas," [singing] Grunka Lunka dunkity dingredient,"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,You should not ask about the secret ingredient.,
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," OK, OK, we get the point."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, I was just curious because of the armed guards.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Grunka Lunkas, [singing] Grunka Lunka dunkity darmed guards--
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender, [shouting] Shut the hell up!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Hermes, So you're telling me I could fire my whole staff and hire Grunka Lunkas at half the cost?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo, That's right. They think they have a good union but they don't. [whispering] They're basically slaves.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, What are you doing?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, I'm dying of thirst. Grab my feet and dunk my head in so I can drink.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, No. That's moronic.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, Fine. I'll let go and swim around in the Slurm and drink as much as I want. [He laughs and tumbles in. He waves his arms around.] Help! I can't swim!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela," Bender, why did you jump in?"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender, Everybody was doing it. I just wanted to be popular.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender, Ow!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, Where are we?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender, And why is the Slurm pouring into this sewer?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, This isn't Slurm at all!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, Something's rotten on the planet Wormulon. Look at this.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, This all must have something to do with the secret ingredient.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, My God. What if the secret ingredient ... is people?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, No. There's already a soda like that  Soylent Cola.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, Oh. How is it?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, It varies from person to person.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Farnsworth, Ooh!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Zoidberg, Do you have any that aren't so tight around the thorax?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo," Yes, over in-- Say, weren't there more people in your group at the start of the tour?"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Amy," Hey, yeah. Fry, Leela and Bender are missing."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo, If you'll excuse me.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, [whispering] Quick.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry," Look! Slurm! Finally! [He points at a conveyor belt with cans of Slurm on it. He walks over, picks up a can and drinks from it.] Oh, yeah! I'm never going 12 minutes without a Slurm again."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, It's the end of the line. This must be where they put in the secret ingredient.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry," Well, whatever it is, it's even better fresh. [He takes another swig.] Mmm, still warm."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, Ew!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, Blech!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," Oh, Lordy!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, Fry! [Fry realises what he is doing and spits the Slurm out and breathes a sigh of relief. Then he drinks some more.] Fry!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, That's the secret ingredient of Slurm?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, That's the only ingredient of Slurm.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, Ew!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," I'll save us! [He extends his arms and legs over the ravine and Fry and Leela run across him.] Oh, that feels good!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry," Thanks, Bender!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, [pointing] The exit! We made it.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," Uh, Your Majesty, I brought the prisoners."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Glurmo," Well, my curious friends, you learned the secret of Slurm. That concludes the portion of the tour where you stay alive."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela," You wish, you slimy worm! Hi-yah!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurm Queen," Good work, Glurmo. You have pleased your queen."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Small Glurmo #2," Thank you, Your Majesty."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Small Glurmo #1," Thanks, ma'am."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, How can you trick people into drinking something that comes out of your behind? It's disgusting.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurm Queen, Is it? Honey comes from a bee's behind. Milk comes from a cow's behind. And have you ever used toothpaste?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, Whose behind does that come from?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurm Queen, You don't wanna know.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," Look, we just came to party with Slurms MacKenzie. By the way, when is that scheduled?"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurm Queen, [shouting] Never! [Bender groans.] To the torture cave!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurm Queen," You, my metal friend, will have the honour of becoming 174 Slurm cans."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," Ah, this trip is turning into a big letdown."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurm Queen," As for you, you will be submerged in Royal Slurm which, in a matter of minutes, will transform you into a Slurm Queen like myself."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Small Glurmo #1," But, Your Highness, she's a commoner. Her Slurm will taste foul."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurm Queen," Yes! Which is why we'll market it as New Slurm. Then, when everyone hates it, we'll bring back Slurm Classic, and make billions!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, What about me?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurm Queen, You are free to go.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, Yes!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurm Queen," If you can resist this concentrated super Slurm! [The Glurmos grab him and sit him in a chair in front of a tub. The Slurm Queen fills the tub with a dark green slime.] It's so delicious, you'll eat until you explode! Oh, which reminds me, put a tarp over that sofa, will you? Bon appétit!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, Mmm!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurm Queen," Farewell! Oh, and congratulations again on winning the contest."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela," Fry, untie us, quick!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, Here I come. [He sees the tub of Slurm.] Let me just-- One more taste.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, You pig. Stop stuffing your craw and save us.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender, I can't see what's happening. Are we boned?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela," Yeah, we're boned."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, I can't stop eating this delicious ooze. But I'm not gonna let you die.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, Hurry!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender, What's happening? [Fry uses his foot to flick the lever up and the machine lifts Leela out of the vat. She runs over to the can machine and stops it. Fry wipes his brow and Bender breathes a sigh of relief.] Just in time!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, [screaming] Nooo! [He sticks his head between the grate and tries to lick up the Slurm.] [talking] I could fit if I didn't have these damn arms!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, We're close to the exit. I can smell those filthy orange guys.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurms, Stop right there!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender, Slurms MacKenzie?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurms, Shh! I want you to take me with you.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, Say what?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurms, I'm partied out. All I want is to stay home and rent videos and watch them with a few friends. Is that so much to ask?
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," Forget it, pal. [He holds up the ""You Win!"" cap.] It says on this bottle-cap you have to party with us."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurms," Alright, when we get to Earth. But please don't invite too many people, I wanna keep it small."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," No can do, Slurms!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurms, This way!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, She's gaining on us.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurms," Go on without me, I'll hold her off."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, But she'll crush you like a worm ... crushing a smaller worm.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurms, It's alright. I'm so tired of partying. So very tired. [He takes his shades off revealing his bloodshot eyes underneath.] I'll save you the only way I know how  By partying! [Dixie turns on Slurms' music and he starts to dance.] Babes.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Dixie," Yes, Mr. MacKenzie?"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurms," You've served me well these 40 years, but this time I've got to party alone."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Trixie, But--
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurms, There'll be other parties for you. Now go. Go!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," Party on, Slurms!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurms," Party on, contest winners. Party on."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Slurm Queen, No! We're ruined! They know our disgusting secret!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Farnsworth," Commissioner, my crew has made a horrific discovery  It seems that Slurm is produced in a colossal worm hiney!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Commissioner," [on screen] Hmm, ""hiney"", you say? Why, with your testimony we'll finally be able to outlaw this insidious Slurm."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry," Outlaw Slurm? [He looks at a can and runs between Farnsworth and the screen.] Uh, don't pay any attention to him, sir..."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, [on screen] Grandpa's making up crazy stories again.
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Farnsworth," [on screen] I'm not your grandpa, you're my uncle! From the year 2000!"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Commissioner," [patronising; on screen] OK, grandpa, we'll take care of the ""bad worms"", don't you worry."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry," Ah, I just wish Slurms MacKenzie were here to enjoy this with me."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," Yeah, that Slurms sure loved to party. Whattya say we all party one last time for him?"
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Leela, For Slurms!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Amy, [simultaneous] For Slurms!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender, [simultaneous] For Slurms!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Farnsworth, [simultaneous] For Slurms!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, [simultaneous] For Slurms!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Zoidberg, [simultaneous] Whammy-wazzle!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Bender," Hey, that's not that bad."
Fry and the Slurm Factory,Fry, Mmm!
Fry and the Slurm Factory,,
I Second that Emotion,Announcer, [voice-over] Futurama is brought to you by ... [The oval zooms back into a corner and is replaced by a monster that has eyes on stalks and large teeth.] ... Glagnar's Human Rinds. It's a buncha muncha cruncha human!
I Second that Emotion,Leela, Aww! Somebody likes snouts.
I Second that Emotion,Fry, Is it me?
I Second that Emotion,Bender," [shouting] Ow, my head! My precious head! [Leela quickly turns the can opener off and Bender edges away from it.] [talking] Stupid can opener. You killed my father and now you've come back for me!"
I Second that Emotion,Fry," You alright, Bender?"
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Yeah, I guess so. But I don't see why we keep this ticking time-bomb around just for that dumb animal."
I Second that Emotion,Leela," Don't yell at Nibbler like that. [She picks him up.] You hurt his feelings. Come on, pet him and make up."
I Second that Emotion,Bender, [turning away] No.
I Second that Emotion,Leela, I said pet him.
I Second that Emotion,Bender, I'll pet him. I'll pet him with both hands! [Nibbler leaps out of Leela's hands and bites Bender's shiny metal ass.] Ow! My ass! Get off!
I Second that Emotion,Leela, Are you alright?
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Ah, it's nothing a lawsuit won't cure."
I Second that Emotion,Leela," Not you. [She picks up Nibbler and looks in his mouth.] Aww, poor baby chipped a fang."
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Hey, I got a busted ass here, I don't see anyone kissing it."
I Second that Emotion,Zoidberg," [reluctant] Alright, I'm coming."
I Second that Emotion,Jeffery," Remember, Rover gets the pill and Pepper gets the suppository. [The woman leaves.] Next."
I Second that Emotion,Jeffery," It's just a simple broken fang, nothing serious."
I Second that Emotion,Bender," What's that you say there, doctor? You're gonna have to put him down?"
I Second that Emotion,Jeffery, No-- What? Huh?
I Second that Emotion,Bender, Terrible shame that. Shall I do the honours?
I Second that Emotion,Leela, No!
I Second that Emotion,Bender, You about done?
I Second that Emotion,Leela, Next time I'm keeping it.
I Second that Emotion,Jeffery," OK, well I believe I have a replacement fang for your pet in the next room. [He walks through a door and doesn't close it. Fry, Leela and Bender step back in horror when they hear an animal growling. Jeffery struggles with the growling creature and glass breaks. He flails his legs around and runs back into the examination room. The door closes. His shirt is ripped and blooded and he has a bruised eye.] The jaguar didn't wanna cooperate but luckily he knocked one of my teeth out. [He chuckles.] Now then."
I Second that Emotion,Fry," Hey, what are these rings in Nibbler's fang?"
I Second that Emotion,Jeffery," Um, I'm still a little woozy from a gazelle kick this morning but if he's anything like the common tree, the rings might indicate his age."
I Second that Emotion,Fry," Yeah, well, good luck. It'd take some kind of genius to count all those rings."
I Second that Emotion,Jeffery, He's five.
I Second that Emotion,Farnsworth," Happy birthday, young Nibbler."
I Second that Emotion,Leela," Aww, look how cuddly he looks in his new cape!"
I Second that Emotion,Bender, [sarcastic] I'd be cuddly too if someone gave me a new cape.
I Second that Emotion,Fry, Who's playing pin the tail on the moon maggot?
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Ooh, me! Everyone watch how good I am. [He closes his eyes and uses his cheating unit to pinpoint the exact place the tail should go. He pins it on, opens his eyes and cheers.] And the crowd goes wild! What prize do I get? Cash?"
I Second that Emotion,Amy," Hey, look at Nibbler!"
I Second that Emotion,Hermes," Aww, he's holding a spoon."
I Second that Emotion,Zoidberg, He's so talented!
I Second that Emotion,Bender," You call that talent? Gather round old Bender and get ready for the show of a lifetime. [He takes off his head, whistles Sweet Georgia Brown and spins his head like a Globetrotter then reattaches it.] Ta-da!"
I Second that Emotion,Hermes, Now he's wearing a hat!
I Second that Emotion,Leela," Come on, let's all sing Happy Birthday!"
I Second that Emotion,All, [singing] What day is today?
I Second that Emotion,"It's Nibbler's birthday,",
I Second that Emotion,"What a day for a birthday,",
I Second that Emotion,Let's all have some cake.,
I Second that Emotion,Fry, [singing] And you smell like one too!
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Hey, what about this?"
I Second that Emotion,Leela," Bender, I thought you were supposed to be cooking for this party."
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler."
I Second that Emotion,Leela," Just make a simple cake. And this time, if someone's going to jump out of it, make sure you put them in after you cook it."
I Second that Emotion,Bender," So it's a cake you want, is it? I'll make you a cake you'll never forget."
I Second that Emotion,Bender," That'll take care of those annoying rats. [He puts it back in the cupboard.] Now, to bake a cake so delicious they'll have no choice but to love and worship me."
I Second that Emotion,Bender, There! This'll teach those filthy bastards who's lovable. Now all I have to do is spell check it and it's ready for my admiring public. [He turns around and washes his hands. While his back is turned Nibbler hops around the worktops and starts sniffing the cake. Bender turns around and sees.] No! Get away from there! [Nibbler gobbles up the cake and Bender screams. Nibbler burps.] That's it.
I Second that Emotion,Bender, Happy birthday!
I Second that Emotion,Leela," Bender, what's going-- [She gasps when she sees Nibbler disappear.] [crying] No!"
I Second that Emotion,Bender, Hey! Can't you see I'm using the toilet?
I Second that Emotion,Amy, Bender! How could you flush Nibbler down the toilet?
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Well, step one, I had to lift the seat. That was the first little annoyance. Am I right, men?"
I Second that Emotion,Leela, [crying] Aren't you upset at all? How would you feel if I flushed Fry down the toilet?
I Second that Emotion,Bender, Only one way to find out.
I Second that Emotion,Leela, [crying] You have no sympathy for anyone else's feelings.
I Second that Emotion,Bender, Of course I do. Right now I feel sorry for you.
I Second that Emotion,Leela, You do?
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Yeah. I mean, one cantaloupe-sized bloodshot eye? You ain't winning no beauty pageants, lady."
I Second that Emotion,Farnsworth," And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I too hope one day to go  The toilet."
I Second that Emotion,Leela, [crying] I wouldn't feel so bad if Bender just understood the pain he caused me.
I Second that Emotion,Calculon," [on TV] Give it to me straight, doctor, don't sugarcoat it."
I Second that Emotion,Doctorbot, [on TV] Very well. Your entire family died when a plane piloted by your fiancée crashed into your uninsured home. And you have inoperable cancer.
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Bet you weren't expecting that one, Calculon!"
I Second that Emotion,Amy, It's like he doesn't understand simple humanoid emotion.
I Second that Emotion,Leela, I wish just once Bender could feel exactly what I feel.
I Second that Emotion,Farnsworth," Actually, through the miracle of science, that can be arranged."
I Second that Emotion,Fry, Uh-oh. Is this gonna be another crazy experiment that crosses a line Man was not meant to cross?
I Second that Emotion,Linda," [on TV] The official death toll in that tragic rocket crash has now been raised to 54,000."
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Hey, what the hell are you doing with my head?"
I Second that Emotion,Farnsworth, I need to tinker in it.
I Second that Emotion,Bender, Why don't you just use a potted plant like Fry?
I Second that Emotion,Farnsworth," Quiet, you. I'm installing an empathy chip."
I Second that Emotion,Fry, And that'll allow Bender to feel other people's emotions?
I Second that Emotion,Farnsworth," Yes. If by ""allow"" you mean ""force""."
I Second that Emotion,Bender, Ooh! Ow! Son of a-- Careful with that! Ow...
I Second that Emotion,Farnsworth," [hammering] Oh, dear. Oh, my. I got it. Once more."
I Second that Emotion,Bender, Ow! Professor!
I Second that Emotion,Farnsworth, [hammering] Steady now.
I Second that Emotion,Bender, Ow!
I Second that Emotion,Farnsworth, There we go. [He takes Bender's head out of the vice and rejoins it to his body.] Now I'll simply tune it to Leela's emotional frequency.
I Second that Emotion,Bender, My God! I'm overcome with ... feelings. I'm experiencing a powerful yearning to ... to cram my gullet full of mackerel heads.
I Second that Emotion,Zoidberg," That's me, baby!"
I Second that Emotion,Farnsworth, Hmm.
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Now I'm worried that I'm not as smart as Leela, but at the same time I feel relieved that I'm cuter than her."
I Second that Emotion,Amy, Uh ... that's me.
I Second that Emotion,Fry, [whispering] Thanks for covering.
I Second that Emotion,Bender, This time I miss Nibbler and I'm feeling nosy and opinionated.
I Second that Emotion,Amy, Bingo!
I Second that Emotion,Hermes, That's Leela!
I Second that Emotion,Leela," Thank you, Professor. I'm happy that Bender can finally feel my pain."
I Second that Emotion,Bender, Happy. I like this feeling. Just don't revert to your usual mopey self.
I Second that Emotion,Leela, I'm not mopey. You shut up!
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Anger, huh? How dare you make me feel anger, you one-eyed jerk with a dead pet!"
I Second that Emotion,Leela," Thanks for taking me out, Amy. I feel slightly less miserable already."
I Second that Emotion,Amy," Hey, you know what'd cheer you up? You should get a puppy."
I Second that Emotion,Leela, A puppy? Nibbler loved to eat puppies.
I Second that Emotion,Fry, What's your problem?
I Second that Emotion,Bender, [crying] I miss Nibbler.
I Second that Emotion,Fry, You do?
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Hell, no! It's Leela's stupid feelings. [He picks up a bottle of Olde Fortran.] Why can't she just drink herself happy like a normal person?"
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Uh-oh, jealousy. [He stands up and points at Fry.] [shouting] You think you're so hot!"
I Second that Emotion,Fry, What?
I Second that Emotion,Bender, The only reason you get all the guys is because you dress like a tramp!
I Second that Emotion,Fry, [crying] They're just responding to my personality.
I Second that Emotion,Amy," Um, Leela? Armando and I are going to the back seat of his car for coffee. You gonna be alright here by yourself?"
I Second that Emotion,Leela, [theatrical happiness] Sure. I'm having a great time -- really. You two go enjoy yourselves.
I Second that Emotion,Bender, [crying] I'm so lonely. I'm gonna go eat a bucket of ice cream. [He walks off.] [crying] A bucket of--
I Second that Emotion,Fry, [shouting] The spoon's in the foot powder.
I Second that Emotion,Bender," I'm at the end of my rope. I can't live another minute without poor, sweet Nibbler."
I Second that Emotion,Fry," Too bad he wasn't an alligator. Y'know, when you flush those things, they stay alive in the sewers."
I Second that Emotion,Bender, Really?
I Second that Emotion,Fry, Yep. My friend's cousin's caseworker saw one once. It's a widely-believed fact.
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Hmm, sewers. [He scratches his chin.] Thinking, thinking, thinking."
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Hang on, Nibbler. Uncle Bender's coming to save you. [He flushes the toilet but doesn't go anywhere.] Damn, it's too small. [He climbs out of it.] What did those human design this for anyway? [He disconnects his left arm, drops it down the toilet and flushes it away.] Aha! Bender, one; toilet, zero! [He spins his head off and flushes it.] See you on the other side!"
I Second that Emotion,Fry, Bender? Bender?
I Second that Emotion,Fry, Have you seen my sombrero?
I Second that Emotion,Leela, Now he's flushed himself down the toilet? Who's he gonna flush next?
I Second that Emotion,Fry," Hey, it's your fault. He only flushed himself because your emotions made him feel bad."
I Second that Emotion,Leela, You're right. I feel terrible.
I Second that Emotion,Fry," Oh, great, now you're making him feel worse!"
I Second that Emotion,Leela, I guess we'd better go down into the sewers and look for him.
I Second that Emotion,Amy, Are you crazy? There's mutants down there! They'll eat you alive.
I Second that Emotion,Zoidberg, They're hideous!
I Second that Emotion,Leela, There's no such thing as mutants. That's a ridiculous urban myth.
I Second that Emotion,Farnsworth," Oh, don't be so sure. Many scientists believe humans really could mutate down there. Uh, due to exposure to toxic waste and radioactive run-off and good old American faeces!"
I Second that Emotion,Fry, God bless America.
I Second that Emotion,Fry," Phew! Uh, ladies first."
I Second that Emotion,Fry," Oh, and the aftertaste!"
I Second that Emotion,Leela, What is it?
I Second that Emotion,Fry, I burned my finger.
I Second that Emotion,Leela," OK, check the guidebook."
I Second that Emotion,Fry," Looks like we're under Park Avenue. Ooh, ritzy! Just think  All this was probably once a charity luncheon for the Met."
I Second that Emotion,Leela," Wait, what's that?"
I Second that Emotion,Bender, I never should have thrown out the manual.
I Second that Emotion,Leela," Bender, you didn't have to come down here."
I Second that Emotion,Bender, I know. But I just missed Nibbler so much.
I Second that Emotion,Leela, [crying] He was so cute.
I Second that Emotion,Bender, [crying] He was so sweet.
I Second that Emotion,Fry, Eck! This emotional display is making me nauseous. [He points the torch at something in the water.] Or maybe it's whatever that is.
I Second that Emotion,Leela, [shouting] Nibbler?
I Second that Emotion,Bender, [shouting] Nibbler?
I Second that Emotion,Leela," It's no use. We'd better turn back. Which way, Fry?"
I Second that Emotion,Fry," Hmm. According to this map, the only way out is through ... that pipe. [He points his torch at an extremely thin pipe. Bender and Leela glare at him.] Don't worry. It gets wider after about a mile."
I Second that Emotion,Leela, [simultaneous] Idiot.
I Second that Emotion,Bender, [simultaneous] Idiot.
I Second that Emotion,Fry," OK, OK, never mind. I'll just ask those people for directions."
I Second that Emotion,Leela, [shouting] Mutants!
I Second that Emotion,Leela, Mutants! They're real!
I Second that Emotion,Fry, I'll take care of this! [He sets the end of the guidebook alight and points it at the mutants.] Back! Back!
I Second that Emotion,Vyolet," Thanks, handsome."
I Second that Emotion,Dwayne," Please, do not be frightened, we're harmless."
I Second that Emotion,Raoul, I have three arms.
I Second that Emotion,Dwayne," I said ""harmless"" not ""armless""."
I Second that Emotion,Vyolet, Lay off him. You know he's only got one ear.
I Second that Emotion,Fry," Hey, aren't you supposed to be eating our brains? You're mutants."
I Second that Emotion,Dwayne, Mutants? Perhaps it is you who are the mutants.
I Second that Emotion,Vyolet," Please, Dwayne, have you looked in a mirror lately?"
I Second that Emotion,Raoul," Welcome to our village. It may not be Paris but it has a certain quaint charm that I, for one, wouldn't trade for the world."
I Second that Emotion,Bender," You guys realise you live in a sewer, right?"
I Second that Emotion,Dwayne, Perhaps. But perhaps your civilisation is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you.
I Second that Emotion,Leela," No, we're on the top."
I Second that Emotion,Fry, Daylight and everything.
I Second that Emotion,Vyolet, It must be wonderful.
I Second that Emotion,Bender, Eh.
I Second that Emotion,Leela," Listen. We actually came down here to find our pet, Nibbler. He got flushed down the toilet."
I Second that Emotion,Raoul," Well if he got flushed down the toilet he probably came through here. Everything always does. Follow me. [He opens an umbrella and Fry, Leela and Bender follow him, covering themselves.] All that is ours was once flushed down your toilets. Over there is our aquarium. [He points at a fish tank with eight fish and a yellow bird floating dead on the top.] This is our library."
I Second that Emotion,Bender, Nothing but crumpled porno and Ayn Rand.
I Second that Emotion,Raoul, And over here is our church.
I Second that Emotion,Fry, Wow. You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb?
I Second that Emotion,Vyolet," Yeah, but nobody's that observant. It's mainly a Christmas and Easter thing."
I Second that Emotion,Leela, [shouting] Nibbler?
I Second that Emotion,Bender," [shouting] Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums."
I Second that Emotion,Fry," So, is it true that alligators flushed down the toilet survive down here?"
I Second that Emotion,Vyolet, No. That's just an urban legend.
I Second that Emotion,Bender, [pointing] Then what are those?
I Second that Emotion,Vyolet, Crocodiles.
I Second that Emotion,Raoul," We keep them as pets. Then, when they grow too large, we flush them down into the sub-sewer."
I Second that Emotion,Dwayne, Some say there's a freakish race of sub-mutants down there.
I Second that Emotion,Vyolet," Please, that's just a sub-urban legend."
I Second that Emotion,Dwayne," Oh? Then I suppose you also don't believe in ... [He snatches Fry's torch and shines it under his chin, emphasising his hideous-ness.] ... El Chupanibre."
I Second that Emotion,Leela, El Chupanibre? What's that?
I Second that Emotion,Dwayne," Gather round, children, for the legend of El Chupanibre."
I Second that Emotion,"(singing) He creeps and crawls in the midnight hush,",
I Second that Emotion,"Silent as a low-flow toilet flush,",
I Second that Emotion,"Watch your step,",
I Second that Emotion,"'Cause sooner or later,",
I Second that Emotion,"He'll eat you whole,",
I Second that Emotion,And half your alligator.,
I Second that Emotion,Vyolet, Crocodile.
I Second that Emotion,Dwayne, Whatever.
I Second that Emotion,Leela, Wait. Our pet Nibbler loves fresh crocodile. It's his favourite treat. He must be El Chupanibre.
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Hey, yeah!"
I Second that Emotion,Raoul, You unleashed the dreaded El Chupanibre upon us? Then you are our sworn enemies.
I Second that Emotion,Leela, You don't understand. He would never hurt people. Let us help you capture him.
I Second that Emotion,Dwayne," Impossible. If the legend is true, our only hope is to offer him a snack-rifice."
I Second that Emotion,Raoul, Yes. An unspoiled virgin.
I Second that Emotion,Leela, [raising her hand] I volunteer.
I Second that Emotion,Vyolet," Nice try, Leela, but we've all seen Zapp Brannigan's webpage."
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Oh, I made myself feel bad."
I Second that Emotion,Raoul," She'll have to do. Chain her to the post! [Dwayne padlocks the chains around Leela. She stands under a shaft of light and faces a long, wide sewer pipe.] And rip her shirt a little. [Dwayne tears it a little and walks away.] Behold. When El Chupanibre comes for the, uh, ""virgin"", he will be snared by this rope trap."
I Second that Emotion,Dwayne, [quietly] Shh. El Chupanibre comes soon. It is nightfall.
I Second that Emotion,Leela, Nightfall? How can you tell down here?
I Second that Emotion,Dwayne, The tide is coming in.
I Second that Emotion,Vyolet, Quiet! The beast approaches.
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Nibbler! Aw, come here, precious! [He picks up Nibbler.] Look, everyone, it's El Chupanibre."
I Second that Emotion,Dwayne, That's not El Chupanibre.
I Second that Emotion,Bender, Say what?
I Second that Emotion,Dwayne, That's El Chupanibre.
I Second that Emotion,Fry, I'll take care of this.
I Second that Emotion,Leela," Bender, do something."
I Second that Emotion,Bender, I'm too scared.
I Second that Emotion,Fry," Leela, your scaredness is being transmitted straight to Bender. If you care about Nibbler, stop caring about him!"
I Second that Emotion,Leela, I can't. I love every living creature.
I Second that Emotion,Fry, Even me?
I Second that Emotion,Leela, As a friend.
I Second that Emotion,Fry, Damn.
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Listen to me, Leela  I'm an expert at not caring. The secret is to stop giving a rat's ass about anyone else and start thinking of the things that you want, that you deserve, that the world owes you."
I Second that Emotion,Leela," Well, I could use a new tank top."
I Second that Emotion,Bender, Bigger! Bigger!
I Second that Emotion,Leela, A fashionable tank top. And designer boots ... encrusted with jewels.
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Don't stop now, you'll need some pants to go with that outfit."
I Second that Emotion,Leela, Yeah. And I could afford it all if I didn't have to feed that stupid Nibbler.
I Second that Emotion,Bender," Bender is back. I'll save you, Nibbler."
I Second that Emotion,Fry, Bender's gonna be killed!
I Second that Emotion,Leela, You know what else I could use? A weekend at one of those fancy spas. And a Toblerone.
I Second that Emotion,Fry, [cheering] Yeah!
I Second that Emotion,Leela, You did it!
I Second that Emotion,Raoul, Let's have a tissue-tape parade!
I Second that Emotion,Bender," No, thanks!"
I Second that Emotion,Dwayne," Gather round, children, to hear the legend of Bender."
I Second that Emotion,[He strums the guitar.],
I Second that Emotion,(singing) He came from above with a--,
I Second that Emotion,[A string snaps and he sighs.],
I Second that Emotion,(talking) It's gonna be many a year before someone flushes another guitar string.,
I Second that Emotion,Farnsworth, That was a disgusting story.
I Second that Emotion,Leela," And it's all thanks to Bender. I love you, Bender."
I Second that Emotion,Bender, I love you too. [He turns to Farnsworth.] Get that stupid chip out of me before I kill myself!
I Second that Emotion,Farnsworth," Bender, you won't believe this, but the empathy chip burned out. The emotion you felt for Nibbler was actually your own."
I Second that Emotion,Fry, Looks like Bender learned an important lesson about respecting other people's feelings afterall.
I Second that Emotion,Farnsworth," No, I'm wrong. The empathy chip was running at triple capacity."
I Second that Emotion,Bender," And I still barely felt anything. Goodnight, losers!"
I Second that Emotion,Leela," You know, Bender may not have learned anything from me, but I think I actually learned something from him. [She stands up and heads for the door.] [shouting] So long, jerkwads!"
I Second that Emotion,Farnsworth, [waving] So long!
I Second that Emotion,,
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry," Hmm. Horsey to pointy guy six. [His knight charges at the bishop and the bishop batters it to the ground with his crook. The horse pulls out a dagger, stabs the bishop and kicks him off the game board. Fry chuckles and reclines in his seat.] Check."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender," Hmm. Get him, boys!"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, [hoarse] Good move.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. [Hermes walks in behind him carrying a package.] We have a mission to further the noble cause of intergalactic peace."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender, Nope. Watching cartoons.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, Sorry.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, What's the mission?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Farnsworth, It's a delivery for the Democratic Order Of Planets.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, DOOP? What's that?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Farnsworth," It's similar to the United Nations from your time, Fry."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, Uh...
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Hermes, Or like the Federation from your Star Trek programme.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, [getting it] Oh!
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Farnsworth, Tonight is the ribbon-cutting for the DOOP's new headquarters.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, What are we delivering?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Farnsworth, Something without which no ribbon-cutting ceremony could proceed. The ceremonial oversized scissors.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, We'll get them there as quickly as we can.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Farnsworth," Alright, but don't run with them."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry," Wow! There's a million aliens. I've never seen anything so mind-blowing. Ooh, a reception table with muffins!"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Glab," Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the DOOP's magnificent new headquarters. A fitting home for an organisation that has fostered peace throughout the universe. Even between the Insectoids and the Space Lizards."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry," So, what's it like on planet Amazonia?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Amazonian, Big rats there. Me crush with club.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, That's so interesting. Maybe we could get to know each other over a coffee.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Glab," I can think of no better place for this centre of diplomacy than here in orbit around the Neutral Planet. [She turns to the grey man.] What are your thoughts on this momentous occasion, Your Neutralness?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Neutral President, I have no strong feelings one way or the other.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," I hate these filthy Neutrals, Kif. With enemies you know where they stand but with Neutrals, who knows? It sickens me. [Kif sighs. Fry, Leela and Bender walk past with the scissors and Zapp stops them.] Halt. [They gasp.] Why, Leela, I do believe we've met."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender, [whispering] He means you guys did it.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela," If you don't mind, we're here to deliver the scissors for the ribbon-cutting."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, Then you're under arrest.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, What for?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, How do I know these scissors aren't part of some Neutral plot?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, But they're not even sharp. Who could I possibly hurt with them?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," The Yarn People of Nylar 4? [He points at the pink creatures made of yarn.] So, a plan to assassinate a weird-looking alien with scissors. How very Neutral of you."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, What?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," It was almost the perfect crime, but you forgot one thing  Rock crushes scissors ... but paper covers rock ... and scissors cut paper. Kif, we have a conundrum. [Kif sighs.] Search them for paper, and bring me a rock."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Kif, Why?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," So beautiful, yet so neutral. [He grabs her arms and handcuffs them behind her back.] Drag them to the ship."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Glab," And now, to cut the ribbon, the legendary DOOP captain who just returned from a triumphant carpet-bombing of Eden 7, Zapp Brannigan."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, What makes a man turn neutral? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Kif," Um, sir, you're supposed to be cutting the ribbon right now."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, No matter. I'll simply cut it from here with the ship's laser.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Kif," Sir, I don't think that's wise."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Kif, if there's one thing I don't need it's your I-don't-think-that's-wise attitude."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, Whoopsie-daisy!
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Glab," Zapp Brannigan, you stand accused of blowing up DOOP headquarters. How do you plead?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, Absolutely 99% not guilty.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Glab, Then the prosecutor will call his first witness.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour, I'm just a simple Hyper-Chicken from a backwoods asteroid but if it please the court I reckon I'll call the entire jury."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Glab, I'm going to allow this.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Hyper-Chicken, Members of the jury ... [He pecks the floor.] ... did y'all happen to catch a gander at who blew up that there DOOP headquarters?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Juror #1," [simultaneous] That's the guy, right there."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Juror #2," [simultaneous] Oh, yeah, right there."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Small Glurmo #1, [simultaneous] That one.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Hyper-Chicken, And are y'all gonna vote to convict him?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Neptunian, [simultaneous] You'd better believe it.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Juror #1, [simultaneous] You bet.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Glab, The jury is instructed to disregard its own testimony.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour, the prosecution rests."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Glab," The evidence against Zapp Brannigan is strong. However, in light of his years of service, and the incompetence of this hillbilly prosecutor, I'm afraid I must dismiss all charges."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela," Dismiss all charges? Your Honour, I know the case is closed and you've rendered your verdict, but I wanna testify."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Glab, I'm going to allow this.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Hyper-Chicken," Now, Miss Leela, on the date in question, were you or were you not wearing a hoop skirt?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela," That's a stupid question. What matters is Zapp Brannigan is the sorriest captain I've ever seen, and I saw the idiot blow up DOOP headquarters with my own eye."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, I'd like to cross-examine the witness.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Glab, I'm going to allow this.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, We've met before have we not?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, [reluctantly] Yes.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," And on that occasion, did you have sex with someone? May I remind you you are still under oath."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, [reluctantly] Yes.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, Please point out the person in this courtroom you had sex with. [Leela points at him and Fry hoots.] And his name is?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, Zapp Brannigan.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, The very same Zapp Brannigan who did not blow up DOOP headquarters. I rest my case.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Glab," Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you may begin your deliberations."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Small Glurmo #1," Your Honour, we have reached a verdict. We find the defendant ... guilty."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Glab," Zapp Brannigan, you are hereby stripped of your rank as captain and dismissed from the DOOP."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," I'd like to make one final statement. Kif, c'mere and hold up the flag. [Kif scurries past him and holds up the DOOP flag behind him.] And wave it a little, for God's sakes. My friends, you can take away a man's title and his uniform but you can never take away his integrity or his honour. Plus it was mostly Kif's fault."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Kif, What?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Glab," Kif Kroker, you are also stripped of your rank and dishonourably discharged."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," One day a man has everything, the next day he blows up a $400 billion space station and the next day he has nothing. It makes you think."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Kif," No, it doesn't."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Come, Kif, it's time to begin our life as civilians. [He walks off and Kif doesn't follow.] That's an order, soldier."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry," Hey, Bender?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender, Yeah?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela," Alright, this is the third hose fight I've broken up today and the second one using actual hoses. Now move your lazy asses and start scrubbing the ship like I ordered you to."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry," You don't have to get so mad, Leela."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender," Yeah, Fry already wiped off some of the dirt with his finger."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, Zapp?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Leela, I didn't know where else to turn. You're the only woman who ever loved me."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, I never loved you.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, I mean physically.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, What do you want?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Just let me work for a little food. Perhaps I could paint a fence, or service you sexually, or mop the floors."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, You don't know how to do any of those things.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, Kif might.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Farnsworth," Leela, who are you talking to?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, Just a broken-down hobo who's hit rock-bottom. And his commanding officer.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Farnsworth," Why, you're that disgraced starship captain. [He turns to Leela.] Having him on staff will distract people from our horrendous safety record. [He turns back to Zapp and Kif.] Come in."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Farnsworth, I'd like everyone to meet our new employees. [He leans over to Hermes.] [whispering] Which ones are new?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Hermes, The green dude and the fat man.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Farnsworth," Hmm, I could swear I've never seen that robot before either."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender, I'm Bender. You know? The lovable rascal.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Farnsworth," Oh, yes, yes. My good friend, of course. [He turns to Hermes and shrugs.] Anyway, whoever you all are, I have good news. You'll be making a delivery to Stumbos 4, a planet with such high gravity you'll most likely be crushed under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy!"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," So, this Leela. I know she's a very sensuous woman but what manner of captain is she?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, She's really strict.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender, And mean.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, I see. Does she by any chance give the crewmembers spankings?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry," No, she just makes us do work and stuff."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Good, good. But should she ever institute some sort of bare-bottom spanking policy, let me go in your place. I won't have my comrades harmed."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender," Hey, this guy's alright!"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Here's to us poor schmoes working for the man. Even if he is a hot, sexy, female man."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Kif," I've computed out landing co-ordinates, Captain."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela," Thanks, Kif. Very nice work."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Kif," Wait, what?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela," I said ""very nice work""."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Kif, This is the happiest day of my life.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela," OK, crew, listen up. Your job is to delivery these 40 pillows to that hotel."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender, They're not very heavy but you don't hear me not complaining.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, They're not heavy in here because we have an anti-grav pump. But once you get out on the surface the gravity will be very intense.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry," Hey, no prob', this lead apron'll protect me."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, I don't want any screw-ups. Use the hover-dolly and just deliver one pillow at a time.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender," Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all the pillows at once."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, Yeah!
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, That's using the old noodle!
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Come on, girdle. Hold!"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender, Uh-oh.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, What the hell happened?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender," Some breaking occurred, the dolly was involved, that's about all we know."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, I told you dumb apes not to overload it. Each of those pillows weighs 150lbs here.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry," Alright, don't get your panties in a knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender, I'll start loading up the pillows.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela," No way, Jack. You disobeyed an order, so now you have to deliver all 40 pillows by hand."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Let me ask you a serious question, Leela  Does the company that made your bra make a girdle as well? I ask because a friend of mine..."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, Just get to work.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender," [mocking] I'm Leela, get to work, neh, neh, neh."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, I agree.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Kif," The point is, it's just so humiliating working for that man. Once, he actually ordered me to ... shave his armpits while he was in the bathtub. So, I said--"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela," Y'know, why don't we talk about something besides Zapp for a while?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Kif," Oh, alright. Um ... well ... how 'bout then, um... OK, well, there he was in the tub, alright?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry," Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender, This is all Leela's fault.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry," Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up dolly, we could have broken it, given up and gone home by now."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Y'know, boys, a good captain needs many skills, such as boldness, daring and a velour uniform. And I'm not convinced Leela has any of those things."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry," Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish she didn't make us work so much."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Back when I was captain all I asked from my men was their complete loyalty. If I had that, then for all I cared they could sit around the whole day drinking beer in their underpants."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender, Beer?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, Underpants?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Kif," But now, Zapp's not captain anymore. I'm free! [He laughs.] Oh, you hear that? I'm actually laughing!"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, This is a mutiny.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender," You're outta here, lady. Zapp's the new captain."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, All hail the new captain.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Leela, you might be a formidable do-er of the nasty but I am forced to relieve you of your post."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela," On what grounds, you slobbering oaf?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, Failure to prevent a mutiny. Throw her in the brig.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, We don't have a brig.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as ""the brig""."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, You really don't want me to be captain anymore?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender," You got it, genius."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela," But, didn't I do a good job?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, You were mean and you yelled and you made us do all that work.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela," Sometimes a captain needs to do those things. Besides I, I thought we were friends."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry," Yeah, well, you shouldn't have been such a mean captain then."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender," Don't worry, Leela. Soon we'll be able to look back on this and laugh."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Back in my old uniform, and it nearly still fits. Even after all that fattening hobo cuisine."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Kif," What shall I do with your civilian clothes, sir?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Take them to the laundry-brig. [Kif leaves. Zapp turns to Fry and Bender.] So, do I have your loyalty, men?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender, [saluting] To the ends of the universe.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, Ten hundred percent!
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, That's not nearly loyal enough. I order you to sit around and drink beer until you're as loyal as Kif here.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender," Yes, sir, sir!"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Kif," Um, may I have a beer, sir?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," No. You're loyal enough already. Meanwhile, I have a plan. We will single-handedly attack our archenemy the Neutral Planet."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Kif," Oh, jeez."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Once the neutral war machine lies in ruins, I'll be a hero again and the DOOP will reinstate me as captain."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Kif," But, sir, that plan makes no sense."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Maybe not to you, Kif, but if I recall correctly, you were court-martialled in disgrace."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry," Ooh, burn!"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender," Nailed you, buddy!"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, Prepare to continue the epic struggle between good and neutral.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry," This is awesome! We're gonna be like pow-pow-pow, and they're gonna be like ... [He screams and makes explosion noises.] ... and then we'll have pancakes to celebrate and I'll be like..."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Precisely. Now, in the name of all that is good and honourable, we'll call the Neutral President with a message of peace, then blast him."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender," [saluting] Yes, sir, sirdy-sir-sir-sir!"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, Fly the white flag of war.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp, [on screen] This is Zapp Brannigan of the good ship ... Planet Express Ship. I come swinging the olive branch of peace.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Neutral President's Aide," Should we trust him, Your Neutralness?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Neutral President, All I know is my gut says maybe.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender," What now, chief?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Now we crash the ship into their headquarters, killing them in a hellish firestorm from which no living thing can escape."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry," Good, good, then what?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Then your mission is complete. I, meanwhile, will have ejected to safety, wearing the only spacesuit on board."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, Wait a second. Is this plan gonna kill us?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Of course. What do you think I meant by ""loyalty""? Now help me into the only spacesuit. It looks a bit sweaty in there so you may need to apply baby powder."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry," Leela, we want you to be captain again."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, Let me guess. He cancelled naptime? [They shake their heads and she puts the folded sheet on top of a pile.] He ran out of beer? [They shake their heads again.] So he's about to kill us?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, We want Leela to be captain again.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," So it's mutiny, is it? I never thought I'd see the day. Come, Kif, let's eject. I found a children's spacesuit you can wear."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Kif," To be honest, sir, I'd rather stay here with Captain Leela. She actually listens to what I have to--"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela," Oh, no! He's disabled the steering. [The look ahead as they get closer to the planet.] We're gonna crash!"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender," Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess ... and my banjo. [Fry smiles weakly.] And Fry."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela," OK, OK. We have one chance. Are you willing to do what I say as captain?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, Absolutely.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, Even if I make you work hard?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender, As your God is my witness.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't break and load all the dark matter into the left engine.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender," Oh, man, that crap's heavy."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, And warm.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, Just do it.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Neutral President's Aide," Your Neutralness, it's a beige alert."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Neutral President," If I don't survive, tell my wife, ""Hello""."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, Hurry! I don't wanna die at the age of 25.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender," [on screen] Honey, unless we hit a time warp, I wouldn't worry about it."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, It's too low.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender, Quick.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, You did it! You actually did it!
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, And no one will have to punish anyone for the mutiny.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," And so, when Captain Leela panicked, perhaps distracted by female troubles, my quick thinking allowed me to do whatever I did to save the day."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Glab," Captain Leela, is this rambling story of magic and heroism true?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela," Well, actually--"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Farnsworth, [whispering] That a girl! If they don't take him back we can keep him as captain.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela," Your Honour, it's all true  My female incompetence, Zapp's cat-like reflexes, the stuff that made no sense, all of it."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Glab," In that case, Zapp Brannigan, I hereby restore your rank and parking privileges."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Farnsworth," Oh, foo!"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Zapp," Come, Kif, we've got work to do."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Kif, I-I'll call and tell you about it.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry," Leela, I just want you to know that even though you're mean, you're the best captain ever."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender," Yeah, you're one dynamite lady. Can we have a week off?"
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, No.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry, Please?
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Bender," Come on, Captain."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela," Oh, alright."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Farnsworth, No time off.
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Fry," Aw, man."
"Brannigan, Begin Again",Leela, Let's mutiny!
"Brannigan, Begin Again",,
A Head in the Polls,Narrator," [voice-over; on TV] You're entering the vicinity of an area adjacent to a location. [A stopwatch and telephone fly past.] The kind of place where there might be a monster or some kind of weird mirror. [An old boot, a man shampooing his hair and a half-eaten drumstick fly past.] These are just examples. It could also be something much better. [A door rotates towards the camera in the centre of the picture.] Prepare to enter The Scary Door. [The door opens onto the titles, which shatter like glass. The show begins and the first scene is a pan over a post-apocalyptic wasteland. The camera glides past smoking rubble.] As per your request, please find enclosed the last man on earth."
A Head in the Polls,Man," [on TV] Finally, solitude. I can read books for all eternity. [His glasses break.] It's not fair! It's not fair! Wait, my eyes aren't that bad. I can still read the large print books. [His eyes fall out and he screams.] It's not f-- Well, lucky I know how to read Braille! [His hands fall off and he screams. Then his tongue falls out and finally his head comes off.] Hey, look at that weird mirror!"
A Head in the Polls,Bender, Cursed by his own hubris!
A Head in the Polls,Leela," There's a political debate on! Quick, change the channel!"
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Hey, that's what Fry said when we turned on the debate!"
A Head in the Polls,Announcer, [voice-over; on TV] C-SPAN9 presents  The Thrill Of Politics.
A Head in the Polls,Leela," Look, I know there are no car chases but this is important. One of these two men will become president of the world."
A Head in the Polls,Fry, What do we care? We live in the United States.
A Head in the Polls,Leela, The United States is part of the world.
A Head in the Polls,Fry, Wow! I have been gone a long time.
A Head in the Polls,Johnson," [on TV] It's time someone had the courage to stand up and say  ""I'm against those things that everybody hates""."
A Head in the Polls,Jackson," [on TV] Now I respect my opponent. I think he's a good man but, quite frankly, I agree with everything he just said!"
A Head in the Polls,Fry, These are the candidates? They sound like clones. [He looks a little harder.] Wait a minute. They are clones!
A Head in the Polls,Leela, Don't let their identical DNA fool you. They differ on some key issues.
A Head in the Polls,Johnson, [on TV] I say your three cent titanium tax goes too far.
A Head in the Polls,Jackson, [on TV] And I say your three cent titanium tax doesn't go too far enough!
A Head in the Polls,Fry," If I were registered to vote, I'd send these clowns a message by staying home on election day and dressing up like a clown."
A Head in the Polls,Leela, You're not registered?
A Head in the Polls,Fry," Nope. Not vaccinated either! Besides, it's not like one vote ever made a difference."
A Head in the Polls,Leela, That's not true; the first robot president won by exactly one vote.
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Ah, yes, John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a cord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree."
A Head in the Polls,Farnsworth," But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver."
A Head in the Polls,Leela," The point is, one vote can make a difference and even though it won't, I'm still taking you to get registered."
A Head in the Polls,Farnsworth," Yes, that's a capital idea. Let's all go register!"
A Head in the Polls,Fry," Professor, when did you become so obsessed with voting?"
A Head in the Polls,Farnsworth, The very instant I became old.
A Head in the Polls,Farnsworth, The problem with both parties is that they always want to give your tax dollars to the less fortunate.
A Head in the Polls,Fry, The less fortunate get all the breaks!
A Head in the Polls,Zoidberg," You know, Fry, you could join a third party, maybe."
A Head in the Polls,Amy, Only weirdos and mutants join third parties.
A Head in the Polls,Zoidberg, Really? I'd better keep an eye out at the next meeting.
A Head in the Polls,Fry," What party do you belong to, Bender?"
A Head in the Polls,Bender, I'm not allowed to vote.
A Head in the Polls,Fry, 'Cause you're a robot?
A Head in the Polls,Bender," No, convicted felon."
A Head in the Polls,Woman, We favour unreasonably huge subsidies to the Brain Slug Planet.
A Head in the Polls,Fry," OK, but what are the Brain Slugs who control you gonna do for the working man?"
A Head in the Polls,Woman, Attach Brain Slugs to them.
A Head in the Polls,Fry," [sarcastic] Sure, you say that now!"
A Head in the Polls,Amy," So, is it true you can make all kinds of shirts and ropes out of hemp?"
A Head in the Polls,Stoned Guy," Dave's not here, man."
A Head in the Polls,Amy, I also heard hemp makes great shampoo.
A Head in the Polls,Stoned Guy, It does? No way! I gotta check out this brochure!
A Head in the Polls,Farnsworth, So what are you doing to protect my constitutional right to bear doomsday devices?
A Head in the Polls,N.R.A. Man," Well, first off, we're gonna get rid of that three-day waiting period for mad scientists."
A Head in the Polls,Farnsworth," Damn straight! Today, the mad scientist can't get a doomsday device, tomorrow it's the mad grad student. Where will it end?"
A Head in the Polls,N.R.A. Man," Amen, brother. I don't go anywhere without my mutated anthrax ... [He takes a vial of the stuff out of his pocket.] ... for duck hunting."
A Head in the Polls,Zoidberg," Sure, humans are cute, but how else are we supposed to test cosmetics?"
A Head in the Polls,Hermes, I concur.
A Head in the Polls,Fry, Now here's a party I can get excited about. Sign me up!
A Head in the Polls,V.A.P. Man," Sorry, not with that attitude."
A Head in the Polls,Fry," [downbeat] OK then, screw it."
A Head in the Polls,V.A.P. Man," Welcome aboard, brother!"
A Head in the Polls,Fry, [excited] Alright!
A Head in the Polls,V.A.P. Man, You're out.
A Head in the Polls,Fry, That was pretty cool. I think I'm actually starting to get interested in politics.
A Head in the Polls,Linda," [on TV] And so, with two weeks left in the campaign, the question on everyone's mind is who will be the next President of Earth? Jack Johnson or bitter rival John Jackson? Two terrific candidates, huh, Morbo?"
A Head in the Polls,Morbo, [on TV] All humans are vermin in the eyes of Morbo.
A Head in the Polls,Linda," [on TV] In other local news, disaster struck on Saturn's moon of Titan today, when a titanium mine collapsed, trapping 1,000 robot workers."
A Head in the Polls,Bender, What? Lord have mercy!
A Head in the Polls,Linda," [on TV] Unless something is done quickly, the trapped robots will be dead within 300 years. [She turns to a screen where a mine spokesman is stood outside the collapsed mine. Trapped robots wave their arms behind him.] Sir, what rescue operations are planned?"
A Head in the Polls,Mine Spokesman, [on TV] The plan is basically to pave over the area and get on with our lives.
A Head in the Polls,Morbo, [on TV] News of the mines closing sent titanium prices skyrocketing.
A Head in the Polls,Bender, Alright! I'm rich!
A Head in the Polls,Leela, What are you talking about?
A Head in the Polls,Bender, My body's 40% titanium! [He bangs his chest cabinet.] I'm finally richer than those snooty ATM machines.
A Head in the Polls,Fry, Too bad you can't spend it.
A Head in the Polls,Bender," [ironic] Oh, can't I?"
A Head in the Polls,Fry, No.
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Watch me, poor man."
A Head in the Polls,Pawnbroker, [from inside] Pleasure doing business with you.
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Game's over, losers. I have all the money! Compare your lives to mine and then kill yourselves! [A dog sniffs his head.] Hey, get away. Shoo! I'll give you five dollars to not do what you're thinking about doing. [The dog cocks it's leg and Bender chuckles.] You just lost five dollars!"
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Hey, buddy. Little help? [The man kicks Bender into the air.] [shouting] Thank you!"
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Hello, peasants."
A Head in the Polls,Leela, Bender? What happened to you?
A Head in the Polls,Fry," Yeah, you look different. Did you get a haircut?"
A Head in the Polls,Bender," No, I sold my body."
A Head in the Polls,Farnsworth," Sold your body? Oh, Bender, I've been down that road. I know it's glamorous and the parties are great but you'll end up spending every dollar you make on jewellery and skintight pants."
A Head in the Polls,Fry," This is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna live without a body?"
A Head in the Polls,Bender, Pft! Bodies are for hookers and fat people! All I need is a wad of cash with a head wrapped around it.
A Head in the Polls,Fry," Well, at least now you can pay off your loan shark."
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Yeah, right. What's he gonna do, break my legs?"
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Ah, this is the life. Another martini, please."
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Shaken, not stirred. [The man shakes his head.] Aw, yeah!"
A Head in the Polls,Bender, Put it all on black.
A Head in the Polls,Croupier, 21 red. [Bender moves so his antenna points to another number.] I beg your pardon. 33 black.
A Head in the Polls,Bender, Yes! The rich get richer!
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Strike! In your face, Leela! [He laughs. Leela rolls her ball and it hits Bender.] Ow!"
A Head in the Polls,Bender, [shouting] Timber!
A Head in the Polls,Fry," Hey, Bender, can I take a ride in your car?"
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Maybe if you clean up first. It looks like your neck stepped in something. Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body!"
A Head in the Polls,Fry, Hey! You look me in the shins and say that.
A Head in the Polls,Bender," I've had it up to here with this place. I'm off to the Head Museum to hang out with classy heads like me who appreciate the finer things  poetry, philosophy, hats. So long, coffin stuffers! [He revs the engine but the car careens out of control. Bender's head falls out and the car crashes into a plant pot.] Uh, could one of you coffin stuffers please carry me?"
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Now, which group of heads is good enough for me to hang out with? What do you think, Fry? Fry?"
A Head in the Polls,Schiffer," Hi, I'm Claudia Schiffer's head."
A Head in the Polls,Fry, I recognise you. Didn't you use to have a body of some sort?
A Head in the Polls,Schiffer," Yeah, but it was holding me back. You know, I just did the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimcap Issue."
A Head in the Polls,Fry," Well, you're looking great."
A Head in the Polls,Schiffer, Thanks. I wouldn't mind losing a few pounds though.
A Head in the Polls,Fry, [shrugging] Couldn't hurt.
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Ah, US presidents. [Leela sets his head down next to George Washington.] Sturdy shelves, good security. [Two bodyguard heads look at him.] This place has class."
A Head in the Polls,Clinton," [to Leela] Hey, sugar cookie. You know, legally, nothing I can do counts as sex anymore."
A Head in the Polls,Ford," I apologise for his rudeness, ma'am. He gets this way around meaty-looking women."
A Head in the Polls,Fry," [to Clinton] Hey, I remember you. I was gonna vote for you one time. But voting isn't cool so I stayed home alone and got trashed on Listerine."
A Head in the Polls,Ford," Frankly, I've never felt voting to be all that essential to the process."
A Head in the Polls,Nixon," No kidding, Ford."
A Head in the Polls,Bender," So then the hookerbot says, ""That's not my expansion slot"" and my friend says, ""That's not my gold-plated 25-pin connector!"""
A Head in the Polls,Washington," Oh, Bender. Thou robots really cracketh me up."
A Head in the Polls,Bender," You know, I like it here. What's the rent on one of these jars?"
A Head in the Polls,George H.W. Bush," Sorry, Bender, but we just can't allow every Tom, Dick, and Harry to move in. No offence, Jefferson, Nixon and Truman."
A Head in the Polls,Carter, Maybe Mr. Bender can get a spot in the closet of presidential losers.
A Head in the Polls,Dole," Bob Dole needs company. LaRouche won't stop with the ""knock knock"" jokes."
A Head in the Polls,Bender, Pass.
A Head in the Polls,Washington," So, telleth, Bender. What hath happened to your body?"
A Head in the Polls,Bender, I hocked it.
A Head in the Polls,Washington, Hocked it? Why wouldst thou do that?
A Head in the Polls,Bender, Same reason you hocked your teeth.
A Head in the Polls,Washington, Ah. Booze money.
A Head in the Polls,Nixon," I remember my body; flabby, pastey-skinned, riddled with phlebitis. A good Republican body! God, I loved it."
A Head in the Polls,Fry," I hear that. I spent most of my teen years loving my body. Course, it was tough love but-- Ooh!"
A Head in the Polls,Leela," Fry, he opened up relations with China. He doesn't want to hear about your ding-dong."
A Head in the Polls,Bender," So, Nixon. Even if you miss your body, being a head's great too, right?"
A Head in the Polls,Nixon," No, son. It's a sad and lonely life."
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Oh, great. Now you tell me!"
A Head in the Polls,Nixon, That's my style. I like to kick 'em when they're down!
A Head in the Polls,Bender," [sleep-talking] Ones ... zeros ... one, one, zero, zero, one--"
A Head in the Polls,Fry," Bender, what is it?"
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Whoa, what an awful dream. Ones and zeros everywhere. And I thought I saw a two."
A Head in the Polls,Fry," It was just a dream, Bender. There's no such thing as two."
A Head in the Polls,Bender," I know what this is about. My body loved me, and I turned it's back on it. Well, old friend, tie a yellow ribbon round your neck, 'cause I'm a-comin' home!"
A Head in the Polls,Bender, You sold my body? To who?
A Head in the Polls,Pawnbroker," I can't reveal that information, but you look like a nice robot. Tell you what, I'll give you 50 bucks for the kid."
A Head in the Polls,Fry," Hey, my clothes are worth 50 bucks!"
A Head in the Polls,Pawnbroker, Deal.
A Head in the Polls,Bender, [crying] Oh! How could I let this happen? I can't go through the rest of my life like this.
A Head in the Polls,Farnsworth, Don't you have a self-destruct button?
A Head in the Polls,Bender," [crying] Yeah, but it's on my body. What am I gonna do?"
A Head in the Polls,Fry," Ah, I can't stand to see a robot cry. Let's watch TV!"
A Head in the Polls,Nixon," [on TV] And so, ladies and gentlemen, I'm throwing my head into the ring. I'm announcing my candidacy for the presidency of Earth."
A Head in the Polls,Journalist #1, Just one question.
A Head in the Polls,Scoop Chang," Scoop Chang, Beijing Bugle. Sir, the constitution clearly states that nobody can be elected president more than twice."
A Head in the Polls,Nixon," That's right. Nobody. [He steps out from behind his podium.] But as you can plainly see, I've got a shiny new body!"
A Head in the Polls,Bender, Oh!
A Head in the Polls,Leela," Bender, he's got your body!"
A Head in the Polls,Bender," That dirty, double-crossing bastard! How dare he run off with Richard Nixon!"
A Head in the Polls,Leela, Nixon must have bought your body from the pawn shop.
A Head in the Polls,Fry," Yeah, and that electric guitar."
A Head in the Polls,Nixon," [singing; on TV] Remember what the dormouse said,"
A Head in the Polls,Feed your head.,
A Head in the Polls,"(talking) I'm meeting you half way, you stupid hippies! [Cheers from the crowd.] I am not a crook's head!",
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Yeah, you are, you stole my body! Fry, Leela, you gotta help me!"
A Head in the Polls,Leela," Ordinarily I'd say no and lecture you on how this is your own fault for being such an idiot. But when a robotic Nixon is on the loose, we have a duty to take action. Idiot."
A Head in the Polls,Morbo," Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates  Puny Human #1, Puny Human #2, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon."
A Head in the Polls,Nixon," Hello, Morbo. How's the family?"
A Head in the Polls,Morbo, Belligerent and numerous.
A Head in the Polls,Nixon, Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Great. First he steals my body, now he's touching my stuff."
A Head in the Polls,Leela, Come on. We've gotta find some way to talk to him.
A Head in the Polls,Morbo, Morbo demands an answer to the following question  If you saw delicious candy in the hands of a small child would you seize and consume it?
A Head in the Polls,Johnson, Unthinkable.
A Head in the Polls,Jackson, I wouldn't think of it.
A Head in the Polls,Morbo," What about you, Mr. Nixon? I remind you, you are under a truth-o-scope."
A Head in the Polls,Nixon," Uh, well, I, uh ... the question is-is vague. You don't say what kind of candy, whether anyone is watching or, uh... [He clears his throat.] At any rate, I certainly wouldn't harm the child."
A Head in the Polls,Nixon's campaign manager," You scored big points tonight, sir."
A Head in the Polls,Nixon, What are you talking about? They ate me alive out there.
A Head in the Polls,Nixon's campaign manager," Yes, but your body stayed on message. And that message is, ""Look at my shiny new body"". The robots ate it up. You've got real charisma from the neck down."
A Head in the Polls,Nixon," Nixon with charisma? My God, I can rule the universe!"
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Give me my body back, you two-bit thief!"
A Head in the Polls,Nixon," Now, look here, you drugged-out Communist. I paid for this body and I'd no sooner return it than I would my little cocker spaniel dog, Checkers. [The dog's head in a jar barks.] Shut up, damnit!"
A Head in the Polls,Fry," Please, Mr. Nixon. We're appealing to your sense of decency."
A Head in the Polls,Bender, That was a good one!
A Head in the Polls,Nixon," Seriously though, I'm never giving back this body. Now beat it! Before I get Cambodian on your asses!"
A Head in the Polls,Bender, [crying] It's hopeless. We might as well turn in my head for the five cent deposit.
A Head in the Polls,Fry," No way! I'm not letting my best friend get recycled. Not for five cents, not for five hundred cents! Leela, I've got a plan!"
A Head in the Polls,Leela, I've got a better plan.
A Head in the Polls,Fry, [whispering] Why would Nixon stay at the Watergate?
A Head in the Polls,Leela, [whispering] They give you a discount if you've been here before.
A Head in the Polls,Fry," Keep going, we're right behind you."
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Whoa, mama! Get a room, you two!"
A Head in the Polls,Man, [from inside] We're in a room!
A Head in the Polls,Bender, Well then lose some weight.
A Head in the Polls,Nixon, [sleep-talking] Aroo!
A Head in the Polls,Nixon," [sleep-talking] Oh, yeah. You women's libbers really know how to party!"
A Head in the Polls,Bender, [whispering] Psst! There I am!
A Head in the Polls,Nixon," [sleep-talking] Hey, Betty Friedan, send a little of that lotion my way!"
A Head in the Polls,Leela," OK, almost got it. Steady. Steady. Don't panic."
A Head in the Polls,Fry," Ooh! [Below, some more writing says ""Thought Activated"".] Uh-oh!"
A Head in the Polls,Nixon, What the-- [Fry smiles weakly at Leela.] You shaggy peaceniks have some nerve!
A Head in the Polls,Bender, I'm just here for what's mine. Don't make me kick your neck.
A Head in the Polls,Nixon," Bring it on, soup can."
A Head in the Polls,Leela," Alright, break it up, you two!"
A Head in the Polls,Nixon," That's it. You're all going to jail. And don't expect me to grant a pardon like that sissy, Ford."
A Head in the Polls,Leela, You'll never pardon anybody because you'll never get elected president. The voters of Earth aren't the pea-brained idiots they were back in your time.
A Head in the Polls,Nixon," Oh, no? Well, listen here, missy. Computers may be twice as fast as they were in 1973 but your average voter is as drunk and stupid as ever. The only one who's changed is me. I've become bitter and, let's face it, crazy over the years. And once I'm swept into office, I'll sell our children's organs to zoos for meat and I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place."
A Head in the Polls,Fry," Well, he lost my vote."
A Head in the Polls,Nixon," Like one vote ever made a difference. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to inch myself over to the phone and call the police."
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Not so fast, Nixon! Are you familiar with audio tape?"
A Head in the Polls,Nixon, Uh-oh. I don't like where this is heading.
A Head in the Polls,Nixon, [on tape] And I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place!
A Head in the Polls,Nixon, My God? I really sound like that? I thought my voice had more of a Clark Gable quality.
A Head in the Polls,Leela," The jig's up, Nixon. We'll trade you the tape for the body."
A Head in the Polls,Nixon," Oh, expletive deleted. You've got a deal."
A Head in the Polls,Fry," Hey, I've got one last thought."
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Ah, it's good to be back in one piece again. Except I can't get these damn bumper stickers off."
A Head in the Polls,Linda, [on TV] The sheer drama of this election has driven voter turnout to its highest level in centuries. 6%
A Head in the Polls,Morbo, [on TV] Exit polls show evil underdog Richard Nixon trailing with an estimated zero votes.
A Head in the Polls,Leela, Yes! The system works!
A Head in the Polls,Linda, [on TV] The time is 7 59 and the robot polls are now opening ... and the robot vote is in. Nixon has won!
A Head in the Polls,Leela, No!
A Head in the Polls,Fry, What?
A Head in the Polls,Bender, Get out of town!
A Head in the Polls,Fry, Why would robots vote for Nixon now that he's just a head in a jar?
A Head in the Polls,Nixon's campaign manager, I give you the next president of Earth!
A Head in the Polls,Nixon, [shouting] Nixon's back!
A Head in the Polls,Farnsworth, I can't believe it. He won by a single vote.
A Head in the Polls,Bender," Well it ain't my fault. I'm a non-voting felon, thank you."
A Head in the Polls,Fry, Well it's not my fault either 'cause I forgot to vote.
A Head in the Polls,Leela," Oh, crud. I knew there was something I meant to do today."
A Head in the Polls,Morbo, [on TV] Morbo congratulates our gargantuan cyborg president. May death come quickly to his enemies.
A Head in the Polls,Nixon, Aroo! Who's kicking who around now? [He rips away the fence outside the White House.] Aroo! Aroo!
A Head in the Polls,Nixon," Knock, knock!"
A Head in the Polls,,
Xmas Story,Announcer," Ladies and gentlemen, Conan O'Brien's head."
Xmas Story,O'Brien," Thank you, thank you. Let's get started. Max, play me over. [Max Weinberg's head is just a skull in a jar. O'Brien gasps.] Looks like someone forgot to feed Max. [Bender spits his drink out and laughs.] So, people are getting pretty worried about this Y2K problem, huh?"
Xmas Story,Bender," No, they fixed that 900 years ago."
Xmas Story,O'Brien," Just bear with me, sir. Anyway, I'm walking to work this morning--"
Xmas Story,Bender, I doubt it!
Xmas Story,O'Brien," Listen, pal, I may have lost my freakishly long legs in the war of 2012 but I've still got something you'll never have  A soul!"
Xmas Story,Bender, Eh.
Xmas Story,O'Brien," And freckles! [Bender cries.] Well, I'm out of material. You can catch me next week at the Andromeda Chuckle Hut. Enjoy your breakfast."
Xmas Story,Bender," Ah, let's face it  Comedy's a dead art form. Now, tragedy... [He laughs.] That's funny!"
Xmas Story,Farnsworth," Come on, everyone. Perhaps some skiing will help us forget the mouldy old antics of Conan O'Brien."
Xmas Story,Amy, Yeah!
Xmas Story,Leela, Great idea!
Xmas Story,Zoidberg, We can only hope!
Xmas Story,Fry, This snow is beautiful. I'm glad global warming never happened.
Xmas Story,Leela, Actually it did. But thank God nuclear winter cancelled it out.
Xmas Story,Fry, Hi!
Xmas Story,Bender," Enough of your mindless chitchat, let's get going."
Xmas Story,Hermes, Jah damnit! We're stuck.
Xmas Story,Zoidberg, [shivering] At least you're not cold-blooded!
Xmas Story,Hermes, Sweet lion of Zion! Look at the Professor go.
Xmas Story,Fry, Look out! We're heading straight for those trees!
Xmas Story,Leela," Yeah, yeah, relax. Trees down."
Xmas Story,Trees, [mechanical voice] Trees down.
Xmas Story,Fry," Cool. Hey, what do you do if you want the trees up?"
Xmas Story,Trees, [mechanical voice] Trees up.
Xmas Story,Fry, [hoarse] Trees down!
Xmas Story,Trees, [mechanical voice] Trees down.
Xmas Story,Bender," Lookin' good, meatball!"
Xmas Story,Man #1," Excuse me, sir, you're snowboarding off the trail."
Xmas Story,Bender," Lick my frozen, metal ass. [He laughs.] Uh-oh!"
Xmas Story,Child, [shouting] Mommy!
Xmas Story,Zoidberg," You, a bobsledder? That I'd like to see!"
Xmas Story,Hermes," Listen, you filthy crab, a thousand years ago there was a legendary team of Jamaican bobsledders."
Xmas Story,Fry," Yup, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics then retired to promote alcoholic beverages."
Xmas Story,Hermes," A true inspiration for the children. [A buzzer goes off and the gates open. The bobsled doesn't move forward and it tips over.] Um, a little help please? [Zoidberg pushes the bobsled and it slides down the track upside-down.] [screaming] Nooo!"
Xmas Story,Fry," Oh, what the hell! [He takes a run up and slides after Hermes and Zoidberg. He hits something at the bottom.] Ow!"
Xmas Story,Amy, You poor man. What happened to you?
Xmas Story,Man #2," Well, there I was on the triple diamond slope, when suddenly--"
Xmas Story,Amy," Oh, excuse me. [She runs over to a man in a whole body cast.] Hello, there!"
Xmas Story,Farnsworth, Wha?
Xmas Story,Bender, Ah! Nothing like a warm fire and a Super Soaker of fine cognac.
Xmas Story,Fry," Yeah, it really puts you in the Christmas spirit."
Xmas Story,Farnsworth, What-mas?
Xmas Story,Fry, Christmas. You know? X-M-A-S.
Xmas Story,Leela," Oh, you mean Xmas. You must be using an archaic pronunciation. Like when you say ""ask"" instead of ""aks""."
Xmas Story,Fry," Xmas, huh? [He sighs.] Y'know, this'll be my first Xmas away from home."
Xmas Story,Leela," Hey, hey. Let me aks you something  Would it cheer you up if we went and cut down an Xmas tree?"
Xmas Story,Fry, Yeah! An old-fashioned Xmas tree!
Xmas Story,Fry, Hey! These aren't Xmas trees!
Xmas Story,Farnsworth," Eh, wha?"
Xmas Story,Fry," They're supposed to be some kinda, you know, pine tree."
Xmas Story,Farnsworth," Pine trees have been extinct for 800 years, Fry. Gone the way of the poodle and your primitive notions of modesty. [He takes his coat off, exposing his naked body to all.] Ah! Brisk!"
Xmas Story,Fry, This isn't the way Christmas is supposed to be.
Xmas Story,Farnsworth," There, there."
Xmas Story,Fry, Everything's changed.
Xmas Story,Leela, That's not true.
Xmas Story,Bender," [singing]   Xmas tree, oh, Xmas tree! Bah-boo-bee-boo-bah-bee-boh."
Xmas Story,Amy, Ow!
Xmas Story,Fry, Every Christmas my mom would get a fresh goose for goose burgers and my dad would whip up his special eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes. [Amy flies around the room and crashes.] This dumb holiday just makes me think of all the things I left behind. Let's just stop talking about Xmas.
Xmas Story,Hermes," Happy Xmas, Xmas people! Xmas cards have arrived! Xmas! [The staff gather around.] Amy, there you go. Fry, Professor, Zoidberg, a mighty haul for Bender."
Xmas Story,Bender, Yes! I got the most! I win Xmas!
Xmas Story,Hermes," And last, but not least, the sweet flower of the office  Me. Hermes Conrad."
Xmas Story,Bender," Hmm. [He opens the card. The message reads ""Merry Xmas Son #1729"". With it is a photo of a robotic arm.] Ah, a picture of my mommy."
Xmas Story,Zoidberg," Huh? What's this? [His card it shaped like a lobster.] A card from my cousin Zoidfarb. [The message reads ""Santa ""Claws"" Cousin Zoidfarb"". Zoidberg chuckles.] Instead of ""Claus"" he writes ""Claws""! Now that's humorous. Today's comedians could learn from this card."
Xmas Story,Fry," What's the point of Xmas when everyone you know died a thousand years ago? I'm the loneliest person on Earth. [Enter Leela, drying her tears.] Hey, Leela, how 'bout a little sympathy here, huh? [She runs out crying more.] Yoiks! What was that about?"
Xmas Story,Amy, Fluh! She's an orphan.
Xmas Story,Farnsworth," Yes, and the only one of her species in all the known universe. What a lonely life."
Xmas Story,Fry, My God! Poor Leela.
Xmas Story,Bender," [upbeat] Hey, buddy, heard you needed cheering up! Well, old Bender'll make you laugh. [He dances around.] Look at me, look! [He scats and Fry bursts into tears.] Oh, man, I gotta work on my act!"
Xmas Story,Fry, I feel like a rat. Here I am whining like a pig while all along Leela was lonely as a frog. I could kick myself.
Xmas Story,Amy, I'll do it for you.
Xmas Story,Fry, Ow! Thanks.
Xmas Story,Farnsworth," You should be ashamed of yourself, Fry. You'd have to be blind not to notice that Leela's a cyclops."
Xmas Story,Hermes," Fry's over there, man."
Xmas Story,Farnsworth, Oh?
Xmas Story,Bender, Xmas Eve; another pointless day where I accomplish nothing.
Xmas Story,Linda, [on TV] The holiday season is a time of celebration for most. But it is also a time to remember the tragic suffering of the less fortunate.
Xmas Story,Morbo, [on TV] Earthlings do not yet know the meaning of suffering.
Xmas Story,Linda," [on TV] Earlier today I visited a shelter for down-and-out robots. [The TV picture cuts to a robot shelter.] Homeless robots, too poor to afford even the basic alcohol they need to fuel their circuits. Is there anything sadder? Only drowning puppies. And there would have to be a lot of them."
Xmas Story,Amy," Where are you going, Bender?"
Xmas Story,Bender, To volunteer at a liquor kitchen for homeless robots.
Xmas Story,Hermes," Yeah, right! As if you ever did anything charitable."
Xmas Story,Bender, I'm very generous. What about that time I gave blood?
Xmas Story,Fry, Whose blood?
Xmas Story,Bender, Some guy's.
Xmas Story,Fry, I've got to do something to show Leela how sorry I am.
Xmas Story,Zoidberg, So what's the problem? Just get down on your claws and do the apology dance.
Xmas Story,Fry," So it's left, left, right-- Wait! I have a better idea! I'll go out and get her the perfect Xmas present. Something so great she'll never want to be unhappy again."
Xmas Story,Hermes," Just be back by sundown, mon."
Xmas Story,Fry, We'll see. I like to haggle.
Xmas Story,Amy, You can't stay out on Xmas Eve. You'll be killed!
Xmas Story,Fry, Say what?
Xmas Story,Farnsworth, Good Lord! He doesn't know about Santa Claus.
Xmas Story,Fry, I know about Santa Claus.
Xmas Story,Farnsworth," Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot Company built a robotic Santa to determine who'd be naughty and who'd been nice and distribute presents accordingly. But something went wrong."
Xmas Story,Fry, Wow! 2801! Anyway...
Xmas Story,Farnsworth," Wait, you fool! Due to a programming error, Santa's standards were set too high and he invariably judges everyone to be naughty."
Xmas Story,Amy," If he catches you after dark, he'll chop off your head and stuff your neck full of toys from his sack of horrors."
Xmas Story,Farnsworth, Nice meeting you.
Xmas Story,Preacherbot," Welcome, brother! May the blessings of the season be upon you."
Xmas Story,Bender," Yeah, yeah, amen. Listen, I'm one of those lazy homeless bums I've been hearing about. Could you point me to the free booze. [The Preacherbot points.] Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!"
Xmas Story,Fry, There's this girl who I really like but she thinks I'm a jerk. Can you help me?
Xmas Story,Salesman #1," Yeah, there's a suicide booth in the food court. Though there's a line this time of year."
Xmas Story,Fry," No, I need to get her a gift. And I need it before sundown."
Xmas Story,Salesman #1," Well, you can't go wrong with something traditional. [He picks something up.] A Surface-to-Santa rocket launcher. It comes with three jolly-seeking missiles."
Xmas Story,Fry, That's funny!
Xmas Story,Salesman #1," Careful, sir!"
Xmas Story,Bender," Oh, yeah! You filthy hobos sure know how to live. [He turns to another robot.] Hey, chief, someone's stealing your handkerchief full of crap."
Xmas Story,Tinny Tim," Excuse me, sir? Might I have a sip of booze?"
Xmas Story,Preacherbot," I'm sorry, Tinny Tim. Seems we ran out early tonight."
Xmas Story,Tinny Tim, I understand.
Xmas Story,Bender, My God! That poor kid!
Xmas Story,Fry," You're the last store open. I need something for my friend Leela. [He looks at an eight-legged sausage dog, Bongo the rabbit from Life in Hell and a tiny giraffe in a birdcage. He doesn't like any of them.] Just give me your best animal."
Xmas Story,Salesman #2, Best? Well that's a matter of opinion. I personally like the Electric Snail.
Xmas Story,Fry, That's a stupid animal. You're stupid! I said I want the best one. Now which costs more? The parrot or the Stink Lizard?
Xmas Story,Salesman #2," The lizards are a buck each, the parrot is $500."
Xmas Story,Fry," That's a hell of a good parrot. Although, I could get 500 lizards for the same price. Girls like swarms of lizards, right?"
Xmas Story,Salesman #2," Sir, the store is closing in two minutes."
Xmas Story,Fry," Alright, I'll take the 500 lizards. No, wait, yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes! The parrot!"
Xmas Story,Fry," Well, I spent every penny I had but I bet Leela's gonna love you. [The parrot squawks.] Hey, you're quite the talker, aren't you? [It squawks again.] Shut the hell up! [It bites his nose.] Ow! [He drops the cage and the parrot flies out.] Stupid bird! I know where you live."
Xmas Story,Amy," Hey, it's Leela."
Xmas Story,Leela, Sorry I stormed out before. I didn't mean to ruin everyone's Xmas.
Xmas Story,Farnsworth, Huh? You were gone?
Xmas Story,Leela, It's just that I get tired of Fry always only thinking of himself.
Xmas Story,Hermes," I hear that! I aks him to set the table, instead he goes out to buy you a present. Selfish dog."
Xmas Story,Leela, Wait! You mean he's still out? His life's in danger!
Xmas Story,Zoidberg, Why?
Xmas Story,Leela, I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming to town!
Xmas Story,Fry," Alright, bird, you thought you could beat me in a game of wits. But you just met your equal."
Xmas Story,Fry, Aha! Cornered!
Xmas Story,Leela," Hi, there!"
Xmas Story,Fry," Leela! Oh, my God! You saved my life. I am gonna get you so many lizards!"
Xmas Story,Leela," You didn't need to buy me a present, Fry."
Xmas Story,Fry," I just wanted to do something to make you happy. I mean, I miss my family but you never even had a family."
Xmas Story,Leela," It's OK. You're lonely and I'm lonely. But, together, we're lonely together."
Xmas Story,Fry," Merry Xmas, Leela."
Xmas Story,Leela, Merry Xmas.
Xmas Story,Fry," Oh, boy! It's Santa!"
Xmas Story,Santa," Ho, ho, ho! [Fry and Leela back away.] You've been very naughty, Fry and Leela. I checked my list."
Xmas Story,Fry, Well check it twice!
Xmas Story,Santa, I perform over 50 mega-checks per second. You're both naughty for disregarding each other's feelings.
Xmas Story,Leela, But we set things right. Fry even risked his life to get me a present.
Xmas Story,Santa, But what about your other co-workers? Did either of you ever stop to think about Dr. Zoidberg's feelings?
Xmas Story,Fry, No! I swear!
Xmas Story,Santa, Santa has something very special in his sack for you two!
Xmas Story,Robots," [singing] So lock the door and hit the floor,"
Xmas Story,'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.,
Xmas Story,Hattie, Go away!
Xmas Story,Bender," Whoa, hold on! How about inviting us in for a traditional glass of hard cider?"
Xmas Story,Hattie," Oh, alright. But just one glass! [The robots go inside and she closes the door. We hear the robots guzzling down the cider.] [from inside] OK, that's enough. [They carry on drinking.] I said that's enough!"
Xmas Story,Bender, [from inside] Get her purse!
Xmas Story,Fry, Please let us live! We'll put out milk and cookies for you!
Xmas Story,Santa, You dare bribe Santa? I'm going to shove coal so far up your stocking you'll be coughing up diamonds!
Xmas Story,Leela, We're trapped.
Xmas Story,Fry," I never thought it would end this way  Gunned down by Santa Claus. Honestly, I didn't see it coming!"
Xmas Story,Leela," Goodbye, Fry."
Xmas Story,Fry," Goodbye, Leela. [They hug.] Hey, look, we're under the mistletoe."
Xmas Story,Santa, Your mistletoe is no match for my T.O.W. missile!
Xmas Story,Fry," Uh, you're present may need some assembly."
Xmas Story,Bender, [singing] On the 4th day of Xmas I stole from that lady.
Xmas Story,Robot #1, [singing] Four family photos.
Xmas Story,Tinny Tim, [singing] Three jars of pennies.
Xmas Story,Robot #2, [singing] Two former husbands.
Xmas Story,Bender, [singing] And a slipper on a shoe tree.
Xmas Story,Raoul," Oh, thank you!"
Xmas Story,Fry, [shouting] Help!
Xmas Story,Leela, [shouting] Somebody help us.
Xmas Story,Tinny Tim," It's humans. Shall we mug them, robot sir?"
Xmas Story,Bender," No, wait, I know these guys. They got nothing."
Xmas Story,Santa," Ho, ho, ho! [Bender panics.] You've been very naughty, Bender."
Xmas Story,Bender, What? Me? I didn't do nothing. You're thinking of the kid.
Xmas Story,Santa," My God, Bender! Framing an orphan? That's so naughty I'll have to add it to my list right now. [He pulls a list out and starts writing.] Framing ... I-N-G ... [The robots, Fry and Leela run away.] ... an..."
Xmas Story,Zoidberg," Amy, this is for you. A set of combs for your beautiful hair."
Xmas Story,Amy," Oh, that's so sweet. But I sold my hair to a wigmaker so I could buy a set of combs for Hermes."
Xmas Story,Hermes," Oh, the irony. I sold my hair so I could buy this third set of combs for Zoidberg."
Xmas Story,Zoidberg, Thank you. These'll come in handy for my new hair. [He pulls his hat off. Amy's and Hermes' hair is grafted to his head.] Finally I look as pretty as I feel!
Xmas Story,Fry, [shouting; from outside] Help!
Xmas Story,Leela, [shouting; from outside] Help!
Xmas Story,Bender, [shouting; from outside] Help!
Xmas Story,Farnsworth," Oh, dear. They'll be killed on our doorstep. And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd."
Xmas Story,Hermes, Sweet manatee of Galilee! He's on the roof!
Xmas Story,Farnsworth, Quick! The armour-plated chimney cover! [Fry and Leela run over to the cover and start to push it. It moves very slowly.] Push! Push!
Xmas Story,Bender, Use teamwork!
Xmas Story,Tinny Tim," Oh, dear! Oh, dear!"
Xmas Story,Santa," You've all been very naughty, very naughty indeed. Except you, Dr. Zoidberg, this is for you."
Xmas Story,Zoidberg, A pogo-stick!
Xmas Story,Santa," As for the rest of you, I'm going to tear off your skin like wrapping paper and deck the halls with your guts."
Xmas Story,Bender," Yeah? Well I don't believe in Santa Claus. Come on, everybody, if you don't believe in him, he can't hurt you. [Santa whacks Bender over the head with his sack.] Ow! God! The pain!"
Xmas Story,Santa," Ho, ho, ho! Time to get jolly on your naughty asses!"
Xmas Story,Leela, Watch out! His belly is shaking like a bowl full of nitro-glycerine!
Xmas Story,Amy, Rudolph's nose!
Xmas Story,Fry, [shouting] He's gonna blow!
Xmas Story,Zoidberg, Aha!
Xmas Story,Farnsworth," Yes, good thing I got us out of that one!"
Xmas Story,Bender," Xmas dinner, everyone."
Xmas Story,Fry," Uh, Bender? Where did you get that bird?"
Xmas Story,Bender," I found it lying in the street, like all the food I cook. Dig in, everyone."
Xmas Story,Tinny Tim," Thank you, sir."
Xmas Story,Bender, You got the toenail! [Nibbler eats the rest of the parrot and snatches Tinny Tim's piece off his plate.] Oh!
Xmas Story,Fry," Look, the food isn't what's important."
Xmas Story,Tinny Tim, I'm so hungry.
Xmas Story,Fry," The important thing is we're all together for Xmas. And even though I'm surrounded by robots and monsters and old people, I've never felt more at home."
Xmas Story,Farnsworth," Hear, hear! Now let's all of us shut up and sing!"
Xmas Story,Amy, [singing] He knows when you are sleeping.
Xmas Story,Farnsworth, [singing] He knows when you're on the can.
Xmas Story,Leela, [singing] He'll hunt you down and blast your ass from here to Pakistan.
Xmas Story,Zoidberg, [singing] Oh.
Xmas Story,Hermes," [singing] You'd better not breathe, You'd better not move."
Xmas Story,Bender," [singing] You're better off dead, I'm telling you, dude."
Xmas Story,Fry, [singing] Santa Claus is gunning you down!
Xmas Story,Farnsworth," Merry Xmas, everyone!"
Xmas Story,Santa," [over credits] I'll be back. Back when you least expect it  Next Xmas! Ho, ho, ho!"
Xmas Story,,
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Singer, [voice-over; singing; on TV] Call Robo-Rooter when you flush your towel.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Plumber-bot, [singing; on TV] And we can also help with an impacted bowel.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Singer, [voice-over; singing; on TV] Robo-Rooter!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, Mmm. Mmm! Now this is what I call a thousand years of progress  A Bavarian cream dog that's also self-microwaving!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender," Aw, jeez. Let's just pray I have the energy to get myself another beer. [On the remote he presses a ""beer"" button. A hatch on the top of the TV opens up and an extending arm carrying a beer bottle extends across the room. It flicks the bottle-cap off and Bender opens his mouth. The arm tips the bottle up and the beer splashes on Bender's chest.] Oh, what is this, the Middle Ages?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela," Look at you guys. No offence, Fry, but you've become a fat sack of crap."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, Sack?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Amy," And, Bender, your beer belly's so big your door won't even close. And that doesn't even make sense."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela, Come on. We're taking you pigs to the gym.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," The gymnasium? Excellent, excellent. For some reason I'm frisky as a squid on Tuesday."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Amy," Hey, who's up for a nice, hot steam?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, We crustaceans don't like steam. I'm going to go work out with the Nautilus!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Nautilus," What up, Dr. Z?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," Yo, yo, yo! Whassup, whassup! Give up the rock!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela," Uh, Fry, you're in the women's steam room."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," Ah, futuristic!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Amy," Psst, look what life was like before genetic engineering."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela, Those poor 20th century women.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Amy," [sexfully] Hey, handsome. Is there room in there for two?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Man, You wish!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," Hey, Leela, look who's the super-stud!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela," Hmm, somebody must have turned down the gravity. I'll fix it for you."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," Give me that. [He lifts the weights off Fry, knocks him off the bench and takes his place. Enter Amy and Bender.] More weight!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, what's that jazz on your head?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, Enough with the questions. More weight! [The four add more weights.] More! [Amy and Fry leap onto the weights.] More!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela, Maybe you could do more reps with less weight.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender," Hey, looks like Zoidberg's finally coming out of his shell. [He chuckles.] Get it? [He chuckles again.] He's coming out--"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Randy," Nice and gentle, we don't want any unnecessary stress. [Zoidberg appears in the middle of the pool. The women scream and he scuttles out of the water. A woman spontaneously gives birth and her baby cries.] Is there a doctor in the gym?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, I'm a doctor!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela, I wonder why Dr. Zoidberg is acting this way. Out of all of us he always seemed the most normal.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," I am normal. [sexfully] Amy, take off these rubber bands and I'll show you how normal I am!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Amy," Fool me seven times, shame on you. Fool me eight or more times, shame on me."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, Maybe he has a parasite.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Hermes, Maybe he is a parasite!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender, It's always so sad when a friend goes crazy and you have to have a big clam-bake and cook him! Yee-haw!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Farnsworth," Now, now, this won't do. Let me just give old Zoidy a sedative."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," Ah, much better. You can take off these rubber bands now."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Amy, I'll do it.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela, [simultaneous] Stop!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," [simultaneous] No, Amy!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender, Moron!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Farnsworth, Mm-hm... [He puts it on his shoulder.] Oh-ho! [He puts it on his chest.] Aha! There's the problem.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," Give it to me straight, Professor. Is it fin rot? It's fin rot, isn't it? Tell me it's not fin rot!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Farnsworth," Relax, my chiton-y chum. There's no problem. You're just heavy with male jelly."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela, Bleck!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Farnsworth, It must be mating season for Zoidberg's people; a chaotic time when his behaviour is dictated by the tiny brain in his rump.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, Eck!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Farnsworth, There's only one thing we can do--
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender, I'll get the water boiling!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Farnsworth," We, by which I mean you, will have to rush him to his ancient homeworld which will shortly erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," Oh, baby, I'm there!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela," Fry, do you even understand the word ""invertebrate""?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," Nope, but that's not the word I'm interested in. [shouting] Uh, no need to pack pants, people. Let's roll!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Amy, Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these while he's gone.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender, [from inside] Moron!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Decapodian Man #1," Welcome home, old friend. Just 19 hours until the mating frenzy!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," Excellent, excellent!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Decapodian Man #1," See you there, Doctor--"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," Is that how you say ""Zoidberg""?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, You didn't have to call attention to his speech impediment.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender," You're looking less nuts, crabby."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," I'm feeling less nuts, thank you, because tomorrow I will be depositing my jelly in the cloacal vents of a female. [sexfully] If you catch my drift."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, [nudging Zoidberg] Who's the lucky lobsterina?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, I don't know yet. But I shall attract one this afternoon with an erotic display.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela, It's amazing that your people can fall in love so fast.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, Love? That word is unknown here. I'm simply looking for a female swollen with eggs to accept my genetic material.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," You and me both, brother!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," Ah, my old scuttling grounds! Let's pull over."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," I used to hang out here as a larva. It looked so much bigger back then. [A tiny crustacean crawls out of the rock pool. Zoidberg picks it up.] Who's the tough guy now, Vinnie?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender," Look! Outdoor theatre! Let's get tickets. Oh, let's do!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," No, it's the ceremony of Claw-Plach, where my species fight to the death over matters of honour. Also whether abbreviations count in Scrabble. [angry] They don't!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, I didn't come here to see any activity involving two guys. Where do you people do your erotic display?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, Same place as your species  The beach.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, How do I look?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender, Like whale barf.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, Then the illusion is complete.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," Hey, I wonder if these guys are here to watch the erotic display too."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Decapodian Man #2," Aw, yeah! Aw, wow!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, Perfect! This oughta make me stand out. [He jumps onto the mound and his fin pops up again. Some women walk past.] Craw!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, Look how ridiculous they look.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender," Please, he's no different from the rest of you organisms; shooting DNA at each other make babies. I find it offensive."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, Craw!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Decapodian Woman #1, Keep your jelly away from my eggs!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, Craw?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Decapodian Woman #2, So not interested.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, Craw!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Decapodian Woman #3, Humph. I've heard that line before!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," Cra-- Oh, what's the point?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela, Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender," 'Cause he's a loser, that's why. He's the lobster equivalent of Fry."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, Hey! I can get any girl I want anytime I want. I'm just too busy.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," Edna? Edna, it's me, Zoidberg. Remember, from high school? [Edna makes a questioning purr.] You used to laugh at me because my face was covered with barnacles!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna, Zoidberg? Well I didn't know you were back in town. I heard you went off and became a rich doctor.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," I've performed a few mercy killings. So, as long as I'm in town I was wondering if maybe ... craw?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna," Oh, gee, yeah, I'm just going through a lot of things right now and-- Look, Zoidberg, I carry more eggs than any other female and I owe it to our race to pick a mate who's stuffed with male jelly. Maybe a rock star."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, Or maybe a doctor?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna," I'm sorry, Zoidberg. You're just an inferior male specimen. Nice seeing you again."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," [crying] No one will ever want to mate with me, not with a puny claw like this. Did you see those other guys? They looked like giant claws with bodies attached."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela, At least you didn't smell as bad as them.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," [crying] You're right, my stink gland is weak. Smell!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," Listen, Doc, if you wanna score you gotta fake like you're in love. [He takes Leela's hand.] Just look her in the eye, start crying and say [fake crying] ""I've never been so happy."""
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela, If a guy ever did that to me I'd know it. Wait a second. They've all been doing that to me. Even Sean!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," Hmm, this ""love"" intrigues me. Teach me to fake it."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," OK, you're on a date. What's the first thing you do?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, Ask her to mate with me.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, No. Tell her she's special.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, But she's not. She's merely the female with the largest clutch of eggs.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," Well, tell her that. And then?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, Then mating.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, No. Make up some feelings and tell her you have them. [Zoidberg raises his hand.] Yes?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," Is ""desire to mate"" a feeling?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, You're not even trying!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, It's all so complicated with the flowers and the romance and the lies upon lies.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," OK, OK, don't worry. The love meister will take you under his wing."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, What? Now there's a bird involved?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," OK, go ahead."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna," What the-- Dr. Zoidberg, your mating display failed. Why are you trying to talk to me?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, [shouting] I have no idea.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," [whispering] You just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," [shouting] I just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating. [whispering] Fry, that doesn't make sense."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna," Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But OK."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, [whispering] Start with a compliment. Tell her she looks thin.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, [shouting] You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from internal parasites?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna," Why, yes. Thanks for noticing."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, [whispering] Now ask her how her day was.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, Why would I wanna know?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, [whispering] You wouldn't. Ask anyway.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, [shouting] How was your day?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna, Well first I got up and had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth. Then I went to the store to buy some fish. Then...
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," Fry, look what you did, she won't shut up."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," [whispering] That's normal. Just nod your head and say ""Uh-huh""."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," [nodding] Uh-huh, uh-huh."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna," ...And then you threw an octopus at my window. You know, Zoidberg, it's crazy but when you talk this way your obvious deficiencies as a male seem ... less obvious. Your genes seem less detrimental. [She sniffs.] You even stink more."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, Do I ask her to mate now?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, [whispering] Third date!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender, So I returned his artificial heart and ever since then I've been known by the name of Honest Bender.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, [reading] I'd like to propose a toast to ... coat check number 84.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, [whispering] Turn it over.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," Oh, Edna! [reading] Of all the slimy, gross crab monsters on this planet, you are apparently the hottest."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender, Oy.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, [wiping a tear] That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna," Yes, well ... excuse me, I've got to powder my mouth flaps."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela," Uh, me too."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," I'm confused, Fry. I'm feeling a strange new emotion. Is it love when you care about a female for reasons beyond mating?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, Nope. Must be some weird alien emotion.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela," Zoidberg said some dumb stuff but he's a nice guy, really. It's just that Fry's been telling him what to say and Fry's a ... do you have idiots on your planet?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna, Fry? You mean words of such beauty came from the blowhole of that hideous alien?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela," Yeah ... what? Look, never mind the words. Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor, honey."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna, Hmm.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna, [from inside] Come in.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna," [sexfully] Hello, Fry. Can I interest you in some surf and turf?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, No thanks. I just came to tell you that Zoidberg's really great. He's got male jelly coming out the wazoo.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna," Well that is where it comes out but jelly isn't everything. [She comes closer.] I know Zoidberg's magical words were really yours. Teach me to love you, squishy poet from beyond the stars!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," Uh, I'm flattered, really. If I was gonna do it with a big, freaky mud bug you'd be way up the list!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna," Hush, you romantic fool! Engage your mandibles and kiss me!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," Edna, I couldn't stand it any longer. I-- [He sees Fry and screams. Fry manages to break away from Edna's grip and gasps for air.] [angry] Fry!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," Dr. Zoidberg, it's not how it looks."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, [angry] Her caviar is on your neck!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, But--
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna," Oh, it's true, Zoidberg. We can't hide it any longer. Fry and I have fallen in love and we're going to mate tomorrow."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, What?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, [angry] Fry! [His fin reappears and knocks his hat off.] I challenge you to Claw-Plach!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," English, please?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, A fight to the death.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna," And if you survive, we'll make sweet love!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Decapodian Emperor, The law is clear. Fry and Zoidberg shall fight to the death for the claw of the beautiful Edna.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, But I don't want her!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Decapodian Emperor," Once invoked, the sacred tradition of Claw-Plach can not be taken back. It is a recent tradition, only 18 years old, but it is a tradition none the less."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," Get ready, Fry. I'm going to rip your swim bladder out and show it to you."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela," Dr. Zoidberg, this is madness. You're being irrational."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, [shouting] Of course I'm being irrational! I'm in love!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela, Aww.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, Leela!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela," Right, right. [She turns to the Emperor.] You have to stop this madness."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Decapodian Emperor," Listen, lady, as you can plainly see I'm a highly desirable male, groaning with jelly. Yet I embrace a life of celibacy in order to uphold our crazy traditions. One of your friends must die."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender," Fate is cruel and unyielding and what must be must be. [shouting] Takin' all bets! I'm giving 9-2 on Zoidberg, the crab with the jab! The Great Red Hope! Come on, baby!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," Fry, it's been years since medical school so remind me. Disembowelling in your species  Fatal or non-fatal?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, Fatal.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, Large bet on myself in round one!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Decapodian Emperor," Edna, have you anything to say before begins the Claw-Plach?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna, I do. I just want to say that today I got up and I had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth--
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, [shouting] Shut up!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna," I love you, Fry!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Decapodian Emperor," Fry, having guessed what animal I was thinking of, you shall have first choice of weapon. [Fry chooses a pair of giant nutcrackers from a case.] And you, doctor?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, I choose my own claws! I want the tactile pleasure of chopping him right here in the gonads!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, Shh! Nobody correct him!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender," Fry, I've never asked you for anything before but, if it's not too much trouble, when it comes to the ninth round just let him win."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, But it's a fight to the death!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender," Oh, so this is suddenly all about you. Sheesh!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Decapodian Emperor, Please rise for the national anthem.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, Uh-oh.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Decapodian Emperor, [shouting] Let Claw-Plach begin!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, Hey!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender, Ow!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela," [shouting] Come on, Fry! Die with dignity!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, Aha! [He hits Zoidberg's hands with the nutcrackers and Zoidberg flies over his head and lands on his feet.] Oops!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Edna, [screaming] Nooo! I can't stand to look.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, Huh?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender," Psst, Fry. Take a dive."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Crowd, [chanting] Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! [Fry looks around at the crowd.] Claw-Plach! [He takes the nutcrackers from around Zoidberg's neck and throws them aside.] Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," My fellow fish monsters, far be it for me to question your stupid civilisation or its dumb customs, but is squeezing each other's brains out with a giant nutcracker really going to solve anything? Dr. Zoidberg is my friend, and though a woman has come between us, I say we'll always remain friends. And you know why? [He raises his arm.] One reason. [Zoidberg cuts his arm off with one clean click of the claws. Fry looks at his lifeless arm on the ground and pulls his shirt up around his wound.] You bastard! I'll kill you! You bastard!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela, Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, Edna? Honey?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, Edna?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela, Ew!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender," Oh, my God!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," The frenzy! [His fin disappears back into his head.] Oh, the greatest experience in life and I missed it."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," Aw. I'm sorry, Doc."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," Ow, ow! Ah!"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, The frenzy is over. How will I ever get rid of my male jelly now?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, [holding up his arm] I'll lend you this.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela, Fry!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," Hey, hey."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender, Shoo! Get away! Hey! What's with the flying jerks?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," They come to feast after the frenzy. Once my species passes on its genes, it dies."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, You mean you have to choose between a life without sex and a gruesome death?
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg, Yes.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, Tough call.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," Well it was nice of you to let me reattach your arm, Fry, especially after I made a complete eel out of myself."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, No biggie.
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," Yes biggie. I learned to feel things I'd never felt before  Love, jealousy, passion for disembowelling. I owe it all to you. [He finishes reattaching the arm.] There! I pronounce the operation a success."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Leela, Hooray!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Bender, Yeah!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, [laughing] Yeah!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," I may not know from emotions but when it comes to medicine, forget about it."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry," I don't mean to nitpick, super-doc, but do you think maybe you could take one more whack at this?"
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," For you, my friend, anything."
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Fry, [from ship] My legs!
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?,Zoidberg," [from ship] Alright, alright, third time's the charm."

The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, Nah. If I ever wanna go back to the year 2000 I'll just freeze myself again.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," C'mon, Fry, I really wanna see it. You know how I yearn for a simpler time. A time of barn dances and buggy rides, before life was cheapened by heartless hi-tech machines."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," But, Bender, you are--"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah..."

The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," I gotta say I'm really enjoying the day out with you people. Hey, a suicide booth! So long, suckers."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," Uh, sorry, Bender, that's just a phone booth."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender, [disappointed] Oh.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela, What were they used for?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, In New York? Bathrooms.

The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela, [reading] Tokens only. [talking] How does this work?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, I'll show you. [He hops over it.] Whup.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," Oh, it's a turnstile."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela, What's this? [She sniffs.] Another bathroom?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," No, it's a mobile apartment with no rent."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," C'mon, Fry. Get up!"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," Wow! The burial chamber of the 20th century's greatest spiritual leader, Al Sharpton."

The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela, It says he was mummified in ceremonial vestments.

Here we see a 20th century assembly line where cars were constructed by primitive robots."

The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," Fry, remember when I told you about always ending your stories a sentence earlier?"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," C'mon, let's sneak in for a closer look."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Man," Sir, we don't touch the antiques. sir. You-- Oh! [He chuckles.] I'm sorry. You work here. I should have realised from that ridiculous getup you're wearing."

The Lesser of Two Evils,Man," Here, move this rust bucket outside behind St. Koch's Cathedral."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," Did you drive much in the 20th century, Fry?"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, Nope. [He starts the engine.] No one in New York drove. There was too much traffic. [He moves the gear lever.] Nice! Listen to that baby purr.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," There's a baby in there, huh?"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, It's just like riding a bicyc--
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender, I think I got whiplash.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," You can't have whiplash, you don't have a neck."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender, I meant ass whiplash.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, I'm just glad we hit something. I thought we'd never stop.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bending Unit, Ow! I think I got whiplash.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, How's that robot I ran over?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Farnsworth, We did all we could.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, You mean he's--
The Lesser of Two Evils,Farnsworth, Good as new? Yes!
The Lesser of Two Evils,Farnsworth," Leela, Zoidberg, the rest of you, this is Flexo."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Hermes," Sweet llamas of the Bahamas! Except for that stylish beard, he looks just like Bender!"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo," No duh, dreadlock, we're both bending units."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," Hey, brobot, what's you serial number?"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo, 3370318.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender, No way! Mine's 2716057!
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, I don't get it.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender, We're both expressible as the sum of two cubes.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," So, uh, Flexo. Sorry about crushing your body like that. You OK now?"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo," Well I don't feel as bad as you look! [He laughs.] Nah, I'm just messing with you, kid. You're alright. That's some face you got, though. I think they got a cream for that. [He laughs again.] Nah, you're great."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, Well just let me know if there's anything I can do to make it up to you.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo," Actually, your little stunt did a number on my back. You mind rubbin' it for me?"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, Uh ... sure.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo," Aw, yeah, that's it. Little lower."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, How's that?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo, Lower. [He goes further down.] Yeah that's gettin' it. A little lower though.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," Uh, I can't get any lower than this."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo," I'll say, you're rubbing my ass!"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Robot #1," Hey, check it out here. Six beautiful devices. They know what you like and they'll do it to within a tolerance of one micron!"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Robot #2," Yeah! Spin those fans, baby!"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Robot #3," Alright, mama!"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Robot #4," Gyrate, baby!"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, I don't like this place. It's 120 degrees and there's very little oxygen.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," Shut up and hoot. [The lights dim and a chunky Fembot with no distinguishing facial features rolls out on some tracks with a feather boa around her ""neck"". The robots cheer and wave their money at her.] Hubba-hubba, she is built -- in Mexico, I believe."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo," And that ain't silicon, it's tungsten. And plenty of it!"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," [unsure] Uh, yeah. Look at that exhaust fan."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo, Ew!
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender, Pervert.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo, Yoo-hoo!
The Lesser of Two Evils,Stripperbot," Thanks, moderate spender. Please select erotic transaction."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo," Yeah, how 'bout a lap dance for my pal here?"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," Uh, no, no, that's alright. [She leans on him and he struggles.] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," I'm telling you, there's something about Flexo I don't like."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo," Hey, Fry, think fast. [He opens his chest cabinet and a gas blasts Fry in the face, making him cough.] Get it? It's chlorine!"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Zoidberg, It's funny because it's poisonous!
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," Yeah, keep laughing, brine shrimp, but he's bad news. I regret ever running him over."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Hermes," Take a rage dump, man. He's no worse than Bender."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, He's much worse. He drinks and smokes and he posts naked pictures of me on the Internet.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Amy," That's Bender, alright."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, I'm talking about Flexo.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," Oh, I get it. This is cute. You're jealous of Bender's new friend!"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," No, I'm not. Mark my words  Flexo's evil. He's the evil Bender."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Hermes, Rage dump!
The Lesser of Two Evils,Farnsworth," [on screen] Good news, everyone. Report to my bedroom for a private exhibition."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Farnsworth, Everyone get in bed with me. I have something to show you. [Everyone climbs on and Farnsworth presses a button and makes the curtains around the bed close. What goes on inside is hidden from view.] Feast your eyes on this!
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela, It's beautiful.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Amy, And huge.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, Can I touch it?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Zoidberg," So what is it, already?"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Farnsworth," It's a single atom of jumbonium, an element so rare the nucleus alone is worth more than $50,000."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender, How much more?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Farnsworth," 100,000. That's why I hid it here, under my mattress."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," Uh, Professor, can we discuss this somewhere else?"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Farnsworth, Why certainly.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Farnsworth," The atom sits atop this dimestore tiara which will be awarded to the winner of this year's Miss Universe pageant on the planet Tova 9. [He puts the atom on the tiara and it floats.] Your job is to deliver it, safe and sound."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Amy, Wow! When I was a little girl on Mars I dreamed of being Miss Universe.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela, That's kinda pathetic.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Amy," Aw, come on, Leela. Deep down all girls wanna be Miss Universe."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela, Not me.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Amy, Really? Maybe it's just cute girls.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Farnsworth," Due to the atoms tremendous value, Planet Express would go bankrupt if it was stolen. Therefore we'll need to hire on additional security for the mission."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo," Oh, oh, oh, oh! Mr. Professor, right here!"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," Uh, maybe we should stick with people we know and trust. I mean, Flexo's great, but--"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Farnsworth," ""Flexo's great,"" you say? Well that's good enough for me. [He shakes Flexo's hand.] Welcome aboard, lad."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," Space bandidos have been operating in this quadrant so you'll each take 8-hour shifts guarding the safe. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," Wait, hold on. I don't like the sound of that. Let's just go alphabetically."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," Wait, let's go by rank."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, Flexo outranks me?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo," That's ""Flexo outranks me, sir""!"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender, Halt. Who goes there?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, Don't point that at me.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," ""Fry"" who?"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," Look, I know Flexo's your friend but I don't trust him alone with the atom."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," My God, Fry! Just 'cause the guy's got a beard you label him as evil? Well I got a label for you, pal  An ugly little word called ""prejudice""."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, I'm not prejudiced.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," Ah, save it for the cross-burning, Adolf!"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo, Keeping an eye on the safe?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender, You know it!
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo," Well, looks like it's my shift. You lie down and go offline for a while."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender, Alright.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, Caught you! [Flexo panics.] I saw you looking at the atom!
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo, So? I look at lots of atoms. Shouldn't you be resting up for your shift?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," Oh-ho, you'd like it if I went to sleep, wouldn't you?"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo," Whatever it takes to shut your yapper. [He laughs.] Nah, I'm just kidding, you're a joker."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," Yeah, well here's a funny joke  I'm gonna sit right here till it's my shift."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo," Suit yourself, skinbag."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, That I will.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo, Good.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, Good.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo, Good.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, Good.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo, Good.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, Good. [Flexo doesn't reply.] Good.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," Well, that's eight hours."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo," Yeah, eight hours of solid boredom. [He laughs.] Nah, I'm kidding, you're a wonderful man."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," Finally, the atom is safe."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela, What is it? [She gasps.] My God! Did you hear maracas?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, No.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," Then it wasn't space bandidos. [She turns around.] Bender, lock down the ship. Don't let Flexo escape."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," Aye aye, Captain. It appears that Flexo has outwitted us all. Especially me ... Bender."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela, How could Flexo have stolen the atom?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," He must have used a sleep-ray on me. Sleep-rays exist in the future, right?"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela, No.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, Oh. Then I must've fallen asleep.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela, Well you were sure right about Flexo being evil.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender, I locked down the exits but he may have already gotten away.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," OK, thanks, Bender. Let's fan out and look for him."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," Roger that, I got a map of the ship right here."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela, [whispering] Keep an eye on Fry. We can't rule out the possibility that he did it.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela, Aha!
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," Aha! [He opens a drawer but there is no Flexo, just Leela's panties. He rummages around anyway.] Uh, searching ... hmm."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela, Fry? Why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants drawer?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago so I thought it was time to check again.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," Well, he wasn't in the, uh, kitchen room."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," [suspicious] Say, Bender, can I hold that map for a second?"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender, And leave me high and dry in case of a scavenger hunt? I think not.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, Give it up!
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," Alright, take it. Sheesh!"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," Well, looks like Flexo got away clean."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender, It's a darn shame.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela, He must have jumped ship with the atom the second we landed.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," Or maybe, he never left at all! [He pulls the scarf off the robot.] Wait a minute. You're Bender."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," Of course, who said I wasn't?"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, But why were you wearing that scarf and the turtleneck and this fruity number?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," It's a little thing called ""style"". Look it up sometime."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Barker," Our ninth finalist, Miss Methane Planet, Halatina Smogmeyer. [Halatina is made entirely of gas and blows in, waving and smiling at the audience. They cheer and cough from the fumes.] And our tenth and final finalist, Miss Earth's Moon, The Crushinator."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Crushinator," [mechanical voice] Thank you, Bob Barker. I'm as happy as a girl can be. End statement."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Barker, Which one of these lovely womanoids will take home the atomic tiara?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela, [whispering] Downplay the tiara.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Barker," Uh, we'll find out after these subliminal messages."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Barker," So you lost the atom, huh? You're garbage, human garbage! Do you brain-dead space jockeys have any idea how much that thing is worth?"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," 100,000?"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," 200,000?"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," 200,001?"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Barker, [to Leela] You're closest without going over.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," Well, uh, we'll be leaving now. If you'll just sign this form saying you received the atom."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Barker, I'm not signing squat. You find me that damn tiara before the pageant ends.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," But, Mr. Barker--"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Barker," Enough out of you. I may be against the fur industry, but that won't stop me from skinning you alive! As long as no one wears the skin."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," Well, gentlemen, it appears we're boned."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, Flexo!
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela, Get him!
The Lesser of Two Evils,Barker," Next up in what is generously called the ""Talent Competition"", performing a traditional gangsta rap, Miss-- What the--"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender, Gotcha!
The Lesser of Two Evils,Women, [chanting] Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," Shoot him, he's choking me!"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo," No shoot him, he's choking me!"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela, I don't know which one to shoot.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, Flexo! Shoot Flexo!
The Lesser of Two Evils,Amazonian, Women-only room!
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," Alright, enough of this. [She shoots a display of model planets hanging from the ceiling and they fall and knock Bender and Flexo to the floor. Another planet bounces onto one of the doors, revealing the atom. Gasps all around. Bender sits up. The atom is in his chest cabinet.] There's the atom!"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," Aw, jeez."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, Bender? You stole the atom?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," Yeah, but I can explain, it's very valuable."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo, I saw him snatch it while Fry was asleep. That's why I ran to tell Bob Barker.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," Whoa, whoa, wait a second. You mean Bender is the evil Bender? I am shocked. Shocked! Well not that shocked."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," I'm sorry we suspected you, Flexo. It's just, what with the beard and all--"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo," Don't even bother. You people sicken me. I put my life on the line to guard that atom and this is how you repay me? Well you can go rot for all I care. [He laughs his anger away.] Nah, I'm just kidding, you guys are alright."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, I'm so confused. The Bender I liked turn out to be evil and the Bender I hated was good. How can I live my life when I can't tell good from evil?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender," Eh, they're both fine choices. Whatever floats your boat."
The Lesser of Two Evils,URL, Is this the guy?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Barker," Huh? Oh, yeah, that looks like him. Whatever."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Flexo," Wait, but I--"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Barker, Take him away.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Barker," Alright, let's put an end to this pathetic hoedown. Brannigan, read the thing."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Zapp, And the winner is...
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," It figures. Who else but Zapp Brannigan would be judging the most chauvinistic, degrading, dehumanising--"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Zapp, Huh? Leela?
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," Wait, you're making a-- [Some flowers are handed to her.] Ooh! Look at that. [A woman puts the tiara on her head.] I feel like a princess!"
The Lesser of Two Evils,Zapp," Wait. What are you people? Idiots? I'm still going mano a mano with this envelope. [He struggles with the envelope and finally rips it open. He takes out a piece of paper.] And the winner is  Miss Vega 4. [The women take the flowers and tiara from Leela and put it on Miss Vega 4, a big purple splodge. She waves to the audience.] [singing] There it is, Miss Universe. There it is, looking weird."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela, I almost had that tiara.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Bender, Me too.
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry," Well, you guys might both be losers but I just made out with that radiator woman from the radiator planet."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Leela," Fry, that's a radiator."
The Lesser of Two Evils,Fry, Oh. [He clears his throat.] Is there a burn ward within 10 feet of here?
The Lesser of Two Evils,,
The Series Has Landed,Farnsworth," As new employees, I'd like your opinion on our commercial. I paid to have it air during the Super Bowl."
The Series Has Landed,Fry, Wow!
The Series Has Landed,Farnsworth," Not on the same channel, of course."
The Series Has Landed,Announcer, [voice-over; on screen] Interplanetary deliveries - what a headache!
The Series Has Landed,Horrible Gelatinous Blob, [on screen] Evans! Where's that package from Earth?
The Series Has Landed,Man, [on screen] Uh... [Horrible Gelatinous Blob eats him. The man is suspended in the creature's translucent body.] [shouting] I'm not Evans!
The Series Has Landed,Horrible Gelatinous Blob, [on screen] He should've used Planet Express!
The Series Has Landed,Announcer," [voice-over; on screen] When those other companies aren't brave or foolhardy enough to go, trust Planet Express for reliable, on time delivery."
The Series Has Landed,Evans," [on screen] Here's your package, Mr. Horrible Gelatinous Blob."
The Series Has Landed,Horrible Gelatinous Blob," [on screen] Good work, Evans! You've got a future around here."
The Series Has Landed,Evans," [on screen] Thank you, sir!"
The Series Has Landed,Announcer, [voice-over; on screen] Planet Express  Our crew is replaceable. Your package isn't.
The Series Has Landed,Fry, Are there really giant birds like that?
The Series Has Landed,Farnsworth," No, no! That was all just special effects! Now let's have breakfast. I hope everyone likes eggs."
The Series Has Landed,Fry, I'm never going to get used to the 31st century. [He points to his breakfast.] Caffinated bacon? Baconated grapefruit? Admiral Crunch?
The Series Has Landed,Leela," Well, if you don't like that, try some Archduke Chocula."
The Series Has Landed,Farnsworth," Ah, Hermes! Crew, meet Hermes Conrad. He manages my delivery business, pays the bills, notifies next of kin, what have you."
The Series Has Landed,Hermes, Someone come and dropped this package through the slot last night. Now which one of you is the captain?
The Series Has Landed,Farnsworth," Oh, my! I haven't picked a new captain yet. It's always so hard to choose."
The Series Has Landed,Fry," Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh!"
The Series Has Landed,Farnsworth," Hmm, you!"
The Series Has Landed,Hermes," OK, Captain, this is just a standard legal release protecting Planet Express from lawsuits in the event of the unforeseen."
The Series Has Landed,Leela, [reading] Death by airlock failure.
The Series Has Landed,Hermes, Mm.
The Series Has Landed,Leela, [reading] Death by brain parasite.
The Series Has Landed,Hermes, Yeah.
The Series Has Landed,Leela, [reading] Death by sonic diarrhoea?
The Series Has Landed,Hermes," [chuckling] Oh, you don't want that!"
The Series Has Landed,Leela," Look, I don't know about any of your previous captains but I intend to do as little dying as possible."
The Series Has Landed,Hermes, Sign the paper!
The Series Has Landed,Farnsworth," Now, Fry, before you go into space you'll need to see our staff doctor. I should warn you though, he's a little ... unusual. [whispering] He wears sandals!"
The Series Has Landed,Fry, Hi--
The Series Has Landed,Farnsworth," Dr. Zoidberg, this is Fry, the new delivery boy. He needs a physical."
The Series Has Landed,Zoidberg," Excellent, excellent!"
The Series Has Landed,Farnsworth, You'll be fine.
The Series Has Landed,Zoidberg," Now open your mouth and let's have a look at that brain. [Fry opens his mouth.] No, no, no, no, no, not that mouth!"
The Series Has Landed,Fry, I only have one.
The Series Has Landed,Zoidberg, Really?
The Series Has Landed,Fry," Uh, is there a human doctor around?"
The Series Has Landed,Zoidberg," Young lady, I'm an expert on humans. Now pick a mouth, open it and say... [He makes a weird noise. Fry clears his throat and tries to imitate him but fails.] What? My mother was a saint! Get out!"
The Series Has Landed,Farnsworth," Dear Lord, Bender, you're filthy."
The Series Has Landed,Bender," Yeah, like you don't have crap in your neck!"
The Series Has Landed,Farnsworth," Amy, why don't you give his body a going over with the cleaning pick?"
The Series Has Landed,Amy, OK. Does it hurt when I go like this?
The Series Has Landed,Leela, Ow!
The Series Has Landed,Bender, A little.
The Series Has Landed,Fry," Well, the doctor says I'm as healthy as a crab. Can I go into space now?"
The Series Has Landed,Farnsworth," As soon as we finish cleaning Bender. Oh, and Fry, this is our intern, Amy Wong. She's an engineering student of mine. [whispering] I like having her around because she's the same blood type as me."
The Series Has Landed,Amy," Hey! You're the unfrozen guy! From the 20th century, right?"
The Series Has Landed,Fry, [chuffed] Last time I checked.
The Series Has Landed,Leela, Hang on. Amy Wong? Of the Mars Wongs?
The Series Has Landed,Amy," Look, we're not as rich as everybody says."
The Series Has Landed,Leela, Uh-huh! What sorority do you belong to?
The Series Has Landed,Amy, [ashamed] Kappa Kappa Wong.
The Series Has Landed,Bender," Hey, rich girl. Look over here! It's me, Bender. I'm being entertaining. [His body reaches into Amy's back pocket, takes out her wallet and empties the money into his neck.] [singing] Look at my head. It's all painted! Look at my head! I got a big, old head, hey! Ho! [His body replaces the wallet and signals an all clear] [talking] Alright, show's over, I'm tired."
The Series Has Landed,Farnsworth," Ah, to be young again. And also a robot. Now, as I recall, you youngsters have a package to deliver."
The Series Has Landed,Fry," Finally! Come on, Bender. Let's mosey!"
The Series Has Landed,Bender," Nice catch, idiot!"
The Series Has Landed,Fry, So where are we going anyway?
The Series Has Landed,Leela, Nowhere special. The moon.
The Series Has Landed,Fry, The moon? The moon moon? Wow! I'm gonna be a famous hero just like Neil Armstrong and those other brave guys no one ever heard of!
The Series Has Landed,Amy," Oh, I love stuff like the moon! Can I come, Leela?"
The Series Has Landed,Leela, Well ... I guess so. Just be careful. I'd like to hold off any major screw-ups until at least my second day as captain.
The Series Has Landed,Farnsworth," Nothing will go wrong. [He leans over to Leela.] [whispering] If something goes wrong, bring back the blood."
The Series Has Landed,Fry, Can I do the countdown?
The Series Has Landed,Leela," Huh? Oh, sure. Knock yourself out."
The Series Has Landed,Fry," Ten ... [The ship takes off, clears the atmosphere and approaches the moon.] ... nine--"
The Series Has Landed,Leela," OK, we're here!"
The Series Has Landed,Fry, [awestruck] Eightsevensixfivefourthreetwooneblastoff!
The Series Has Landed,Fry, Hurry up! I wanna see the moon!
The Series Has Landed,Leela, Relax. It's open till 9.
The Series Has Landed,Fry, That's one small step for Fry--
The Series Has Landed,Man, And one giant line for admission!
The Series Has Landed,Fry," Wow! [He turns to the man.] Um, can I have cuts?"
The Series Has Landed,Man, Hmm ... no!
The Series Has Landed,Fry, You're not gonna believe this but they landed an amusement park on the moon!
The Series Has Landed,Amy, Guh! It's the happiest place orbiting Earth.
The Series Has Landed,Fry," Let's go, already!"
The Series Has Landed,Leela," Fry, we have a crate to deliver."
The Series Has Landed,Fry, Let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
The Series Has Landed,Bender, Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
The Series Has Landed,Leela," OK, if everyone's finished being stupid--"
The Series Has Landed,Fry, I had more but you go ahead.
The Series Has Landed,Leela, We'll deliver that crate like professionals and then we'll go home.
The Series Has Landed,Fry, But I've never been to the moon before.
The Series Has Landed,Leela," Alright. We'll deliver that crate like professionals ... and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. [The other three high-five.] Amy, why don't you help Fry hoist down the crate. Then lock up when you're done. Just be careful."
The Series Has Landed,Amy," Aye, aye, Captain! I mean only one eye. I mean, yes, sir-- Um, ma'am!"
The Series Has Landed,Amy, Clear?
The Series Has Landed,Fry, Clear!
The Series Has Landed,Amy, Ready to hoist?
The Series Has Landed,Fry, Ready!
The Series Has Landed,Amy, Ow!
The Series Has Landed,Fry, My first space delivery.
The Series Has Landed,Fry," Uh, greetings, Moon Man. We come in peace. I am Fry from the planet Earth."
The Series Has Landed,Sal," Wise guy, huh? If I wasn't so lazy I'd punch you in the stomach."
The Series Has Landed,Fry," But you are lazy, right?"
The Series Has Landed,Sal," Oh, don't get me started."
The Series Has Landed,Craterface," Hi, I'm Craterface! Welcome to Luna Park. I'll have to confiscate your alcohol, sir."
The Series Has Landed,Bender, Better mascots than you have tried.
The Series Has Landed,Craterface, At least I still have my self respect!
The Series Has Landed,Leela, Who buys this trash?
The Series Has Landed,Bender, Idiots who need gifts for other idiots.
The Series Has Landed,Fry," Hey, I got you guys refrigerator magnets."
The Series Has Landed,Bender," Get it off! Get it off! Get it-- Uh-oh! [He starts singing his own version of Bob Dylan's ""Blowin' in the Wind"".] [singing] How many roads must a man walk down, before you-- [He howls. Fry takes the magnet off and Bender gasps.] [talking] Keep those things off of me! Magnets screw up my inhibition unit!"
The Series Has Landed,Fry, So you flip out and start acting like some crazy folk singer?
The Series Has Landed,Bender, Yes. I guess a robot would have to be crazy to wanna be a folk singer.
The Series Has Landed,Whalerbots," [singing] We're whalers on the moon,"
The Series Has Landed,"We carry a harpoon,",
The Series Has Landed,"But there ain't no whales,",
The Series Has Landed,"So we tell our tall tale,",
The Series Has Landed,And sing our whaling tune!,
The Series Has Landed,Whalerbot," Bender, hey, Bender! Over here!"
The Series Has Landed,Bender," Oh, jeez! I went to high school with that guy!"
The Series Has Landed,Announcer, Monsanto presents  The Goophy Gopher Revue!
The Series Has Landed,Gopher #1, Why does a moon rock taste better than an Earth rock?
The Series Has Landed,Gopher #2, Because it's a little meteor!
The Series Has Landed,Fry, This is weak!
The Series Has Landed,Gopher #1, Address all complaints to the Monsanto corporation.
The Series Has Landed,Leela," What's wrong, Fry?"
The Series Has Landed,Fry," I don't know. This place is great and all but its just so artificial. The gravity, the air, the gophers. You might as well stay on Earth. [He tosses his candy floss into a bin and runs to a window.] That's what I came to see! I wanna go out there and jump around like an astronaut. Screw this phoney stuff!"
The Series Has Landed,Leela, But the phoney stuff is what's fun. It's boring out there.
The Series Has Landed,Bender, Yeah! You're the kind of guy who visits Jerusalem and doesn't want to see the Sexeteria!
The Series Has Landed,Leela, Maybe I should take Fry on the Luna Rover ride. You get to wear a space suit and drive around on the surface. And the line's short because it's educational.
The Series Has Landed,Fry, I don't care how educational it is. Let's do it!
The Series Has Landed,Bender, [shouting] Next year in Jerusalem!
The Series Has Landed,Fry, Finally! Get ready for some serious moon action.
The Series Has Landed,Narrator, [on loudspeaker] The story of lunar exploration started with one man. A man with a dream.
The Series Has Landed,Ralph Kramden-bot," One of these days, Alice. Bang! Zoom! Straight to the moon!"
The Series Has Landed,Leela," Wow, I never realised the first astronauts were so fat!"
The Series Has Landed,Fry," That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian. And he was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife."
The Series Has Landed,Amy, Wow! I could swear I was really playing virtual skeeball! [Bender taps her on the shoulder.] Hm?
The Series Has Landed,Bender," Look, it's that crate we were gonna throw in the sewer."
The Series Has Landed,Amy, The keys to the ship! [She pats her pockets.] They must have fallen into the crate! Leela's gonna kill me!
The Series Has Landed,Bender, Nah. She'll probably make me do it.
The Series Has Landed,Amy, Mister? Could you please get those keys out for me?
The Series Has Landed,Sal, What do I look like? A guy who's not lazy?
The Series Has Landed,Narrator," [on loudspeaker] No one knows where, when or how Man first landed on the moon."
The Series Has Landed,Fry, I do.
The Series Has Landed,Narrator, [on loudspeaker] But our fun-gineers think it might have happened something like this 
The Series Has Landed,Whalerbots," [singing] We're whalers on the moon,"
The Series Has Landed,Gophers," [singing] We carry a harpoon,"
The Series Has Landed,Whalerbots, and  [singing] But there ain't no whales so we tell a tall tale...
The Series Has Landed,Leela, [singing] And sing a whaling tune. We're whalers on the moon--
The Series Has Landed,Fry, That's not how it happened.
The Series Has Landed,Leela," Oh, really? I don't see you with a fun-gineering degree!"
The Series Has Landed,Fry, This is stupid. I'm taking this thing out to the real moon.
The Series Has Landed,Leela," Fry, no. This is my first mission and I'm not gonna let us get in any trouble. Besides, the car's on a track."
The Series Has Landed,Fry, Not for long!
The Series Has Landed,Whalerbot, Ooh! Ah! I died doin' what I loved.
The Series Has Landed,Leela," OK, you're on the surface. Now I'll give you 10 minutes. Then you'll get bored, turn around and apologise for being such a jerk. Agreed?"
The Series Has Landed,Fry," Agreed. [He drives over craters and flies through the air, cheering.] Yeah! Crank up the radio!"
The Series Has Landed,Whalerbots, [singing; on radio] We're whalers on the--
The Series Has Landed,Fry, Yee-haw!
The Series Has Landed,Leela, Time's up. Make a U-turn at the next crater.
The Series Has Landed,Fry," No, not yet. How 'bout we go look for the original moon landing site?"
The Series Has Landed,Leela, That's crazy! It's been lost for centuries!
The Series Has Landed,Fry, Well I'm feelin' lucky! [The car suddenly falls into a huge crater and starts to sink at the bottom.] Uh ... I'm ready to go back now.
The Series Has Landed,Fry," We're gonna die! It's every man for himself! [He jumps off the car and starts to sink.] Help me, Leela! [Leela grabs Fry and an oxygen canister and flies out of the crater.] You did it! We're safe!"
The Series Has Landed,Leela, No. Now we're gonna die.
The Series Has Landed,Fry, It's every man for himself.
The Series Has Landed,Bender," Hey, look what I won from a tourist's pocket!"
The Series Has Landed,Amy, Shut up. You're distracting me.
The Series Has Landed,Bender," Come on, it's just like making love. Y'know  Left, down, rotate 62 degrees, engage rotor."
The Series Has Landed,Amy, I know how to make love!
The Series Has Landed,Bender," Here, let me do it. [He puts his hand up the chute and grabs the keys but then drops them.] Ah, lousy arm. Must be rigged! [Moon Patrol officers walk up behind him.] That's her, officers! [He points at Amy.] Uh, that's the woman who programmed me for evil!"
The Series Has Landed,Bender," Yeah, well, I'm gonna go build my own theme park, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the park!"
The Series Has Landed,Fry," [gasping] I'm sorry, Leela, I can't go on any further. Just leave me to die in that barn over there."
The Series Has Landed,Leela, Thank God!
The Series Has Landed,Hydroponic Farmer," Trespassers, eh?"
The Series Has Landed,Fry," No, sir. We're amusement park patrons."
The Series Has Landed,Farmer," Ooh, that's a wicked sinful place. Tilt-a-whirl's OK, but the rest is mighty wicked."
The Series Has Landed,Leela, Our car broke down and we're out of oxygen. Can we borrow some?
The Series Has Landed,Farmer," Huh, borry? Looky here, city girl, oxygen don't grow on trees. You'll have to earn it doing chores on my hydroponic farm. You can go back to your precious theme park at sun up."
The Series Has Landed,Fry, I guess we could do chores for a few hours.
The Series Has Landed,Leela," Fry, night lasts two weeks on the moon."
The Series Has Landed,Farmer, Yup. Drops down to -173!
The Series Has Landed,Fry, Fahrenheit or Celsius?
The Series Has Landed,Farmer," First one, then th'other. And them spacesuits ain't a-heated so you ain't goin' nowhere till sunrise. You can sleep in the barn. Just don't be a-touchin' my three beautiful robot daughters. Y'hear?"
The Series Has Landed,Fry, Robot daughters?
The Series Has Landed,Farmer, This here is Lulabelle 7.
The Series Has Landed,Lulabelle 7, Yoo-hoo!
The Series Has Landed,Farmer, Daisy-Mae 128K.
The Series Has Landed,Daisy-Mae 128K, Yoo-hoo!
The Series Has Landed,Farmer, And the Crushinator.
The Series Has Landed,Crushinator, [mechanical voice] Yoo-hoo.
The Series Has Landed,Fry, Whoa!
The Series Has Landed,Leela," I told you to turn around and go back to the park. But oh, no, the park was too phoney. We had to see the real moon."
The Series Has Landed,Fry, And it was great! We got to see craters and rocks and that one incredible rock that looked like a crater and ... and these fellas.
The Series Has Landed,Leela," Fry, face it  The moon is a dump. It's a boring, dried-up wasteland and the only reason anybody ever comes here is for the tacky little amusement park. Can't you just accept that?"
The Series Has Landed,Fry, I guess I can't.
The Series Has Landed,Farmer, I'll learn ye to sleep with my robot daughters!
The Series Has Landed,Bender, He'll never find me in here.
The Series Has Landed,Leela, Bender?
The Series Has Landed,Fry," Oh, Bender. You didn't touch the Crushinator, did you?"
The Series Has Landed,Bender, Of course not. A lady that fine you gotta romance first.
The Series Has Landed,Farmer," Oh, no you don't! C'mere, Crushinator."
The Series Has Landed,Crushinator," [mechanical voice] Yes, Pa."
The Series Has Landed,Fry, It's too low.
The Series Has Landed,Leela, Hang on. Hang on. Jump! [The trio jump over the bridge and the buggy drives under it. They land back in the car. The Crushinator slams into it and cuts her way through. They come to a gorge.] Hold on to your helmet!
The Series Has Landed,Farmer," God darn it, Crushinator, jump!"
The Series Has Landed,Crushinator," [mechanical voice] No, Pa. I love him."
The Series Has Landed,Fry," Hey, cool! Dark side of the moon!"
The Series Has Landed,Leela," Nightfall's coming. [The shadow falls over Fry and he starts to shiver.] Hurry, before we freeze."
The Series Has Landed,Bender," What do you mean ""we"", mammal?"
The Series Has Landed,Farnsworth," Oh, dear! I really ought to do something. But I am already in my pyjamas."
The Series Has Landed,Leela, We can't outrun it forever.
The Series Has Landed,Fry, Over there! Look! It's the moon landing site! We found it!
The Series Has Landed,Leela," Quick, get in."
The Series Has Landed,Fry," It's that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong's footprint! [He stamps over it.] Hey! My foot's bigger! Leela, isn't this the greatest thing you've ever seen?"
The Series Has Landed,Leela," Fry, look around. It's just a crummy plastic flag and a dead man's tracks in the dust. [The shadow creeps over Fry and his smile fades.] Now get in here before you freeze."
The Series Has Landed,Bender," Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar lander and the blackjack. Ah, screw the whole thing."
The Series Has Landed,Leela, Well if the oxygen holds out we might live long enough to starve to death.
The Series Has Landed,Fry," Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should have dragged you out here."
The Series Has Landed,Leela," That's right, you shouldn't have. I still don't get what the big attraction is."
The Series Has Landed,Fry, I never told anybody this but a thousand years ago I used to look up at the moon and dream about being an astronaut. I just didn't have the grades. Nor the physical endurance. Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me.
The Series Has Landed,Leela, A week would be a little much.
The Series Has Landed,Fry," The moon was like this awesome, romantic, mysterious thing, hanging up there in the sky where you could never reach it, no matter how much you wanted to. [Leela's cold glance becomes a sympathetic frown.] But you're right. Once you're actually here it's just a big dull rock. I guess I just wanted you to see it through my eyes, the way I used to."
The Series Has Landed,Leela," Fry, look. [Fry and Leela gaze at a stunning Earthrise]. It really is beautiful. I don't know why I never noticed before."
The Series Has Landed,Farmer," Had to come back for the Crushinator, eh, robot? Well I got you this time."
The Series Has Landed,Fry, It's Amy! We're saved!
The Series Has Landed,Leela, Amy? Where'd she learn to operate the controls like that?
The Series Has Landed,Bender, Not the magnet! No! No! No-- [The winch grabs him.] Uh-oh!
The Series Has Landed,Bender," [singing] She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes,"
The Series Has Landed,She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes--,
The Series Has Landed,[talking] I'll kill you Amy!,
The Series Has Landed,"[singing] She'll be comin' round the mountain,",
The Series Has Landed,"She'll be comin' round the mountain,",
The Series Has Landed,She'll be comin'--,
The Series Has Landed,Farmer," Aw, dang it!"
The Series Has Landed,Bender," [singing] She'll be riding six white horses when she comes,"
The Series Has Landed,She'll be riding six white horses when she comes--,
The Series Has Landed,"[talking] Hey, I'm pretty good!",
The Series Has Landed,[singing] She'll be riding six white horses...,
The Series Has Landed,Leela," [from lander] So, Fry, was the real moon anything like the moon you used to dream about?"
The Series Has Landed,Fry, [from lander] Well ... close enough!
The Series Has Landed,Bender," [singing; over credits] Well I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,"
The Series Has Landed,"Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,",
The Series Has Landed,"Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun,",
The Series Has Landed,"Oh, I'll shoot her with my ray gun,",
The Series Has Landed,"Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,",
The Series Has Landed,When she comes!,
The Series Has Landed,"I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world,",
The Series Has Landed,"I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world, ",
The Series Has Landed,"I'll be blastin' all the humans, ",
The Series Has Landed,"I'll be blastin' all the humans, ",
The Series Has Landed,"I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world,",
The Series Has Landed,In the world!,
The Series Has Landed,[shouting] One more time!,
The Series Has Landed,,
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Lincoln, [on TV] Four score and 1145 years ago our forefathers' foreheads conceived a new nation.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Washington, [on TV] And this Presidents' Day we honoureth those values that my body fought and died for.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Malfunctioning Eddie," [on TV] Values like this brand new Plymouth V'Ger! Hi, I'm Malfunctioning Eddie and I'm malfunctioning so badly I'm practically giving these cars away!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," Hey, let's go car shopping! My parents promised if I got all B's they'd buy me a bar, and I got all C's!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender, Mind if I tag along? I gotta bring my ass in for servicing. [He picks up a recall notice.] The recall notice says it could burst into flames in a low-speed collision.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, No wonder you've been staying at the back of conga lines lately.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela," I'll get my coat. Let's go, Bender."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Victor," Hello, I am Victor and I know many things about the art of unloading fine cars on beautiful women."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela, Uh-huh. Now tell us she's witty and sophisticated.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Victor," Ah-ah-ah! A gentleman always sells a lady a car first. [He takes Amy over to a car.] This is the Beta Romeo. Yes, the Beta Romeo. Note the cross-your-heart seat belt which protects, lifts and separates."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Thundercougarfalconbird salesman," Spotted her the minute you walked in, didn't you, sir? She's a real beauty."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Yup, she's beautiful coffee alright."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Salesman," No, the Ford Thundercougarfalconbird! [He takes Fry over to a car.] Nothing makes you feel more like a man than a Thundercougarfalconbird. So how much were you thinking of spending on this Thundercougarfalconbird?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Sorry, I'm not here to buy."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Salesman," I understand, and it's wonderful you don't care whether anyone questions your sexual orientation."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, I care! I care plenty! I just don't know how to make them stop!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Salesman, One word  Thundercougarfalconbird!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Victor," The luxurious seats are stuffed with eagle down and the dashboard inlaid with the beaks of a thousand eagles. Also, there are some eagles under the floorboards."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, That's an awful lot of eagle.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Victor," Yes, and yet--"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, What's wrong?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Victor, It is just ... the luxury edition has so much more eagle. It saddens me to think of you missing out.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," Oh, don't be sad. My parents are paying and they're incredibly rich."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Mechanic, I installed shock-absorbing bumpers to reduce the risk of catastrophic butt failure.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender," You, sir, have defaced a national treasure! I demand you restore my buttocks to their former glory."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Mechanic," Alright. But sooner or later that ass is gonna blow, and when it does, I just pray you're not moonin' someone you care about."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," Smeesh, Leela! This car has everything a beautiful woman like me needs. Victor said so."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Victor, [quietly; to himself] No dog food for Victor tonight.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela," OK, the sticker says 55,000, but we'll only go as high as, say--"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," 60,000!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Victor," Oh, I will have to ask my manager."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela," Amy, you don't go up from the sticker price."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, I thought it was an auction.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Victor, He is not too happy.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," I'm sorry. 80,000?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, Uh-oh. I'm terrible at parallel parking.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Hermes, [from inside] And now you're asking for a day off? Get out of my and my sight! [Fry and Leela look at each other and shrug.] You're bogarting my patience.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela," Hermes, who were you yelling at?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Hermes," Myself. I asked myself a Valentine's Day off, but I was in no mood for any of my shenanigans."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Valentine's Day's coming? Oh, crap! I forgot to get a girlfriend again. Well, since neither of us has a date, why don't we...?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela, You just assume I can't get a Valentine's date?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, Shall we say eight o'clock?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," Hey, I'm taking my new car out for a spin to Mercury. Anybody wanna come?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Yeah, OK. What's the weather like?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," The usual  Boiling lead, oceans of lava."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," So, what? Shorts?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Boy, this A.C. is incredible! [He shivers.] I'd better turn on the heater too. [He does and the fuel gauge starts to go down. They pass Hg's Fuel, the only fuel station on the planet.] [shouting] Boy, this heater is incredible! I'd better turn up the A.C. some more."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," [shouting] Hey, how about some icy margaritas?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, [shouting] Yeah! [He pushes a button and two glasses and a mixer comes out. The fuel gauge drops further.] We're slowing down!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, [shouting] Don't worry. I'll hit the fuel guzzler!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," [shouting] Who wants pop-tarts? [He puts the pop-tarts in the toaster and turns it on full. The engine stops, the heater and A.C. go off, the mixer stops and the car jerks to a halt, then falls to the ground. Amy gasps and sees the fuel gauge is empty. Fry takes his shades off and sees the sign to Hg's Fuel; 4750 miles one way, 4750 miles the other way.] Uh-oh!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," It's OK, I have an emergency phone."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, What are you doing?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, Spluh! It's a video-phone. [She presses a button on the steering wheel and a screen and dialling pad fold out. She dials.] Lucky I'm a member of the Astro-Afro-Antarctico-Amer-Asian Auto Association. [A man appears on the screen.] Hello? Septuple-A?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, Phew!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," It'll be a couple hours. Oh, I'm gonna get sweat on my sweat-suit."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Hey, tell me something  You've got all this money, how come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, I guess 'cause my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. [She scoffs.] As though!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the Pope?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," Yeah, and if you were the Pope they'd be all, ""Straighten your Pope hat,"" and, ""Put on your good vestments."" [Fry laughs then Amy joins in.] You know, Fry, it's nice to find someone I can talk to about stuff, and junk."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Yeah, it's like we feel the same way about junk and stuff, or, whatever."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," So while they're towin' us, you wanna do it?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, Yeah.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Hermes," Which concludes the summary of the movie I saw last night. Now, any old business?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,All, [simultaneous] No.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Hermes, Any new business?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,All, [simultaneous] No.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Hermes, Anyone spend the night together?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, Yep.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, Kind of.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender, What?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Hermes," Oh, my God!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, We ran out of fuel on Mercury and one thing led to another.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, And it led there again when we got home.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender," Congratulations, Fry, you snagged the perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich, she's probably got other characteristics."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela, Bender! Romance isn't about money.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender," Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg here is desperately poor and miserably lonely? Puh-lease!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela," For your information, it's because he's hideous."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Hermes, Well I think Amy and Fry go together like a lime and coconut.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Farnsworth, Do I hear wedding bells?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, What? No!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Farnsworth," Really? Oh, dear."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zoidberg, You're both very lucky. I'd pay anything to end my miserable loneliness. If only I weren't so desperately poor.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender, Wait. You mean people will pay good money for romance? Hmm. I think I have a scheme so deviously clever that I--
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Judge, $500 and time served.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender," Stupid anti-pimping laws! [He turns to Leela.] Well, pay the man!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Hookerbot," Bender, honey, we love you!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender," Shut up, baby, I know it!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender," Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping but you rarely have to use the phrase ""upside your head""."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela," Bender, this is stupid. Why would anyone come to you for romantic help?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender, Hey! Don't make me go upside your head!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Hermes, [shouting] Fry! Amy! Put your pants back on! I need a stapler.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zoidberg, Stop! Stop! If you interrupt the mating dance the male will become enraged and maul us with his fearsome gonad.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," [whispering] It's working, they think we're making out. [They laugh then juggle.] Wait, why aren't we making out?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, I 'unno.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender," OK, Mister...?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zapp," Uh, Smith! Zapp Smith. Uh, Brannigan."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender, Just check off the things you're looking for in a love partner.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zapp," Let's see ... Oh, yes! [He punches out a hole.] Yes, definitely. [He punches out another.] Oh, I'd like some of that. [Another one.] Mmm, I'll just have everything on the menu."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender, Now to run it through our high-speed romance-a-logical data-fier. [He screws up the sheet and throws it in his chest cabinet and imitates a computer by beeping. He then pulls out a random sheet and hands it to Zapp.] Say hello to Miss Right!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zapp, [sexfully] Hello!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, Wow! We're great kissers!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," Yeah! Hey, later, you wanna drive out to Europa? We could have a picnic and spit watermelon seeds at Jupiter."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Hey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back in the 20th century. Ah, it's cool how we sort of think exactly alike, and junk."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," Yeah. Y'know, Fry, I really like hanging out with you."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Everything was going great. Then, all of a sudden, she's talking about hanging out. Hanging out? She's getting way too serious. I'm not a one woman man, Leela."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela, You'll be back to zero soon enough.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, Don't you get it? She's smothering me.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, Hi.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, You see? You see? Now she's bothering me when I'm at work.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela, Fry--
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," I'm doing my job, there's Amy; I spend a few hours selecting a candy from the machine, there's Amy; I wake up the morning after sleeping with Amy, there's Amy!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela, I think you're over reacting.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Am I? [shouting] Am I? [talking] Face it, I'm a prize catch. [He belches.] I mean, I'm pulling down delivery boy money."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela," Fry, she's pulling down billionaire trust-fund money."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Then she wants me as a trophy husband. Leela, you gotta come to Europa with us. I can't be alone with her."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," So, ready for a secluded picnic with just you and me?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Hey, you know who loves secluded picnics with just you and me? [He looks over Amy's shoulder at Leela. She shakes her head.] Uh, Dr. Zoidberg."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zoidberg, Did someone say something about a free hot meal?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zoidberg," Mmm, I haven't eaten since Tuesday! Bird eggs, animal slices ... [He gobbles down the food.] ... dry woven reeds! [He eats the basket.] All gone! Can I drive?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," No. So, Fry, you busy tomorrow? I got two tickets to the big ape fight."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Jeez, we're already planning to spend Valentine's Day together. Isn't that enough?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," OK, sure. What do you wanna do for Valentine's Day?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Oh, so all of a sudden we're spending Valentine's Day together?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, But you just said--
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," That's it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, you drive."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zoidberg, Wahoo!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," [from inside] Pardon me, excuse me."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zoidberg," Ah, I'll just turn the wheel to maximum fastness!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Amy, you know how at first you like chocolate but then you start to get tired of it because it always wants to hang out with you?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, Huh? You don't like chocolate?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Look, could chocolate just let me finish?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zoidberg," Vroom, vroom! And the winner of the big car race is ... Hot Rod Zoidberg!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Amy, what I'm trying to say is, I think maybe you and I should stop--"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zoidberg," Uh-oh. Here, you drive!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zoidberg, Fry? Are you alright?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, Ow! My head is killing me. What happened? Was anybody hurt?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zoidberg," No, no, no, no, no, of course not. Nobody but you. I'm afraid your body was badly damaged in the crash."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, How badly?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zoidberg," That's it over there. [He points to Fry's headless body. Fry screams.] Don't worry, I managed to keep your head alive with some quick surgery."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, Where is it?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zoidberg, There.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," Looks like we'll be spending a lot more time together, Fry!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela, This sort of thing always happens with office romances.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zoidberg," Don't worry, Fry, we'll have your body all fixed up in a few days. [He lifts Fry's body up over his shoulder.] Upsy daisy!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Well, Amy, I'll try not to interfere with your life too much."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, Fry!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Ooh, sorry. I guess I control that arm."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," So, what was it you wanted to talk about before we crashed anyway?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Oh, that. [He turns and sees Farnsworth sweeping behind them.] Maybe we'd better talk in private. [whispering] I'll meet you in the closet."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Amy, I really like you, as a friend. But I think we're spending too much time together."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, You're breaking up with me?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, I just think we should start seeing other people.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," But, I was really having fun. [She sighs.] If that's how you feel."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," I'm sorry, but it is."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," Well, whatever. Hey, listen, as long as we're not seeing each other, you mind if I ask someone else out for Valentine's Day?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, Huh?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," I mean, unless it would make you feel bad, being a third wheel."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Hey, I can get a date too. Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of women!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, With my body I think you might only attract one sort of woman.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, [happy] Oh! [disappointed] Oh!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela," So, how's business?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender," Are you familiar with my friend Al Gore? I'm tellin' you, losers get really desperate around Valentine's Day."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela," Yeah, it's pathetic alright! [She whistles. Bender hums.] How much?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender, 500 bucks.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela, Done.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender, Zapp Brannigan OK?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela, No!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender, 600.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you for a minute? [He turns to Amy.] In private?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," Oh, no problem."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's plans with some goon and I'm gonna be stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will you be my date, please?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela," You're too late, Fry. I'm sharing Valentine's Day with a very special man. He's not Zapp Brannigan or anything!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, Then I have no choice but to do something so pitiful and embarrassing that I'm ashamed to tell you about it.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela, Bender's in his office.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, Thanks.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender," I got your hook-up, Fry. Now, my usual fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as how it's you, I'll need it in advance."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," OK, Fry, we're done putting on the bra."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway? Are you expecting something to happen with your Valentine's date?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, What business is it of yours?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, And another thing  You're using an awful lot of make-up there.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, This is deodorant.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, What does it do?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," [shouting] C'mon in, Gary! I'll just be another 20 minutes."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Gary, [from outside] I'll be waiting.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, 20 minutes? You're practically ready now!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," Yeah, but it's good to make them wait a little."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Oh, God, it's true!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Gary, That dress looks great on you.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, [simultaneous] Thanks.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, [simultaneous] Thanks. [He watches the door.] Where is she?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Gary," I must say, Amy, you're all made up, just like Fry's date. Get it?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, Mm-mm.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, I've got a date. She'll be along any minute.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender," Fry, look who I found! It's Petunia, your dream girl!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Petunia, How's them eats?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, Uh--
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Petunia, Don't mind if I do. [She puts the hamburger into her handbag.] Kids'll be hungry.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, [whispering] She seems a little old for me.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender, She is well-travelled. And I don't mean she travels a lot!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Petunia, Wheels fell off my house.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender, Now how about a rose for the lady? Five bucks a pop!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Gary, I'll take one.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Oh, yeah? Well I want one too."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender, Eight bucks.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, But you just said--
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender, Demand suddenly skyrocketed. You all saw it!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender," Leela, meet your future husband Sal."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Sal," Nice eyeball, eyeball."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela," Nice ass, ass."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender," Ooh, sparks! [whispering] Buy her a rose, I guarantee she'll put out!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Sal," Eh, I'll take my chances."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zapp, Cheers!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,"""Woman""", Cheers!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Petunia, So tell me about your prospects. You a good gambler?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Well, ma'am, I--"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Petunia, What's your game? Bingo? Keno? Wait a minute! You don't have your own body.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," No, but I control this arm."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Petunia," Slots player, huh? Sorry, but I think I can do better."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Wait, come back, uh, darling."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Petunia," Can't, hon', I gotta catch my bus back to Nutley. I'd kiss you goodnight but I lost my teeth pulling out a stump."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Sal," So anyways, Leela, I'd love to take a whack at ya but that 10 15 to Nutley ain't goin' nowheres without yours truly behinds the wheel."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Petunia," Excuse me, did you say ""10 15 to Nutley""?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Sal," Why, yes I dids."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela, [whispering] Bender! Did you just round up our dates at the bus station?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender, Of course not.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Sal, [shouting] Anybodys else for Nutley?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zapp," Baby, wait! You didn't show me your surprise."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Gary, [whispering] You know what I'd like to do...?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Oh, jeez, get a room!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Gary, Maybe later.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Hey, I have an idea  Let's all go out for ice cream."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Gary," Actually, I thought Amy might like to come back to my place for coffee."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, I don't really like coffee.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Gary, Neither do I.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," Ooh, I feel a little tipsy!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Gary, Let me pick up the check.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, Nooo! [Gary drops his card onto the check.] That's it I'm gettin' the hell outta here. [He tugs at his head.] Ooh! Ow!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela," Why, if it isn't my favourite head on Amy's body  Fry."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Oh, Leela!"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy, We were just on our way out.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela," Nonsense, the evening's young. So, Gary, what do you do for a living?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Gary, I'm a banking industry regulator.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela," Really? Y'know, I heard that banking industry regulations are really very simple."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Gary," Oh, no, that's not true. You see, modern banking regulations are a product of five different regulatory traditions. Six if you wanna get technical."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela," Oh, I do."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Gary, It all began in 1410 when a number of noblemen convened...
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, [whispering] Thank you.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zoidberg," There you are, good as new. Except for your dorsal fin. I'm afraid I couldn't find it after the crash."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, Can I live without it?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Zoidberg, If you call that living.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Farnsworth, I still don't understand why you wouldn't let me graft a laser cannon onto your chest. To crush those who disobey you. [He sighs.] But I guess we're just two different people.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And I hope there are no hard feelings about your date, or stuff."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Amy," It's OK, I had fun. And if I ever feel lonely I can just look over at this disfiguring scar and think of you."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own body back."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela, So how's the old corpse? Everything hooked up OK?
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry," Seems to be. My neck's just a little tender. [He touches his neck and kicks himself.] Ow! Cool! [He does it again.] Ow! Listen, Leela. Thanks for rescuing me last night."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela, Anytime. I actually enjoyed hanging out with you.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender," Yep, everything worked out great thanks to good old Bender."
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela, Come on! It's not like you intentionally set us up with bad dates so we'd spend Valentine's Day together.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender," Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela, No! You didn't! You just corralled a bunch of stiffs at the bus station and pocketed our money!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender," True. But in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?"
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Leela, Yeah.
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Fry, I guess so. [Bender laughs and puts his arms around Fry and Leela and pats them.] Watch the neck! Watch the neck!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,Bender, My ass! My beautiful ass!
Put Your Head on My Shoulders,,
Raging Bender,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. I've taught the toaster to feel love. [The toaster bounds across the table, barking like a dog and licks Bender. He knocks it away and it hits the wall. Toast springs out of it.] And Hermes returns from his vacation today."
Raging Bender,Hermes," [monotonous] Good morning, people."
Raging Bender,Fry," Hey, Hermes!"
Raging Bender,Zoidberg, Hello!
Raging Bender,Leela, Good to see you.
Raging Bender,Farnsworth, Yo!
Raging Bender,Bender, My man!
Raging Bender,Amy, So how was the Spleef Nebula?
Raging Bender,Hermes, [monotonous] The flight had a stopover on the Brain Slug Planet. Hermes liked it so much he decided to stay of his own free will.
Raging Bender,Fry, Hermes has all the fun. Wait a second! He's got a Brain Slug on his head!
Raging Bender,Leela, [whispering] Shh! You're gonna get us all assimilated!
Raging Bender,Amy, [whispering] Just act normal and switch to a garlic shampoo.
Raging Bender,Hermes, [monotonous] On to new business. Today's mission is for all of you to go to the Brain Slug Planet.
Raging Bender,Zoidberg, What are we going to do there?
Raging Bender,Hermes, [monotonous] Just walk around not wearing a helmet.
Raging Bender,Farnsworth," Sounds great, Hermes! Whatever you say. [He nods and then leans in to the others.] [whispering] Let's ditch him and go to the movies!"
Raging Bender,Fry," Hey, yeah!"
Raging Bender,Zoidberg, I'm seeing a movie with friends!
Raging Bender,Fry, Cool! Let's see this one!
Raging Bender,Leela," Nah. I'm not in the mood for a historical documentary. I've heard good things about Quizblorg, Quizblorg."
Raging Bender,Amy, Guk! I hate subtitles. Alien films are so pretentious.
Raging Bender,Zoidberg, Fellows! Fellows! How about a film we can all enjoy? Planet Of The Clams. [He points to the films poster that parodies Planet Of The Apes except with Decapodians and bipedal clams riding bareback on horses.] It's about an upside-down world where lobster is slave to clam.
Raging Bender,Bender, Who invited you? Let's just see All My Circuits  The Movie.
Raging Bender,Fry," Yeah, I wanna see that."
Raging Bender,Bender," Good point, Bender."
Raging Bender,Fry, I'll take a small Slurm.
Raging Bender,Refreshment-bot," For only 25 cents less, you can get a super-small."
Raging Bender,Fry," Uh, OK. [The robot puts a tiny cup under the machine and it fills with a drip. Fry takes it and walks away. He trips and it spills onto his shirt.] Oh, man!"
Raging Bender,Bender," Hey, gimme a large diet malt liquor and a popcorn with extra motor oil."
Raging Bender,Farnsworth, Down in front!
Raging Bender,Announcer, [voice-over; on screen] Glagnar's Human Rinds presents  This Week In The Universe.
Raging Bender,Fry," [sarcastic] Ooh, this is real futuristic!"
Raging Bender,Crow T. Robot, Shh! Don't talk during the movie.
Raging Bender,Announcer," [voice-over; on screen] This week in the universe  New New York mayor C. Randall Poopenmeyer opens a new tube line to alleviate rush hour traffic. [In the movie, Poopenmeyer cuts a ribbon across a tube and the picture switches to people packed into another tube. The picture switches again to an alien army show.] Dateline  Paramecium Homeworld. Newly-crowned Miss Universe Gladice Lennox entertains troops fighting to wipe out the human race. [The soldiers cheer.] Go get 'em, boys! [The scene changes to a wrestling ring.] And in the world of Ultimate Robot Fighting, the Masked Unit wins his championship bout against Gorgeous Gonks by technical melting."
Raging Bender,Bender," [shouting] Go, Masked Unit! [A tall robot and a wide Fembot sit in front of him. The robot blocks his view.] Uh, hey, buddy! Yo! [He whistles.] You mind taking your head off?"
Raging Bender,Robot," I'm sorry, sir, but I need it to watch the movie."
Raging Bender,Bender, Just ask Flabby over here to describe it to you later.
Raging Bender,Robot," Sir, she is as the factory made her."
Raging Bender,Bender, Well they should have stopped making her about halfway through.
Raging Bender,Fembot, [in movie] Whee!
Raging Bender,Calculon," [in movie] Well, that finishes this paperwork. [The phone rings and he picks it up.] Calculon Enterprises."
Raging Bender,Monique," [on screen; in movie] Calculon, a fight scene has broken out at the special effects warehouse. Come quickly before a fiery explosion chases someone down a hallway."
Raging Bender,Calculon, [in movie] I have no choice but to--
Raging Bender,Mr. Moviefone," [voice-over; in movie] If you want Calculon to race to the laser gun battle in his hover-Ferarri, press 1. If you want Calculon to double-check his paperwork, press 2. Enter now."
Raging Bender,Mr. Moviefone, You have pressed 2.
Raging Bender,Fry," No, I didn't!"
Raging Bender,Mr. Moviefone, I'm almost positive you did.
Raging Bender,Calculon," [in movie] Add in the carryover from form 16A, then deduct line 2B..."
Raging Bender,Robot," Pardon me, sir, but you seem to be inadvertently kicking my seat."
Raging Bender,Bender," [mocking] ""Pardon me, sir, but you seem to be bleh, bleh..."""
Raging Bender,Robot," Yes, that's the gist of what I said. Would you mind?"
Raging Bender,Bender," Sure thing, pal."
Raging Bender,Robot," Uh, sir?"
Raging Bender,Bender, [fake shocked] Who threw that?
Raging Bender,Robot," That's it! Sir, I challenge you to fisticuffs!"
Raging Bender,Bender," Oh, I'm boned."
Raging Bender,Hattie, Let's all go to the lobby!
Raging Bender,Robot, I'm gonna open a file of whup-ass on you!
Raging Bender,Leela," Bender, do you know who that was?"
Raging Bender,Man #1, Cripes! The Masked Unit! You knocked him out cold.
Raging Bender,Man #2, I'm impressed.
Raging Bender,Doubledeal," Son, I'm the commissioner of Ultimate Robot Fighting. I'm a connoisseur of jerks like you who pick fights in movie theatres and you're the biggest I've ever seen."
Raging Bender,Bender, You should see me at funerals.
Raging Bender,Doubledeal," Kid, I want you in the Ultimate Robot Fighting League."
Raging Bender,Bender, Ultimate Robot Fighting? Sounds pleasant! I'll do it.
Raging Bender,Flabby, My hero!
Raging Bender,Farnsworth, Aw. They don't make movies like this anymore.
Raging Bender,Bender," I'm gonna be the greatest Ultimate Robot Fighter ever. Float like a floatbot, sting like an automatic stinging machine!"
Raging Bender,Amy," Bender, you can't be an Ultimate Robot Fighter. It's the most brutal form of competition in the galaxy!"
Raging Bender,Bender, It is?
Raging Bender,Farnsworth," There are no rules. Two robots enter, one robot leaves. Then later the other robot leaves after being declared the winner."
Raging Bender,Bender," Well, that doesn't sound so bad."
Raging Bender,Farnsworth," Oh, did I mention the crippling, agonising pain? I'm pretty sure I did. Oh, yes, definitely."
Raging Bender,Bender, Crippling pain? That's not covered by my insurance fraud! Count me out.
Raging Bender,Leela, No! You've got to do it. I don't care how suicidal it is.
Raging Bender,Fry, Hey! How come when I wanna do fun stuff that'll kill me you're against it?
Raging Bender,Leela," This is more important than that marble-eating contest, Fry! It's about pride. Let me tell you a story from my childhood."
Raging Bender,Zoidberg," Oh, again with the orphanarium!"
Raging Bender,Leela," When I was growing up at the orphanarium, I got picked on a lot."
Raging Bender,Leela, [voice-over] My only outlet was Arcturan Kung Fu.
Raging Bender,Fnog," Excellent. Bill, Keith, you will go to Junior Championships. Bill, congratulate Keith when he regains consciousness."
Raging Bender,Leela," But, Master Fnog, I can beat these dorks with one eye closed."
Raging Bender,Fnog, Perhaps. But there is more to winning than beating your opponent. You lack the will of the warrior.
Raging Bender,Leela, What do you mean? Watch this!
Raging Bender,Bill, [crying] Ow!
Raging Bender,Fnog," No girl has the will of a warrior. You have the will of a housewife or, at best, the schoolmarm."
Raging Bender,Leela, That's it. I'll take you on right now.
Raging Bender,Fnog," Very well. But, you see, I have the will of the warrior. Therefore, the battle is already over. The winner? Me! [He laughs.] Rematch? You lose again! Had enough? I thought so!"
Raging Bender,Leela, I lost my chance to be a champion. I won't let you throw away yours.
Raging Bender,Bender, Leela's right! I don't wanna end up a loser like her. Count me back in!
Raging Bender,Leela, Let's see what you got. Touch your toes.
Raging Bender,Bender, Still ... can't ... reach!
Raging Bender,Bender, Let's commence preparations for rumbling!
Raging Bender,Referee," Ladies and gentlemen and smizmars, welcome to tonight's main event. In this corner, from Mom's Friendly Robot Factory in America's heartland, Mexico  Bender! [Bender holds up an ""Applause"" sign and the crowd cheers.] And in this corner, from and made of Parts Unknown  The Clearcutter!"
Raging Bender,Fry, [shouting] Bender rules!
Raging Bender,Hermes, [monotonous] I got you an official Bender hat.
Raging Bender,Fry," Wow! Thanks, Hermes! [He raises it to his head.] I-- Hey! Cut that out!"
Raging Bender,Bender, You can't hit what you can't see!
Raging Bender,Leela," Get up, Bender. You can't quit every time you get an axe in the back. [The Clearcutter drags him away from her, drills something and slams him back down again. There is now a hole in Bender's head.] Or a drill through your face. Now quit scratching your axe-hole and get out there."
Raging Bender,Bender, Huh?
Raging Bender,Referee, And the winner is ... Bender!
Raging Bender,Doubledeal," Nice work out there, kid."
Raging Bender,Bender," Y'know, I think I he might be dead. I took a life!"
Raging Bender,Clearcutter," Hi, boss. Yo, dude!"
Raging Bender,Bender," Hey, he's not dead. What's up with that?"
Raging Bender,Doubledeal," What, you didn't read the pamphlet? Ultimate Robot Fighting's a scam, kid. It's rigged. [Bender gasps.] It's a secret, so keep it under your head, but the most popular robot always wins."
Raging Bender,Bender, You mean I'm not a great fighter? I just won 'cause I'm popular?
Raging Bender,Doubledeal, Bingo!
Raging Bender,Bender, Woo-hoo! I'm popular!
Raging Bender,Doubledeal," In fact, you're more than popular, you're pure lowest common denominator."
Raging Bender,Bender, Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
Raging Bender,Referee, Presenting Bender the Offender!
Raging Bender,Bender, I'm just an ex-con trying to go straight and get my kids back.
Raging Bender,Referee, Versus ... Billionairebot!
Raging Bender,Referee, Versus  The Foreigner!
Raging Bender,Foreigner, I'm not from here! I have my own customs! Look at my crazy passport!
Raging Bender,Referee, Versus ... The Chain Smoker!
Raging Bender,Chain Smoker, I love smoking. And after I win the fight I'm heading straight to your favourite restaurant.
Raging Bender,Bender," You know, I'm also an Ultimate Robot Lover."
Raging Bender,Leela, Bender! You're three hours late. You can't give up on your training now after both of us worked so hard.
Raging Bender,Bender," What do you mean, ""we""?"
Raging Bender,Leela," I said ""us""."
Raging Bender,Bender," Hey, Bender the Offender doesn't need you. Bender the Offender doesn't need anybody!"
Raging Bender,Fembot #1," What about us, Mr. The Offender?"
Raging Bender,Bender, Well obviously I need floozies! Let's roll!
Raging Bender,Bender," Howdy, chief. For my next bout, what do you say I fight these two bimbos in some mud?"
Raging Bender,Doubledeal," Actually, we've decided to go in a different direction."
Raging Bender,Bender, What if I told your we wouldn't be fighting in the conventional sense?
Raging Bender,Doubledeal," Bender, your popularity is slipping."
Raging Bender,Foreigner, Sales of your Bender Brand French milk bath soaps are down 20%.
Raging Bender,Bender," Those morons! I said pea berry, not sandalwood!"
Raging Bender,Doubledeal," Damnit, Bender! If you can't move sandalwood, you don't belong in this league! That's why you're gonna lose next week's title match."
Raging Bender,Bender, But the crowd loves me.
Raging Bender,Doubledeal, Perhaps. But let's see how they feel about your new persona  The Gender Bender.
Raging Bender,Billionairebot, You'll be the most unpopular robot fighter since Sergeant Faeces Processor.
Raging Bender,Bender," Oh, yeah? [He throws down the tutu.] Well what if I don't let the new guy win?"
Raging Bender,Doubledeal," Then he'll just have to beat you the old-fashioned way  To death! [He presses an intercom button.] Melissa, send in the new kid."
Raging Bender,Destructor, I am Destructor!
Raging Bender,Bender, [squeaky] See you at the fight.
Raging Bender,Bender," So then I said, ""See you at the fight."" And that's the story."
Raging Bender,Fry," Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro wrestling. But it turns out it's fixed, like boxing."
Raging Bender,Bender," It's one thing to win a fixed fight; there's dignity in that. But to lose? And in this atrocity? I can't do it! Leela, you gotta train me to win."
Raging Bender,Leela," No way! If you wouldn't take my help when you didn't need it, why should I give it to you now when you do need it?"
Raging Bender,Farnsworth, What the hell are you talking about?
Raging Bender,Leela, I don't know. But I'm not helping.
Raging Bender,Announcer, [voice-over; on TV] You loved him as Bender the Offender! Now get ready to hate him as he threatens your sexuality in his new persona ... The Gender Bender!
Raging Bender,Bender, [girly; on TV] I'm a real toughie!
Raging Bender,Announcer, [voice-over; on TV] Squaring off this Sunday versus Destructor!
Raging Bender,Destructor, [on TV] I will destroy you! [He hangs up then picks up again.] And stop calling me!
Raging Bender,Fnog," [on TV] I am Destructor's trainer, Master Fnog. My pupil will be victorious for he has the will of a warrior!"
Raging Bender,Leela," Not Fnog! Bender, let's hit the gym. I'm gonna teach you to fight like a girl!"
Raging Bender,Bender, [determined] I'll put on my tutu!
Raging Bender,"""Cosell"""," Hello and welcome to a remarkable championship bout. Destructor, a robotic armoured tank, whose very use at battle has been ruled a war crime, versus Gender Bender, who wears a pink tutu. [Hermes, his Brain Slug, Fry and Leela are in Bender's corner.] This is Rich Little, imitating Howard Cosell, here at ringside with George Foreman. George, a word in edgewise?"
Raging Bender,Foreman, This could be the most one-sided fight since 1973 when Ali faced an 80-foot tall mechanical Joe Frazier. M-My memory's not what it used to be but I think the entire Earth was destroyed.
Raging Bender,Little," Interesting, if true. The Vegas odds tonight stand at an unprecedented 1000-0; a bet of $0 on Bender pays $1000 if he wins. Still, very few takers."
Raging Bender,Foreman, It's not-not a smart bet.
Raging Bender,Leela," According to the script, you're supposed to prance out and tickle him with your fairy wand. Instead, I want you to prance out and kick his head off!"
Raging Bender,Bender," Got it. Large kickle, hold the tickle!"
Raging Bender,Hermes, Thank God I'm free of that nightmare!
Raging Bender,Bender," Sorry, buddy. Here you go!"
Raging Bender,Hermes, [monotonous] Thank you. It was cold down there on the floor.
Raging Bender,Amy," Here, Professor, I got you a programme."
Raging Bender,Farnsworth," Oh, good. Just let me put on my reading glasses. [He puts on some glasses with super-thick lenses and opens the programme. His lenses rip through it.] Why, Zoidberg, there's a lovely photo of you in here."
Raging Bender,Referee," In this corner, the confused young robot with the golden curls. Weighing 525lbs  The Gender Bender!"
Raging Bender,Zapp, Boo!
Raging Bender,Nixon, [shouting] Get that hippie out of the ring!
Raging Bender,Referee," And in these two corners, weighing 400 tons, the gizmo from Pismo ... Beach, Destructor!"
Raging Bender,Fnog," So, we meet again. Most amusing  Girl who acts like fighter training fighter who acts like girl."
Raging Bender,Leela," Keep laughing, Fnog! [And he does. He walks back to his corner.] Ready, Bender?"
Raging Bender,Bender," I was born ready! Gimme the bell! [The bell dings.] Did you hear a noise? [Destructor punches him across the ring. Bender gets up and snaps his wand then hangs his tutu neatly on a coathanger inside his chest cabinet.] Final boarding call for flight 406, non-stop service to pain. [He kicks Destructor's shin but to no effect.] Now boarding standby passengers--"
Raging Bender,Foreman," This seems like as good a time as any time to bring up my new grill for no reason. [Next to him, a grill grills five steaks.] With its patented design, the fat drains directly into my mouth."
Raging Bender,Bender," [weakly] Fry! Throw in the towel! [He doesn't.] For God's sakes, Fry!"
Raging Bender,Hermes, [monotonous] That's exactly what I was thinking.
Raging Bender,Bender, [weakly] Mommy!
Raging Bender,Leela," OK, Fnog, that's enough. Call him off. Fnog? [There is nothing but an antenna in Fnog's corner.] Hmm."
Raging Bender,Bender, Why won't anyone help me?
Raging Bender,Leela," So, once more we meet again."
Raging Bender,Fnog, Huh?
Raging Bender,Leela," You didn't train Destructor. You're just controlling him like a puppet. I mean, cheating in a fake fight. That's low!"
Raging Bender,Fnog, Better than being a girl. Like you. You're a girl!
Raging Bender,Leela," [ironic] Oh, right. Girls lack the will of the warrior!"
Raging Bender,Bender, Huh? It's bendering time! [He throws some fake punches.] Take this. And this!
Raging Bender,Fnog, You were an excellent student. [Leela throws a punch but he grabs her wrist.] Too bad I was a lousy teacher!
Raging Bender,Bender," I think you misunderstood the concept of ""bendering time""!"
Raging Bender,Fnog, See you in girl hell. I'll be in boy hell -- much nicer!
Raging Bender,Leela, Yes!
Raging Bender,Bender, Yes! [Destructor falls on him.] Oh!
Raging Bender,Referee, And the winner is Destructor!
Raging Bender,Little, I've not seen a spectacle of this nature in all my years impersonating a sportscaster.
Raging Bender,Foreman," It sure was some fight. Interesting side note  As a head without a body, I envy the dead."
Raging Bender,Little, No argument here.
Raging Bender,Fry, Bender? How did the fight go? I heard somebody got flattened!
Raging Bender,Amy," Fry, where's your Brain Slug?"
Raging Bender,Farnsworth, Poor little guy starved to death.
Raging Bender,Leela," I'm proud of you, Bender. Sure, you lost. You lost bad. But the important thing is I beat up someone who hurt my feelings in high school."
Raging Bender,Bender, I'm in tremendous pain here.
Raging Bender,Doubledeal," Great job, kid. You lost and you made it look almost half real. I want you to have this card good for 10% off at Bed Bath & Beyond."
Raging Bender,Bender, Yes! I'm the greatest! The greatest!
Raging Bender,Little, And so ends the chronicle of one of the greatest ever to play the sport.
Raging Bender,Foreman, And he didn't look half bad in the tutu.
Raging Bender,Little, That he did surely not.
Raging Bender,Foreman, What?
Raging Bender,,
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Several years ago I tried to log on to AOL, and it just went through. Whee! We're online!"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Farnsworth," Go ahead, get into these net suits. I designed and tested them myself."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, They smell like burning Rhesus Monkey.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Farnsworth, Really? I guess when you're around it all day you stop noticing. Off you go.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, Hey!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Bender, Behold  The Internet!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, My God! It's full of ads!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, Follow me!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, It's immense.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, It's got every piece of information anyone could ever want.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, So I see!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Zoidberg, What? What's going on here?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Amy," Hey, that's me!"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Bender," No, it isn't. I just took some pictures of your face and stuck them on someone else's body."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, Hey!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Doorman, Are you over 18?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Young Boy, Yes.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Younger Boy, Yes.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Bender," I'm telling you, Fry, they've got a chatroom for everybody. And here it is."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Amy," Ew, that is so gross!"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," Yeah. I'll stick with this one, thank you."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Amy, Yeah.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Bender," [sexfully] Hi, I'm a naughty nurse and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Man," Ooh, you're a dollar naughtier than most."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Bender, So how 'bout them Knicks?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Nerd #1, Hello? Are there any girls in this room at all?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Nerd #2," Yeah, bring on the hot chicks 'cause I'm a hot stud."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Nerd #3, Yeah! So are we!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," I'm a woman, if that's what you mean. [The nerds gasp.] I don't like to play games, so I'll just say I'm a cyclops, I'm a spaceship captain, I'm the only one of my species and I'm interested in meeting a man."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Nerd #4, A woman! I'm scared.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry," Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Bender, [sarcastic] Is the Space Pope reptilian?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Hermes," Get ready for fun, Fry. Nowadays, we have a type of game played entirely on video."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," We call it a ""video game""."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry," [sarcastic] Uh, ""video game"" you say? Well, golly gee, you mighty spacemen of the future will have to show me how it works."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Zoidberg, The doctor is in! [Fry does a somersault and shoots at Zoidberg. He fizzles.] The doctor is out!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Holo-Farnsworth," Everyone, please sign off. We have a delivery. Plus I have to use the phone-- [Bender shatters him and laughs. Leela jumps across a gap and runs up a wall, leaps from it and starts kicking Bender in the head. Farnsworth's head appears again.] Leela, please tell the others that--"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, Who are you?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Cyclops, I saw you in the chat room but you left before I had a chance to talk to you. After all these years of searching for another Cyclops.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, I can't believe it. I've dreamed of this moment all my life.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Cyclops, Do you think perhaps you and I--
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," Fry, you idiot. Ever since I was abandoned on Earth I've been searching for who my people are and where they come from. Then I finally meet another Cyclops and you blast him. You wrecked my one chance to learn who I am!"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry," Oh, Leela, I feel terrible. If there's anything I can ever do-- [He jumps out and shoots Leela.] Gotcha! [She shatters. Fry jumps up and down cheering.] I won! I'm the greatest!"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, Come on. We have work to do.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, Are you still mad at me for wrecking your once-in-a-lifetime chance to learn the meaning of your existence?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," No, I'm just happy you were able to win a video game. Now let's concentrate on getting this desperately-needed popcorn to the people of Cineplex 14, OK?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Operator," [voice-over; on screen] Leela, you've got mail! [Leela sighs.] It's not spam."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, Huh? [She opens the email. The Cyclops appears on the screen.] It's him!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Cyclops, [on screen] To Leela. Subject  Hello. I am Alcazar. Fortunately I wrote down your screenname before I was dispatched by that oafish moron.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, Kicked your ass!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," [on screen] Leela, we have much to discuss. Please come join me on the planet of your birth. Co-ordinates follow."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry," Well, too bad we gotta make that urgent popcorn delivery."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, It'll get there.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," After a whole life of searching, I may finally have found where I belong."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Bender, Too bad it's a dump.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, Look at that statue. It's only got one eye.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, Lazy sculptor!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," Welcome home, Leela."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, Alcazar? [He leaps off the balcony and stands in front of her.] Are you real? Or am I seeing single?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar, Ow! Of course I'm real.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," After all this time, somebody else with one eye who isn't a clumsy carpenter or, uh, a kid with a BB gun."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," It's alright, Leela. You'll never be alone again. [He claps his hand and two lizards run out through an arch, pulling a carriage behind them.] Come, let me introduce you to yourself. Do you mind if your servants walk?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, Not at all!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," We are the last remaining Cyclopses. Our planet is Cyclopia. This is the capital, Cyclops City. Stop me if I'm going too fast for you."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, There's so much information and yet somehow I feel as if I know it all already.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar, This sacred mosaic depicts our goddess of beauty.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry," Hmm, you got any sacred artwork of her from the back?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," Her perfect eye reminds me of yours, Leela. Had our race survived, you would have been a temple priestess or a supermodel."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," Oh, please! Really?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," And there's the infamous pirate, Purple Beard, scourge of the six seas."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, What's over that hill?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar, The Forbidden Valley. A holy sanctuary where no one may tread.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, Is that anything like a cemetery 'cause I gotta take a leak. [Leela slaps him.] Ow!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," Fry, that's offensive to our people. [She turns to Alcazar.] Isn't it?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, Ow!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar, This is my home. I hope you don't think less of me because I live in a giant castle.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," Oh, no, not at all. If anything, I'm more impressed."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Bender, Ooh! I'm gonna need to make some room.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar, In here is where I dream my lonely dreams and cook my simple meals.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, It's all so sad. What happened to our people?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," It's too painful to speak of now. Come, I'll show you your quarters."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Bender, Ow! Ow! Ow!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, I heard you from my room. What's wrong?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," Nothing. It's just-- No, Leela. I don't want to see tears in your perfect eye."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," Please, is it about the fate of our people? Because I'm very interested in that."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," Well, OK. But it's chilly and you're going to be all wet from the tears. Let's go into my chamber."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," [voice-over] It wasn't long ago. Our people were happy and prosperous ... [The flashback cuts to a dark planet with rocky terrain and lots of large molehills.] ... but the eyeless mole people of Subterra 3 grew jealous of our visual prowess. They fired missile in all directions hoping to hit Cyclopia. [A mole man presses a button and several hundred missiles are launched from the planet.] Unfortunately, one of the 40 planets hit, was ours."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Cyclopian Man #1, How far away do you think it is?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Cyclopian Man #2, A trillion miles?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," Things got hot. You look a little hot, actually. You can take off that jacket. [Leela takes her jacket off.] Our people don't like to be hot. Anyway, just before the impact..."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar, [voice-over] Our smartest scientists managed to save one baby.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," Alcazar, I used to be a baby, it might have been me!"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," [voice-over] Fortunately, I was employed as a pool cleaner at the time and, when I emerged from retrieving a dead possum, I found I was the only one left."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, It's so tragic.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," Yes, but the real tragedy is that our race ends with us."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, It doesn't have to.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar, What do you mean?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, You're a male and I'm a female.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar, I'm still not following you.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," Wake up, my king."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," Oh, jeez, what a night. Make me some coffee, would you."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," Uh, sure, OK. What do you take with that?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," Pancakes and sausage. Kitchen's in the basement, pans are in the attic."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, Maybe after breakfast we can talk about rebuilding our civilisation.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry," Mmm! Great pancakes, Leela."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," Yeah, they'll come in handy if I need to cover any tiny manholes. [He chuckles. Bender laughs loudly, scrapes his pancake onto the floor and slips the plate into his chest cabinet. Alcazar turns to Leela.] Listen, hon', we don't want to look like slobs in front of the other species, do we?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, No.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar, So get to work on these dishes. And then organise my collection of naked celebrity photos by name and what you can see.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," Look, Alcazar--"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar, Call me Al.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," Look, Al. I know you've been living alone a long time and I can sympathise, but I'm not your maid."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," You're right, I'm sorry. I guess the relationship isn't going to work. So much for the Cyclops race. I thought it was a pretty good race but, uh--"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," OK, OK, I'll do the dishes. [She looks at the table but it has been cleared.] Hey, where'd they go?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Bender," Ah, Leela's experiencing the greatest joy a woman can feel  Worshipping some low-life jerk."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, He may be some low-life jerk but I don't trust him. I think he's hiding something and I'm gonna find out what it is.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, Try and stop me!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, Al? I did my hair the way you wanted it. [She sits down next to him.] Who are these people?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar, Friends.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," Hey, where'd you get this couch and that TV set and all this stuff?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," They were giving it away on the street corner. Just like you, Leela!"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," Too bad they weren't giving away the three things you actually need  Mouthwash, a back wax and stain-proof underwear."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Rat Woman," You go, girl!"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," By the way, your pal Fry fell into the dungeon. Take him a taco so he doesn't die and stink up the place."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," Come on, Al, can't you let the little guy out?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," Jeez, Leela, twice in one day? I'm not Superman!"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, Why were you sneaking into my people's forbidden valley?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry," 'Cause I think Alcazar's hiding something from you. Listen, Leela, you may not like it, you may not believe it, you may not wanna hear it but Alcazar's a jerk. He's bad for you. He--"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, I know.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, You do?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," Fry, if it's obvious to you with your learning disability then of course it's obvious to me. He's crude and gross and he treats me like a slave."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, Then dump his one-eyed ass.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," I can't. If I leave Alcazar, that's the end of the Cyclops race. And I won't let that happen. Even if it means a lifetime of unhappiness."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar, [from bathroom] Leela! Mop up in aisle number two!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, I'll break up with him at dinner.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, I'll be there.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," Yo, Leela, what gives? Pig says your slop tastes like crap."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Pig, Yeah. Like crap.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry," C'mon, Leela, you deserve better than this guy. Dump him already!"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, I'm trying.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," Hey, everyone, jam a sock in your spit faucets. [Everyone stops eating and looks up.] Not long ago I spent my lonely nights renting slasher flicks with Rat Man and his girlfriend. But then a beautiful woman arrived and-- Stop eating, Pig! And she brought new hope for me and our once great civilisation. Now a million centuries of Cyclops destiny depend on the answer to one question. [He walks around the table to Leela and goes down on one knee.] Leela, will you marry me?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, [whispering] No! No!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, Yes! I will!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Rat Woman, They're getting married!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Amy," Congratulations, Leela!"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Zoidberg, Hello.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Hermes," Oh, this is great!"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, [shaking hands] Glad you could make it.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Bender, [shaking hands] It's a magical day.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, [shaking hands] Welcome!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry," Psst, Leela. You've gotta get me out of here. It's horrible! Eating scraps, letting my waste drop wherever it falls like an animal in the zoo."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, Animals go in the corner.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, The corner! Why didn't I think of that?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," Look, Fry, I'd like to help you but it's my wedding and I'm kind of busy. [She hands him a bottle.] Here. Try to be happy for me. That way at least one of us will be."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, That's it! It's time for this bird to walk.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry," Bender, come on. We've gotta get some dirt on Alcazar. Let's go and find out what makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Bender," Uh, no, thanks. I'm good."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, But there's probably some cool forbidden stuff you can steal.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Bender," I don't know, Fry. For the first time in my life I feel like I've stolen enough."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry," Bender, snap out of it!"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Bender," Sorry, I don't know what came over me. Let's go. [He slings his sack of swag over his shoulder.] [singing] I love stealing, I love taking things!"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Zoidberg, [crying] That pig over there is wearing the same sandals as me.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry," Come on, boy, jump! [The lizards crash through the gate.] Good boy!"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Bender," Whoa, Mittens!"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, My God! Four identical castles!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Bender, Each more identical than the last!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry," That's weird. It's another Cyclops, only this one has five eyes."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Bender, And here's another one with no eyes.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Preacherbot, Does anyone have a reason why this couple shall not be joined in the irrevocable shackles of holy bliss?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Farnsworth, Saving a race of one-eyed monsters? Who could object to that?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," Cut to the chase, Preach!"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Preacherbot," Do you, Alcazar ... [Alcazar fast-forwards the Preacherbot.] ... [fast] take this woman before you ... to love ... in sickness ... do you part?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," Yeah, sure I do. Come on, faster!"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Preacherbot," Do you, Leela, copy and paste his response till death do you part?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, I ... d--
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Amy," Oh, my God!"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar, What the--?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry," Hey, Alcazar, you left somebody off the guest list."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Five-Eyed Woman," Alcazar, why you are so late for our wedding? And why you have only one eye?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," It ... ooh, uh! [He grows four more eyes.] Hey, sweetie. Just go back to the castle and wait for me. [He turns to Leela and returns to his one eye.] She-- She's nuts. I can morph into a five-eyed alien and I kinda said I'd marry her. But I'm really a Cyclops and I'm really going to marry you."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry," Oh, yeah? Then what about this?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar, This is a bit awkward.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Five-Eyed Woman, Who's she?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, Who's she?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Sandy, Who are they?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," Go back to the castle, Sandy."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry, And maybe you'd like to meet her. [A purple alien comes in.] And her.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," Leela, this must all be very confusing."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, A little. That's why I've decided to hurt you until you explain it.
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Sandy, Show us your real form!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, Yeah!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alien #2, Do it!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," Well, this is the real me. But I can explain  We all have needs. Mine was to make it with five weirdos and have them scrub my five castles. I gave you all what you wanted and of course I made a few bucks letting Pig watch through the two-way mirror. Can any of you say you wouldn't have done the exact same thing in my position?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Bender, [crying] He's a saint!
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela, But why did you have all five weddings on the same day?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar," Hey, lady, you got any idea what it costs to rent a tux that changes shape?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," Alright, Alcazar, I just have one last question for you."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Alcazar, What's that?
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," If you can change form, why didn't you change it in the one place that counts?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," Thanks for saving me from that creep, Fry."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Fry," Hey, that's what I do."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," I guess I was so desperate to find out who I really was, I forgot who I really was."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Farnsworth," No harm done. In the many decades you'll work to repay me for that shipment of popcorn you destroyed, you'll have plenty of time to search for your true home."
A Bicyclops Built for Two,Leela," Yeah. I mean, how many planets can there be?"
A Bicyclops Built for Two,,
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! The university is bringing me up on disciplinary charges. Wait, that's not good news at all."
A Clone of My Own,Leela," Whatever you did, Professor, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation."
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," Yes, but they won't listen. Everyone's always in favour of saving Hitler's brain but when you put it in the body of a great white shark, ooh, suddenly you've gone too far."
A Clone of My Own,Vernon," Professor Farnsworth, do you know why we've called you here today?"
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," Listen to me, you pompous frauds. If I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me. Dean Vernon, I know the truth  It was you driving your hover-car that night, not your horse. Dean Epsilon, I know all about your ""Department of Pool Boy Studies"". And Dr. Wernstrom ... Wernstrom!"
A Clone of My Own,Vernon," Actually, Professor, we merely called you here to say... [The lights come on.] Surprise!"
A Clone of My Own,Man #1, Surprise!
A Clone of My Own,Man #2, Happy birthday!
A Clone of My Own,Hermes, Surprise!
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," And you, Coach Smalley, or should I say ""Coach hairpiece""?"
A Clone of My Own,Leela," No, Professor! It's a surprise party for your 150th birthday."
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth, [muttering] Hundred and ... what? [He smiles.] Ooh!
A Clone of My Own,Bender," Good evening, I'm-- [Feedback. He turns the knob on the side of his casing.] Whoa, sorry. I'm Bender and I'll be emceeing this roast. Y'know, they say you can judge a man by the company he keeps. So here's the Professor's oldest friend, a grotesque, stinking lobster."
A Clone of My Own,Zoidberg," Good evening, ladies and germs. [The band plays a rimshot.] That wasn't a joke, I was talking to Dean Streptococcus. [In the audience a big green germ waves.] Now, I'm not saying Professor Farnsworth is old, but if you consider his age, he's likely to die soon. [He grins. There is no rimshot and the audience don't laugh. A man drums his fingers on the table.] Hey, Ringo, that was the joke. Oh, it's Showtime at the Apollo all over again."
A Clone of My Own,Bender," Where would the Professor be without students who love and respect him? Right there! [He points at Farnsworth and chuckles.] But seriously, of all the former crew members of the Professor's delivery ship, our next speaker is by far the most alive. Captain Musky?"
A Clone of My Own,Zoidberg, I wouldn't wanna follow that guy!
A Clone of My Own,Bender," And now, a man who needs no introduction. [He sits down and everyone looks around in confusion, Leela to her right and Zoidberg to the ceiling. Bender leans over to Fry.] [whispering] Fry, get up there!"
A Clone of My Own,Fry," Oh. [He takes the mic and the audience applauds.] Thank you. Y'know, when I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Professor Farnsworth, I thought ""Why should I?"" Then later Leela made the film. But if I had made the film, you could bet there would have been a lot more topless women on motorcycles! [Farnsworth smiles.] Roll film!"
A Clone of My Own,Leela," [voice-over; in movie] Hubert J. Farnsworth was born April 9th 2851 in New New York's nerdiest slum, Hell's Laboratory. A precocious child, young Hubert learned to read while he was still in diapers -- at age 8. [A photo of young Farnsworth sitting reading a book on some steps in diapers appears on the screen.] And before long he blossomed into a greasy teenager."
A Clone of My Own,Fry, [whispering] Dork alert!
A Clone of My Own,Leela," [voice-over; in movie] After 14 years of graduate school, Farnsworth settled into the glamorous life of a scientist  Fast cars, trendy nightspots, beautiful women -- the Professor designed them all working out of his tiny, one-room apartment. [The pictures appear on a blackboard in his apartment.] For 50 years he worked at Mom's Friendly Robot Company, where he created the first robot capable of qualifying for a boat loan. [There is a short video clip of the robot buying its boat. The picture changes to Farnsworth tinkering with Bender's head.] And even as he nears his 150th birthday, the Professor retains the fiery passion of youth."
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," [in movie] Listen, you pompous frauds. If I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me."
A Clone of My Own,Bender," How 'bout a few words, Professor?"
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," Eh, wha?"
A Clone of My Own,Bender," I said ""words""."
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," Uh, what a pleasure it is to see my lifetime of accomplishment summed up in a 3-minute film. My best years are behind me. So much left undone. So little time."
A Clone of My Own,Bender," Funny, funny stuff."
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth, My life is over.
A Clone of My Own,Leela," No, it isn't. You have another 10 years left."
A Clone of My Own,Fry, Leela! He could live another 100 years!
A Clone of My Own,Leela," No, he couldn't. When you turn 160, robots from the Sunset Squad take you to a mysterious planet and you never return."
A Clone of My Own,Fry," Wow, a whole planet of old people. Where is it?"
A Clone of My Own,Bender, [spookily] Nobody knows!
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," So many loves half-loved, so many inventions half-invented. That damn time machine alone set me back 15 years."
A Clone of My Own,Zoidberg," If only it'd worked, you could go back and not waste your time on it."
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," There's no one to carry on after I'm gone. No one to take care of my work and my research and my fabulous fortune. [He gasps.] By God, that's it! I've got to name a successor."
A Clone of My Own,Fry, A successor?
A Clone of My Own,Zoidberg, A successor to the Professor?
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth, There's no time to lose. I'm off to my lab to build a successor-naming machine!
A Clone of My Own,Fry," Man, the Professor's been in his lab for days."
A Clone of My Own,Bender, I hope he didn't die. Unless he left a note naming me his successor. Then I hope he did die.
A Clone of My Own,Zoidberg, You? The successor? Over my empty shell! The Professor will pick me. Only I have his lobster-like tenacity.
A Clone of My Own,Hermes," Up yours, Zoidberg. Up wherever your species traditionally crams things. The only sensible way to choose a successor is with a limbo contest."
A Clone of My Own,Leela, What?
A Clone of My Own,Hermes," Kingston rules. Two men go down, one come up."
A Clone of My Own,Leela," Look, the Professor trusts me with a giant spaceship. He wouldn't trust the rest of you with his dentures."
A Clone of My Own,Amy," Yesh, he would."
A Clone of My Own,Fry," Sorry, everyone, but need I remind you? Blood is thicker than water."
A Clone of My Own,Zoidberg, [writing] Blood ... thicker ... water.
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," Everyone, I have a very dramatic announcement. So anyone with a weak heart should leave now. Goodbye."
A Clone of My Own,Leela," Uh, Professor?"
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," Oh, oh, yes, the announcement! As you all know, I am not long for this world."
A Clone of My Own,Leela," Yes, we know."
A Clone of My Own,Hermes," True, mon."
A Clone of My Own,Amy, Buh!
A Clone of My Own,Fry, One foot in the grave.
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth, So I've picked my successor. It's someone in whom I have great faith -- even though his mind is undeveloped and he's accomplished nothing. [Fry flexes his fingers and chuckles.] My closest living relative.
A Clone of My Own,Fry," Oh, yeah!"
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," My clone, Cubert Farnsworth."
A Clone of My Own,Zoidberg, He's horrible!
A Clone of My Own,Fry, Crud. Can I at least be in charge of your dentures?
A Clone of My Own,Amy, You wish!
A Clone of My Own,Fry, Where did Cubert come from?
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth, 12 years ago I began the cloning process by removing some skin cells from one of the shapelier growths on my back.
A Clone of My Own,Leela," Wait. If he's your clone, why doesn't his nose look like yours?"
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth, I left him in his first tube too long and he got squished up against the side.
A Clone of My Own,Bender, Is he dumb or just ugly?
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth, Let's find out.
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, What? You've never seen a genius's wiener before?
A Clone of My Own,Zoidberg, No.
A Clone of My Own,Leela, Never.
A Clone of My Own,Fry," Well, once in the park."
A Clone of My Own,Zoidberg, Mmm!
A Clone of My Own,Cubert," As long as I'm going to be in charge here, let me examine my so-called ""crew"", if it can so be called. First of all, Dr. Zoidberg, do you even have a medical degree?"
A Clone of My Own,Zoidberg, I lost it ... in a volcano.
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, And why do we need a bending robot around here anyway? What possible use do we have for you?
A Clone of My Own,Bender, Uh ... me no speaka the English.
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, And why does our space pilot have only one eye? There's someone I'd like you to meet. His name is depth perception!
A Clone of My Own,Leela," Why, you little--"
A Clone of My Own,Cubert," Wow, that hurt -- the air!"
A Clone of My Own,Bender, Im pending para un bending!
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," Oh, Cubert, come in here. I have something amazing to show you."
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, What is it? A competent employee? I doubt that very much!
A Clone of My Own,Fry, Little twerp.
A Clone of My Own,Bender," Aye, Chihuahua!"
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," As my successor, I'm trusting you to carry on my work. These are just some of the half-finished inventions you'll spend your life finishing."
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, I didn't realise you were the inventor of the junk heap.
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," That's my prize-winning Smellescope. If a dog craps anywhere in the universe, you can bet I won't be out of the loop. [He points at a green machine with an oscilloscope built into it.] And this is my universal translator. Unfortunately so far it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language."
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, Hello.
A Clone of My Own,Universal Translator, Bonjour!
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth, Crazy gibberish!
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, Don't you have any worthwhile inventions?
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," Why, certainly. Step over here."
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth, These are the dark matter engines I invented. They allow my starship to travel between galaxies in mere hours.
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, That's impossible. You can't go faster than the speed of light.
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth, Of course not. That's why scientists increased the speed of light in 2208.
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, Also impossible.
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth, And what makes my engines truly remarkable is the afterburner which delivers 200% fuel efficiency.
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, That's especially impossible.
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth, Not at all. It's very simple.
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, Then explain it.
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth, Now that's impossible. It came to me in a dream and I forgot it in another dream.
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, Your explanations are pure weapons-grade bolog-nium. It's all impossible.
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth, Nothing is impossible. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being is a scientist is all about.
A Clone of My Own,Cubert," No, that's what being a magical elf is all about."
A Clone of My Own,Bender," Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's Elzar, the TV chef! Oh, kill me now, people!"
A Clone of My Own,Elzar, How we doing here?
A Clone of My Own,Bender," Oh, Elzar, everything's so good!"
A Clone of My Own,Elzar," What are you, an ass-kissing machine?"
A Clone of My Own,Bender," Yes, sir! Good one, sir!"
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," Oh, it's a gem of an evening. I feel so wonderful having someone to take over my life's work. And it's all thanks to Cubert."
A Clone of My Own,Cubert," Look, Professor, I may be identical to you in every possible way but that doesn't mean I'm anything like you."
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth, You ... wha?
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, I don't wanna be an inventor. I wanna be something useful like a teacher's aide or a prison guard or a science-fiction cartoon writer.
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth, But-But what about my hopes and my dreams and my wonderful inventions?
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, In your entire life your only half-decent invention was me and I didn't turn out like you wanted either.
A Clone of My Own,Elzar, You folks still doing alright?
A Clone of My Own,Bender," Oh, yes, Elzar."
A Clone of My Own,Elzar," Good, 'cause it turns out I forgot to cook that chicken."
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," Bad news, everyone. By the time you watch this tape, I'll be gone, leaving behind me nothing but a history of failure and my original hip-bones. You see, I've been lying about my age; I'm not actually 150, I'm 160. Oh, vanity, thy name is Professor Farnsworth. And now that I have nothing to live for, I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me away."
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," Goodbye, cruel world. [He stops walking.] Goodbye, cruel lamp. [He stops again by the window.] Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin ... [The Reaperbot growls.] ... and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords, cruel though they may be a--"
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," [on holo-recorder] And now that I've nothing to live for, I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me away."
A Clone of My Own,Amy, What?
A Clone of My Own,Hermes," Oh, no!"
A Clone of My Own,Zoidberg, Oh.
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," [on holo-recorder] I know you're all very upset, especially Bender."
A Clone of My Own,Bender," Well, life goes on. Except for you!"
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," [on holo-recorder] I'm sure that Bender has just made a cutting remark, but he doesn't know I taped over his soap operas to record this message."
A Clone of My Own,Bender, You bastard!
A Clone of My Own,Fry, We've gotta get him back.
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, Impossible! No one knows where they take those old geezers.
A Clone of My Own,Fry," Nothing is impossible. You'd know that if you really took after the Professor, like I do."
A Clone of My Own,Cubert," You're his uncle, dummy. He takes after you."
A Clone of My Own,Fry, Uh ... what?
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, Wait a second. That means I also take after you!
A Clone of My Own,Leela, Quiet. I think I know how to find the Professor.
A Clone of My Own,Bender," Lay it on us, big boots."
A Clone of My Own,Leela," If the Smellescope can pick up the Professor's odour, we may have a chance to save him."
A Clone of My Own,Cubert," I think not. As you probably already don't know, odours are made up of particles that can't travel through the vacuum of space."
A Clone of My Own,Leela, I'm zeroing in on him. [She sniffs.] BENGAY ... mothballs ... [She sniffs again.] ... letters to the editor. It's the Professor!
A Clone of My Own,Bender, To the flying machine!
A Clone of My Own,Fry," To the left! [He sniffs again and moves slightly.] No, to the up! [And some more.] U-turn! U-turn!"
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, We'll never find this place. Robots are very good at keeping secrets.
A Clone of My Own,Bender," No, we're not, you little bed-wetter. Oops! I'm sorry."
A Clone of My Own,Leela, There it is! The Near-Death Star!
A Clone of My Own,Leela," OK, we'll tell them the Professor escaped and we're bringing him back. Fry, you'll have to dress up like a 160-year-old man."
A Clone of My Own,Fry, I'm on it!
A Clone of My Own,Cubert," [sarcastic] My God, the illusion is so perfect I almost forgot I was looking at an idiot!"
A Clone of My Own,Leela," Now, they may ask for a DNA sample."
A Clone of My Own,Fry, I'd like to see them find it!
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, This plan is impossible. We don't even have a sample of the Professor's DNA.
A Clone of My Own,Bender, I think I know where to get some.
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, Why do I have to be the hump?
A Clone of My Own,Fry, 'Cause you're too ugly to be a wart.
A Clone of My Own,Leela, Your Medicare dollars at work.
A Clone of My Own,Barrierbot #1, Halt! Identify this guest.
A Clone of My Own,Leela," Uh, this is Professor Hubert Farnsworth. He escaped."
A Clone of My Own,Barrierbot #1, Escaped? No one escapes.
A Clone of My Own,Barrierbot #2, This guest does not look 160.
A Clone of My Own,Fry," What? I'm old. Listen  [old man voice] Hey, you kids, get off the lawn!"
A Clone of My Own,Barrierbot #1," Hmm, it is true old people are often concerned that there are children on their lawns."
A Clone of My Own,Barrierbot #2, There's no denying that. But we'll still need to verify his identity with a DNA sample.
A Clone of My Own,Bender," Got a hot, steaming batch right here!"
A Clone of My Own,Barrierbot #2, We only needed one cell!
A Clone of My Own,Bender," Eh, keep the change, buddy."
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, Stupid robot.
A Clone of My Own,Barrierbot #1, Did your hump just say something?
A Clone of My Own,Fry, Uh ... I-I've got talking hump syndrome.
A Clone of My Own,Barrierbot #1," Ah, T.H.S."
A Clone of My Own,Barrierbot #2, Identity confirmed. Return this shambling shuffle-boarder to his room.
A Clone of My Own,Barrierbot #1, 7152 Maple Drive.
A Clone of My Own,Leela, Sounds nice.
A Clone of My Own,Barrierbot #1, Prepare to be surprised.
A Clone of My Own,Fry, So this is where they stick old people. It's horrific!
A Clone of My Own,Leela, At least it keeps them from driving.
A Clone of My Own,Leela, Brace yourself for the worst.
A Clone of My Own,Bender, And yet he looks so natural.
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, What's happening?
A Clone of My Own,Leela," He's hooked up to a life-support system. [She pulls a tube off.] We have to disconnect him very, very carefully, or the shock could kill him."
A Clone of My Own,Guardbot #1, Freeze! [Leela pulls Farnsworth away from the tubes in one go and accelerates the hover-ship away from the guardbot. He chases them around the side of the gravestone and five other guardbots give chase.] Seize them!
A Clone of My Own,Guardbot #2, Seize them!
A Clone of My Own,Guardbot #3, Seize them!
A Clone of My Own,Guardbot #4, Seize them!
A Clone of My Own,Guardbot #1, Get them-- I mean seize them!
A Clone of My Own,Guardbot #2," Aww, I'm so bad at this!"
A Clone of My Own,Guardbot #3, Uh-oh!
A Clone of My Own,Leela," We're probably gonna make it, but we might not."
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, It's impossible! We'll never fit.
A Clone of My Own,Fry, Will too!
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, Told you.
A Clone of My Own,Fry," Come on, Leela! Step your big boot down on the gas pedal."
A Clone of My Own,Leela, They've blown out one of our engines!
A Clone of My Own,Fry, [fast] Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it!
A Clone of My Own,Leela, Only the Professor knows how to fix it. We have to wake him up.
A Clone of My Own,Fry, Try shocking him.
A Clone of My Own,Bender, [shouting] Your social security cheque is late! Stuff costs more than it used to! Young people use curse words!
A Clone of My Own,Fry," Damnit, we'll have to fix the engine ourself."
A Clone of My Own,Leela," We can't, you bastard! No one knows how it works. It's impossible!"
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, Nothing is impossible. I understand how the engines work now. It came to me in a dream. [He lifts an access hatch and starts fiddling with some wires under the floor.] The engines don't move the ship at all. The ship stays where it is and the engines move the universe around it.
A Clone of My Own,Bender, That's a complete load.
A Clone of My Own,Cubert," Nothing's a complete load. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being a scientist is all about. Right, Professor? [Farnsworth mumbles. Cubert closes the access panel.] Let's ride!"
A Clone of My Own,Cubert," Good news, everyone! He's made a complete recovery."
A Clone of My Own,Amy, Yeah!
A Clone of My Own,Hermes, Wow!
A Clone of My Own,Leela, All right!
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth, I'm as spry as a 140-year-old. [He jumps and something cracks.] See? I only broke one ankle.
A Clone of My Own,Fry, So what were they doing to you in that awful drawer?
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," Oh, they had me hooked up to a bizarre virtual world that seemed absolutely real."
A Clone of My Own,Amy, What was it like?
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," It was as though I were living in a facility in Florida with hundreds of other old people. All day long we'd play bingo, eat oatmeal and wait for our children to call."
A Clone of My Own,Leela, It's a hundred times more horrible than anything I could imagine.
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," Oh, my, yes. Thank you all for saving me. Especially you, my little clone. No matter what you decide to do with your life, I'm still proud of you."
A Clone of My Own,Cubert," I've already decided. Dad, when I grow up I wanna be just like you."
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth," Don't worry, son, you will. Incidentally, you might want to read up on a condition known as ""wandering bladder""."
A Clone of My Own,Cubert, Why?
A Clone of My Own,Farnsworth, No reason. No reason at all.
A Clone of My Own,,
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes," Finally, the last form of the day. Welcome to Stampy Town. Population, five! [He stamps the form five times then puts it on top of a pile of other forms. He picks up the pile and staples it together.] And now for the finishing touch. [He puts the pile through a shredder and it comes out as mulch, which is recycled into blank sheets of paper. A robotic arm lifts the paper into the in-tray.] Ah, the cycle of bureaucracy. [A red tube comes down a message tube and lands in a tray.] Sweet gorilla of Manila! A letter from the Central Bureaucracy! [He takes a piece of paper out of the red tube.] [reading] Attention, Hermes Conrad  You are about to receive a letter from the Central Bureaucracy. [Another red tube appears and Hermes takes a piece of paper out of.] My God! It's from the Central Bureaucracy!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela, I'm having a poker game tonight with some friends from my old cryogenics job. You guys interested?
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender, I don't know. I only gamble with chumps.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry, I'll play.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender, I'm in!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Zoidberg," Leela, Fry, robot. No matter what it is you're doing tonight, I'm available."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela," We're playing poker. But I'm warning you, my friends are serious players."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Zoidberg," Bah, big shots. I say let the dice do the talking."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry, Wow! You look happy. Is someone fired?
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes," Better! The Central Bureaucracy is conducting an inspection tomorrow. I will finally be promoted to grade 35, the 35th highest grade there is."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela," Hermes, wait! We're having a poker party. Stay and whip off a batch of your famous jerk dip."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes," Sorry, I spent all day putting my office in order. Now I got to go home and relax the traditional Jamaican way  A glass of warm milk and good night sleep."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry, Jamaican? I thought you were some kinda outer-space potato man.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela," Ah, that must be my old boss."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Ipgee," Hello, Leela. You're fired."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela, I know.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Ipgee, I'm sorry but it's just that you're over a year late for work at this point.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Terry, [dramatically] Let the games begin!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Ipgee," So I told Leela, ""Your request for a date is most flattering but I must decline."" These office romances never work out. After all, that is how I met my horrible wife."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela, But you never wore your ring. I didn't know you had a wife.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Ipgee, And my wife doesn't know I have a job. I keep my personal and professional lives separate.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender," Come on, let's deal. You'll have plenty of time to talk when you're poor."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry," What's with the specs, Bender?"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender, They're my lucky shades. I stole them off some lucky guy while his lucky seeing eye dog was taking a whiz.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry, Hey!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Zoidberg, I can't spell anything with these cards.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Zoidberg," Finally, I have a good claw. See? [He turns his cards around.] Three human females, a number and a king giving himself brain surgery."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry," It doesn't matter how many human females you have, Bender's on a hot streak."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender," Uh, what can I say? Must be my lucky shades! [He taps his shades and they suddenly change to X-Ray specs. He looks at the cards around the table.] Nothing, nothing, crap, crap, garbage. [He lays his cards out on the table.] Read 'em and leak salt water!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry," Oh, man!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Terry, That's my baby's milk money!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Ipgee," Oh, I am broke. What will I tell my horrible wife?"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender, If I were you I'd be more worried about that tapeworm going to town on your intestines.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Ipgee, [suspicious] Let me see those glasses.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender, Um ... uh...
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Ipgee," Oh, my various Gods! X-Ray specs!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender," Guys, I swear those are prescription. I need 'em for reading stuff ... on the other side of stuff."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Lou, Cheater!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Ipgee, Get him!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Terry, Break his neck!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Zoidberg," No, don't hurt him! He's my best friend!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender," [from inside] Hey, you wouldn't hit a guy with X-Ray glasses would you? [Beating sounds come from inside.] Ow! Easy on the arm! Oh! Oh, my ass!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes, Great cow of Moscow!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender," Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones! And a tornado!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes, Oh! I'll never pass inspection now. They'll bust me lower than a limbo stick ... at carnival time. [Fry and Leela poke their heads around the door.] [crying] And that's as low as limbo sticks get.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry," Aw, hey, c'mon, don't worry. We'll watch you clean up."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes, It's too late. The inspector will be here in exactly one second.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes, Who the hell are you?
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," Morgan Proctor, bureaucrat grade 19."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes," Hermes Conrad, bureaucrat grade 36."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan, Enough friendly banter. Shall we begin the inspection?
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes," This way, please."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry," [whispering] Jeez, Hermes, you seem awfully calm about this."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes, [whispering] Don't worry. I have a plan.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes, [shouting] I'm going to jump!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Amy, [shouting] No!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Zoidberg, [shouting] No!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender, [shouting] Do a flip!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela," [shouting] Don't do it, Hermes! You have so much to live for."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender," [whispering; to Leela] I get it, reverse psychology."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Farnsworth," [shouting] Please, old friend, don't jump. Use another method that won't damage your liver. Other people need it, you know."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,LaBarbara, [shouting] Husband! Nooo!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes," Outta my way, wife! I wasn't cut out to be a bureaucrat anyway. I'm only anal 78.36% of the time. I'm not worthy to stamp a form, so I'll stamp the pavement with my flabby body."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," [shouting] Bureaucrat Conrad, if you complete your death transaction without filing a suicide and/or falling accident permit, you will be posthumously demoted."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes, Life. Death. Either way I'm demoted to a tiny cubicle.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes, Sweet something of ... of someplace.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," As your superior, I hereby relieve you of duty. Consider yourself on paid vacation."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes, Oh! The ultimate penalty!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Zoidberg," I recommend the health cure on Spa 5, the sauna planet. Here, read."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,LaBarbara, Spa 5? Is it good?
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Zoidberg," Oh, it's wonderful! I don't know anything about it but they give me a bucket of krill for every patient I send."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," Naturally I'll have to assign a bureaucrat to fill in for Hermes while he's away. I assign me, I accept. Welcome aboard."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Zoidberg, Then it's settled. Hermes will relax and Zoidberg will eat. Hurrah!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," I've been reviewing your corporate records. Regarding last Monday's delivery, why did it take twice as long as scheduled?"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela, Fry got his head stuck in a crater.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry, [ashamed] I thought it would fit.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," [to Bender] And during this period of head-crater interaction, what were you doing?"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender, Martini drinking contests with the autopilot. I would've had him this time but we ran out of olives.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela, I can explain--
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan, You really think you can explain how you left port without a full compliment of olives? I think not.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela," [whispering] What is this, high school?"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan, Locker check!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan, Why isn't this jacket in alphabetical order?
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela, What?
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan, The zipper. It should be at the bottom.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender," [ashamed] Hey, sometimes a guy gets lonely."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan, I-- I've never seen anything like this. [She picks up the cap.] Why is there yoghurt in this cap?
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry," Uh, I can explain that. See, it used to be milk and, well, time makes fools of us all."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," You are all dismissed. Fry, I will speak to you alone."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry," Uh, wait, this is the other Fry's locker. I'm ""Phry"" with a P-H."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," [taking off her glasses.] Admit it, Fry  You're a slob. [She kisses him.] A dirty, filthy slob. [She kisses him again.] Dirty boy! Dirty! Dirty! Dirty!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry, What the hell's going on? I thought you were anti-dirty not pro-dirty.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan, I'm surrounded by neat freaks everyday. There's nothing kinkier to me than a filthy slop-jock like you.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry," [bashful] Oh, stop!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," Now listen, you filthy pig. No one can know about us. If anyone asks, I'll deny it."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry, Just like very other girl I've dated.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Woman," And two and three and four and ... [She point a huge laser at them.] ... come on, work those arms!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,LaBarbara," [whispering] This is no spa, it's a forced-labour camp."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes," Curse that Dr. Zoidberg! If I get out of here, he'll be looking down the business-end of a shrimp fork."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Australian Man," Give him one for me too, mate. I don't know why I go to him."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Woman," I don't miss twice, campers!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," And for those six and a half reasons, I am demoting Leela to co-pilot."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela, Co-pilot? Under who?
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan, The autopilot.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela, That drunk?
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," Mr. Bender, you are now in charge of co-ordinating the Professor's bodily functions."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Farnsworth, That's a full-time job.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," And Fry, as for you, I am promoting you to executive delivery boy. You will no longer go on deliveries and you will have your own office next to mine."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry, Alright!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," Mr. Bender, would you high-five him so we can continue this meeting? [Bender reluctantly does.] And on the rebound? [Bender kicks Fry in his left shin and Fry screams.] Meeting adjourned."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Amy," I can't figure why she's so nice to you, Fry."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Zoidberg," She's a hateful monster, this Morgan. She scolded and hit me. I tell you, she's risking my friendship with her."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela," Bender, what happened to you?"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender," Morgan made me walk the Professor. There we were in the park when suddenly some old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked the Professor at her but she kept coming. So I had to hit her with this purse I found. Ah, the point is, it's Morgan's fault. That pencil-pushing scazwag. [Leela gestures him to shut up.] Why, if she were here, I'd-- Uh-oh, is she behind me?"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan, No. I'm in front of you.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry, Morgan? It's 3am.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," I know. A skunk knocked over my garbage and suddenly all I could think of was you. [She looks around the messy apartment.] My God! It's so ... repulsive. [She looks at something covered with a sheet and food.] So, uh, this is where you eat?"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry, Eat and sleep.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," Oh, Fry!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry," Uh, wait, Bender's my roommate. He could be back any second."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan, Not likely. I ordered him to flush out the Professor's ear wax.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender," Hey, Fry, I made you a candle with-- [He gasps.] What the--? [He zooms in. Morgan is in bed with Fry. She holds the sheets up around her. Fry pulls the sheets up around him.] Oh, now I see! Now I get it. Now the pieces are falling into place  The office, the promotion, that dwarf in my book club who steals my opinions. [Morgan runs out with the sheets wrapped around her.] It's all coming together now!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender," I must say, this opens my eyes. Another case closed, my dear Watson."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry," [shouting] Morgan, come back! He's stuck in a loop."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender, For I was blind but now I see!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender, [from inside] The cat's out of the bag now!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," Mr. Bender, about last night  That was just a ... a misunderstanding."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender," Oh, you didn't understand? Well let me explain. You ... [He points at Fry.] ... were having sex with you."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," No. You see, a bureaucrat of my rank isn't supposed to fraternise."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender," That's what makes it so juicy. It's the forbidden fruit angle everybody loves. First I'll say ""You'll never guess who saw Fry and Morgan doing it,"" and they'll say ""Who, Bender? Who?"" and I'll say ""It was lovable ... [His voice begins to slow down.] ... old Bender."""
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry," Hey, what did you do to him?"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," I downloaded his brain. Everything that is Bender is right here. His mind, his memories, his in-your-face interface."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender, [mechanical voice] I am Bender. Please insert girder.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry," But, but ... Bender need brain ... for ... smart making. [Morgan puts the disk in a red tube and sends it away.] What did you do now? Stop doing things!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," I sent the disk to be filed at the Central Bureaucracy. I did what I had to do, Fry; He was a bad robot."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry," No, he was a bad friend. I want him back right now."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan, Then you should have filed a request 20 years ago.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry, I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan, Dirty boy! Dirty boy!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela, You and Morgan were having an affair?
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry, I couldn't help it. She loved me because of the part of me that's a slob and I loved her because of the part of me that's desperate.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender, [mechanical voice] I am Bender. Please insert girder.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry, Poor Bender. Without his brain he's become all quiet and helpful. We've got to go to the Central Bureaucracy and get that disk back!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Amy, Yeah!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Farnsworth," Oh, yes, we must, yes."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Amy, Why?
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela," Well, those arguments aside, we're still going."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Farnsworth, You can't just waltz into the Central Bureaucracy. It's a tangled web of red tape and regulations. I've never been but a friend of mine went completely mad trying to find the washroom there.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela, Then we'll need a guide. Someone who's been there before.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Farnsworth," Oh, I've been there. Lots of times!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes, Look at that  The carts go out full but they come in empty. It's criminally inefficient.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Australian Man," [whispering] Quiet, mate. Pulling the empty carts is the closest thing we get to sleep."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes, But don't you see? They could increase efficiency 4% if they used the empty carts to bring in heavy mining machinery.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Man," Hey, I like the way you think."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Australian Man," Oh, Lord!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Man," You know, you oughta be a bureaucrat or something."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry," Man, how long is this gonna take?"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Old Man, I'm still waiting on my birth certificate.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Farnsworth," Well, it doesn't look like I'll make it inside with the rest of you. Uh, but good luck. Just leave me where I drop."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Old Man," Oh, great! Someone had a baby."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela, Come on. I have a better idea.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela, Excuse me? We're from the Planet Express delivery company. We're here to deliver a robot.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender, [mechanical voice] I am Bender. Please insert girder.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Grade 53 Bureaucrat, Looks like we've got a new office cut-up!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Grade 41 Bureaucrat, Look out! Look out! I'm gonna crash my slow-mobile! I had to swerve to avoid you.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela," While you're crashing, could you tell us where all these canisters end up?"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Grade 41 Bureaucrat," Oh, you want Central Filing."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela, OK.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry, OK.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Amy," OK, thanks."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Farnsworth, Wonderful.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Grade 41 Bureaucrat, [screaming] Nooo!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Grade 20 Bureaucrat, Central Filing? Of course I know where that is. I'm a grade 20.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela, Where is it?
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Grade 20 Bureaucrat, I can't tell you. What do I look like? A grade 16?
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela," We're getting nowhere slowly. Here, I'll address this to the Central Filing room. [She takes something of her wrist machine and puts it in the tube.] Then we'll track it using my wrist LoJack-a-mater."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Wrist Machine," Cold. Cold. Warmer. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Grade 11 Bureaucrat, Please don't tell my supervisor I was sleeping.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela," This is it. We'll just run in, grab Bender's disk and run out. Got it?"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry," We'll never find that disk will we, Bender?"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender, [mechanical voice] I am Bender. Please insert girder.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry, You're right. Nothing is over as long as there's one thin ray of hope.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan, Lost something? [She rides a slow-mobile towards them.] I should have known you'd come here rather than follow proper procedure. And I did know. And that's why I came here.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry," Listen, Morgan, we're through. You're an evil, heartless woman and I never wanna see you again. However, would you help us get Bender back for old time's sake?"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," I'm afraid he's lost in the master in pile, and it would take some sort of giant, mechanical, atomic-powered sorting machine to find him."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes, You rang?
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Farnsworth," Damnit, Hermes, just jump already. Stop hogging that healthy liver."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes," No, I want to live. Organising that forced-labour spa rekindled my lifelong love of bureaucracy."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,LaBarbara, My Hermes got that hellhole running so efficiently that all the physical labour is now done by a single Australian man.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela, But how did you know we were here?
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes, Dr. Zoidberg brought us.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Zoidberg, It was me! I'm the hero!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Number 1.0, Request for explanation of incident meeting?
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan, Number 1.0.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes," Number 1.0, I hereby petition you for an emergency sort-and-file, under regulation 2 point--"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Number 1.0, [waggling his finger] D-D-D-D-Don't quote me regulations. I co-chaired the committee that reviewed the recommendation to revise the colour of the book that regulation's in. We kept it grey.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes," Sir, please, I must located the disk with my friend's brain on it."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Number 1.0, Very well. But your bureaucratic licence will be revoked if you fail to sort the master in pile by closing time  1pm.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Leela, That's only four minutes from now.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes, Requisition me a beat.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,[Number 1.0 plays some music and Hermes slides down a tube onto the in pile.],

How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Bender," I'm Bender, baby! Please insert liquor!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry, Yeah!
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Zoidberg, Congratulations.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Number 1.0, Congratulations indeed but you finished with one second to spare so I'm demoting you. A good bureaucrat never finishes early.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Amy," That's OK, Hermes. At least we have you back."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan," Not yet you don't. I'm still acting bureaucrat of Planet Express. And I have some changes to make. First, Fry, you're fired. Second--"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes, Not so fast! While I was sorting I came upon a certain document filed by one Morgan Proctor. Form B  Notification of Romantic Entanglement.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry," That's right, she fraternised me!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan, That form isn't about you. It refers to my high school prom date. It was a regulation date that ended in regulation disappointment.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes," Yes, but you only stamped it four times!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Morgan, No! No! I was young and reckless.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Number 1.0," Bureaucrat Conrad, you are technically correct -- the best kind of correct. I hereby promote you to grade 37. [He changes Hermes' badge to 37. He points at Morgan.] And as for you. [shouting] Guards! [Guards surround Morgan.] [talking] Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Farnsworth," Well, it looks like I'll be needing my heroic bureaucrat back. At severely-reduced pay, of course."
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,LaBarbara, It's better than nothing.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Fry, What about me? Can I come back at severely-reduced pay?
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Hermes," You got it, mon! In fact, severely-reduced pay all around! [The staff cheer and Hermes hops on a slow-mobile.] Come on, wife, let's blow this joint!"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Zoidberg," Now it's time for my song! [singing] When I was two, there was a tidal wave in--"
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,Zoidberg, [over credits] Aw.
How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,,
The Deep South,Hermes," Exciting news, people! The pet licence I requisitioned for Nibbler has arrived."
The Deep South,Leela," Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know you cared about Nibbler."
The Deep South,Hermes," Dream on, woman. I'd like to put the little bastard in a sack and toss the sack in a river and hurl the river into space. But I do like filling out requisitions and these were some doozies! [He opens the envelope.] Great Jah's dreadlocks! There's been a mix-up. This isn't a pet licence, it's a fishing licence. And it's mandatory!"
The Deep South,Farnsworth, Ah! The exact centre of the Atlantic Ocean. This seems the logical place for fish to congregate.
The Deep South,Bender, So we're in international waters?
The Deep South,Farnsworth, Indeed so.
The Deep South,Bender," Falcon, this is Blue Raven, the goose has nested. Repeat, the goose has nested. [A speedboat pulls up next to the ship and a man hands Bender a package which he puts in his chest cabinet. The speedboat pulls away and Bender turns to Fry and Farnsworth who haven't noticed anything.] Hey, guess what you're accessories to?"
The Deep South,Leela," The sun, the sea air, good friends."
The Deep South,Bender," Leela's right, fishing blows. Whattya say we make it interesting?"
The Deep South,Hermes, Why not?
The Deep South,Amy, Yeah.
The Deep South,Farnsworth," Yeah, cool."
The Deep South,Bender," Everybody kick in five bucks. [Everyone except Zoidberg hands him $5.] There, wasn't that interesting?"
The Deep South,Leela, Bender!
The Deep South,Fry, This contest is as good as over. I once caught a fish this big.
The Deep South,Bender," Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish this big!"
The Deep South,Leela," I'm afraid you're both out of your league, boys, 'cause you're looking at a woman who owns her own harpoon."
The Deep South,Bender," Harpoon, my ass!"
The Deep South,Leela, OK.
The Deep South,Hermes," Let's see now, which bait to use? [Zoidberg looks up.] Crickets? Squid? Chicken necks?"
The Deep South,Zoidberg," Excuse me, if I might be so bold, I'm willing to offer my services as a bait critic. [He eats a sardine.] These sardines for example are bland and tasteless. [He eats a few more.] And these dry, stringy night crawlers, though juicy ... [He eats a few.] ... very, very juicy--"
The Deep South,Hermes," I don't believe this! It's eating my bait! [He picks up his fishing rod and hits Zoidberg with it.] Beat it, you mooching crawdad!"
The Deep South,Bender," Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided fishing rod."
The Deep South,Fry," [whispering] Quiet, Bender, you're scaring away the fish."
The Deep South,Bender, Fine. I'll head over to the other side. [He leans over the side of the ship.] [shouting] Good luck fishing on this side!
The Deep South,Fry, I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards!
The Deep South,Bender," Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!"
The Deep South,Fry, A shrimp? [Bender's laser guide appears between Fry's eyes.] I find it a bit hard to believe that--
The Deep South,Leela," Aha! [She throws the harpoon and starts pulling it in.] Gather round, chumps! I got the winner!"
The Deep South,Amy," Oh, so this is where you shop for your boots?"
The Deep South,Bender, Couple more of those and you'll have yourself a fish stick!
The Deep South,Fry," Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's bigger than anything you've caught. [He laughs and bends over. Bender hits him with his fishing rod again.] Ow! My small intestine!"
The Deep South,Leela," Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times heavier than a boot."
The Deep South,Farnsworth, You'll never catch anything with that primitive technology. What you need is this fish pheromone. [He pulls out a spray can.] The most potent aphrodisiac known to fishkind. [He shakes the can and tries to spray it on his line but he is holding it the wrong way so it sprays back in his face.] Uh-oh!
The Deep South,Zoidberg, [sexfully] I'm so into you!
The Deep South,Farnsworth," Oh, my!"
The Deep South,Fry," [shouting] Hey, Bender, I just caught a fish this big!"
The Deep South,Bender," Quit exaggerating, Fry. Ah, screw this! [He throws his fishing rod in the bin.] If I'm not gonna catch a fish, I might as well not catch a big fish. [He takes Amy's parasol and bends it to make a giant fish hook.] There. Like most of life's problems this one can be solved with bending."
The Deep South,Farnsworth," Bender, be careful. That's the ship's diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable."
The Deep South,Bender, Then why do I have to be careful?
The Deep South,Farnsworth, It belonged to my grandmother.
The Deep South,Hermes, My Manwich!
The Deep South,Leela," Wake up, everyone! I've got something. And this time it's alive! [She pulls out another boot with Zoidberg on the end of it and groans.] Dr. Zoidberg, since when do you even wear boots?"
The Deep South,Zoidberg, I wasn't wearing it. [ashamed] I was eating it.
The Deep South,Leela," Come on, let's go home."
The Deep South,Amy, Sunburn! My fabulous body! It's ruined! What happened to my parasol?
The Deep South,Bender, I don't know. It wasn't here when I took your umbrella. [Amy growls.] What? I put sunblock on you.
The Deep South,Amy, Well it didn't work!
The Deep South,Leela," Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and let's go."
The Deep South,Bender," Hey, I'm snagged."
The Deep South,Farnsworth," It's not snagged, the mechano man has caught something! [Bender struggles to pull in the line. A huge shadow looms towards the ship from the water.] Sweet Zombie Jesus! It's huge!"
The Deep South,Amy, It's coming up!
The Deep South,Hermes," Oh, that's big!"
The Deep South,Farnsworth, A colossal-mouth bass!
The Deep South,Fry, It's diving!
The Deep South,Leela, It's pulling us under! Everyone into the ship!
The Deep South,Zoidberg," Wait! I'll save us! By cutting the unbreakable diamond filament! [He snips at the tether with his claw but it doesn't break.] Well, at least I'll die with my friends. Hello?"
The Deep South,Hermes, [from ship] My Speedos!
The Deep South,Leela," Depth at 45 hundred feet, 48 hundred, 50 hundred! 5000 feet!"
The Deep South,Farnsworth," Dear Lord, that's over 150 atmospheres of pressure."
The Deep South,Fry, How many atmospheres can this ship withstand?
The Deep South,Farnsworth," Well it's a spaceship, so I'd say anywhere between zero and one."
The Deep South,Bender, What's that? Is someone bending girders?
The Deep South,Leela, We'll be crushed if we don't equalise the pressure.
The Deep South,Fry, How do we do that?
The Deep South,Farnsworth, That should do it.
The Deep South,Amy, We're all gonna die!
The Deep South,Fry," Wait, I'll be back in a minute."
The Deep South,Leela," You did it, Fry!"
The Deep South,Fry, Did what?
The Deep South,Bender," People, it's far, far worse than we thought; my fish got away."
The Deep South,Leela," There. Good as new! Except we're three miles below the surface, we don't have any food and the ship won't work underwater."
The Deep South,Bender, [restrained] Tempers are wearing thin. Let's just hope some robot doesn't kill everybody.
The Deep South,Hermes," The important thing is that we don't panic. There are rules for situations like this. [He holds up the Code of Conduct for Cannibalism book.] Now, the first order of business is lunch. I suggest a nice lobster Zoidberg-- I mean lobster Newburg-- I mean Doctor Zoidberg."
The Deep South,Leela," OK, everyone, calm down. The Professor and I will get to work on the ship. Bender, Zoidberg, since you can survive underwater, you'll go out and look for food."
The Deep South,Fry, I'd better go too. They don't know what I like.
The Deep South,Hermes," Fry, no! The pressure will crush you like a green snake under a sugar cane truck."
The Deep South,Farnsworth, Not necessarily. This is chance for Fry to test out my experimental anti-pressure pill.
The Deep South,Fry, I can't swallow that.
The Deep South,Farnsworth, Well then good news! It's a suppository.
The Deep South,Zoidberg," How are you doing there, Fry? [Fry blubbers.] Glad to hear it. [He picks up another fish.] Aha!"
The Deep South,Bender," Aw, yeah!"
The Deep South,Zoidberg," Yum, yum, yum! [He eats it, not realising it is the top of a large pilot fish.] Uh-oh! [The fish chases him and Zoidberg woops and hides in a shell. The fish passes him and he scuttles back to Fry and Bender with the shell on his back.] Look at me, I'm Dr. Zoidberg, homeowner!"
The Deep South,Zoidberg," Careful, Fry, I think that flag might be poisonous."
The Deep South,Bender," Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us some hearty grog. [He opens the bottle and tries to drink what is in it but the liquid just drips out and trails away from him in the ocean current.] Arr! The laws o' science be a harsh mistress!"
The Deep South,Zoidberg," Say, robot, old buddy? Could you help me move a couch?"
The Deep South,Bender," Uh, OK, but I'm not carrying it upstairs."
The Deep South,Zoidberg," What is it, Fry?"
The Deep South,Fry, [blubbering] I think I saw a mermaid.
The Deep South,Bender, You want some lemonade? You saw a big parade?
The Deep South,Zoidberg," Your student loans have been repaid? Then how 'bout lending your old pal Zoidberg a few bucks, Mr. Millionaire!"
The Deep South,Leela," Fry, swallow your food. Then talk."
The Deep South,Fry, A mermaid!
The Deep South,Amy, You think you saw a mermaid?
The Deep South,Fry," No, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing a tube top and she had a beautiful scaly tail. And I think she had hair extensions."
The Deep South,Bender," Yeah, right!"
The Deep South,Leela, Sure she did.
The Deep South,Hermes," OK, Fry!"
The Deep South,Farnsworth," You're simply hallucinating, you ... moron."
The Deep South,Fry," What's so far-fetched about mermaids? I mean, there's all sorts of weird sea creatures here in the future. Like Dr. Zoidberg."
The Deep South,Leela, I'm afraid Fry is suffering from ocean madness.
The Deep South,Fry," Every time something good happens to me you say it's some kind of madness, or I'm drunk, or I ate too much candy. Well I saw a real mermaid and I wish for once my friends would have decency and kindness to believe me."
The Deep South,Leela, [whispering] Ocean madness.
The Deep South,Farnsworth, He may have ocean madness but that's no excuse for ocean rudeness.
The Deep South,Fry," [muttering] Ocean madness. Yeah, right. It's always something, ain't it? [The mermaid knocks on the window and Fry gasps.] [talking] It's her! Bender, wake up! She's here! Wake up! [Bender turns up the volume on himself and snores louder. The mermaid beckons Fry. He heads for the door then remembers something.] Oh! oxygen!"
The Deep South,Mermaid," Here you go, darlin'."
The Deep South,Fry," Hey! I can breath and talk, just like a fish!"
The Deep South,Mermaid," Oh, you speak fish?"
The Deep South,Fry, What?
The Deep South,Mermaid," I'm sorry, my accent's atrocious. Hi, my name's Umbriel!"
The Deep South,Fry," I'm Fry. So, uh, am I gonna drown?"
The Deep South,Umbriel, Course not. Just stay calm and let the currents relax your every muscle.
The Deep South,Fry," Aw, yeah!"
The Deep South,Umbriel, Did it just get warmer?
The Deep South,Fry, I can't believe you're really real. I like your tail.
The Deep South,Umbriel," Oh, you're sweet. I like those wiggly doo-dads comin' outta your hips."
The Deep South,Fry," Oh, thanks. They're called pants."
The Deep South,Umbriel, This here's a volcanic vent. The water comes out at over 4000 degrees.
The Deep South,Fry, No kidding.
The Deep South,Umbriel, Did it just get colder? [Fry jabs some shrimps with a stick and toasts them over the vent.] Tell me more about that bizarre land-y world you come from. Is there water there too?
The Deep South,Fry, Sure. Sometimes it falls from the sky.
The Deep South,Umbriel, Hm.
The Deep South,Fry, And sometimes it doesn't.
The Deep South,Umbriel," Oh, Mr. Fry! You do go on!"
The Deep South,Fry," You know what I like best about you, Umbriel? You find me fascinating even when I'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or a lion tamer."
The Deep South,Umbriel, Lions? There are sealions on the land?
The Deep South,Fry, Yup. We call them land-sealions ... I tame them!
The Deep South,Farnsworth, I'm almost finish reconfiguring the ships propulsion system. We can leave as soon as the paper-mâché is dry.
The Deep South,Leela, Where's Fry?
The Deep South,Bender, I didn't kill him. Professor?
The Deep South,Farnsworth," No, I've been busy."
The Deep South,Hermes," He must've gone out looking for that mermaid. The poor, demented honky."
The Deep South,Leela," It's ocean madness alright. Sailors call it aqua dementia, the deep-down crazies, the wet willies, the screaming moist!"
The Deep South,Farnsworth," We'll form a search party. Now, we'll need oxygen."
The Deep South,Bender," I got it covered. [He opens his chest cabinet and the crew take out some oxygen masks and put them on.] In the event of an emergency, my ass can be used as a floatation device."
The Deep South,Farnsworth," Ooh, that reminds me  You've all taken your pressure pills, right?"
The Deep South,Amy, Yes! Stop asking!
The Deep South,Zoidberg, I've got his scent! Over here where the water gets warmer. This way!
The Deep South,Bender, [awestruck] Bend me!
The Deep South,Amy, Dude! An ancient sunken city!
The Deep South,Farnsworth," Could it possibly be? Are the old legends true? [Leela rubs away the flora from the sign, revealing ""City Of Atlanta"". The staff gasp.] It is! It's the fabled lost city of Atlanta!"
The Deep South,Merman," Howdy, y'all!"
The Deep South,Colonel," Welcome to Atlanta. Folks round these parts call me the Colonel. [Bender hums Dueling Banjos.] Here, have some breathers, courtesy of our Chamber of Commerce."
The Deep South,Farnsworth," This is uncomfortable and humiliating. Now, if they could put it in the form of a suppository."
The Deep South,Colonel," Y'all enjoy your stay! Tourism's our main source of income round here so see the sights, spend some money. Please don't leave!"
The Deep South,Bender," Fry! Oh, I just knew you were still alive! [whispering] I owe you 10 bucks, Hermes!"
The Deep South,Fry," Hey, you guys, the most amazing thing happened. It's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy Kreme! Plus there's mermaids."
The Deep South,Colonel," Nice out of town folks, I'd like you to meet my daughter, Umbriel. Umbriel, these are some Yankees."
The Deep South,Amy," So, Fry, Atlanta was an American city in your time?"
The Deep South,Fry, I think it was just an airport. They had a place where you could buy nuts.
The Deep South,Umbriel," No! Ancient Atlanta was more than just a Delta hub. It was a vibrant metropolis, the equal of Paris or New York."
The Deep South,Fry," That's right, honey! Whatever you say."
The Deep South,Umbriel," Look at these fabulous ruins. Turner Field, the Coca-Cola bottling plant, the, uh, the airport."
The Deep South,Leela," But tell us, how could a city with such a ... fabulous airport end up underwater?"
The Deep South,Colonel," Ah, now that's a story that can only rightly be told in a Chamber of Commerce video narrated by folk-rock troubadour Donovan."
The Deep South,Donovan," [on screen] Atlanta was a city, landlocked,"
The Deep South,"Hundreds of miles from the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean,",
The Deep South,"Yet so desperate the city's desire for tourism,",
The Deep South,"That they moved offshore, becoming an island,",
The Deep South,"And an even bigger Delta hub,",
The Deep South,Donovan, [on screen] until the city overdeveloped
The Deep South,And it started to sink.,
The Deep South,"Knowing their fate, the quality people ran away,",
The Deep South,"Ted Turner, Hank Aaron, Jeff Foxworthy,",
The Deep South,"The Guy Who Invented Coca-Cola, the Magician,",
The Deep South,"And the other so-called gods of our legends,",
The Deep South,Though gods they were--,
The Deep South,"And also, Jane Fonda was there.",
The Deep South,Donovan, The others chose to remain behind
The Deep South,"On their porches with their rifles,",
The Deep South,"And one day evolve into mermaids,",
The Deep South,"And sing and dance,",
The Deep South,And ring in the new.,
The Deep South,Mermaids, [on screen] Hail Atlanta!
The Deep South,Leela, The magician?
The Deep South,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wouldn't it take millions of years to evolve into mermaids?"
The Deep South,Umbriel," Normally, yes, but the caffeine really sped things up. [She points at a leak in the Coca-Cola factory.] That stuff's wonderful."
The Deep South,Colonel," So when Umbriel first brought home this carpet bagger, I was again' it. But, damnit, if Old Legs here ain't grown on me!"
The Deep South,Fry," Aw, shucks, Colonel."
The Deep South,Hermes," Well, it's all very nice here but we should be going. I miss me wife and me oxygen."
The Deep South,Farnsworth," Yes, we all miss our loved ones and gases. Come on, Fry."
The Deep South,Fry, Wait. I'm not going with you.
The Deep South,Leela," But, Fry, what about us? What about your life on the surface? You don't belong down here."
The Deep South,Zoidberg," She's right, I mean, sure, they got the Braves but it's a third-rate symphony."
The Deep South,Farnsworth," Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac, be reasonable. Don't you realise that if you stay at this depth your body will permanently adapt to the pressure?"
The Deep South,Fry, Realise it? I don't even understand it!
The Deep South,Farnsworth, It means you'll never be able to return to the surface.
The Deep South,Fry, I don't care. I'm staying. I've got everything I want right here.
The Deep South,Farnsworth, [shouting] I'm bored! Let's go!
The Deep South,Zoidberg," You know, Fry, I've got a little place just outside town. You could come visit, maybe?"
The Deep South,Fry," Sorry, Zoidberg. I'm trying to join the country club."
The Deep South,Bender," [crying] Oh, Fry! [He bawls.] I'll miss you!"
The Deep South,Colonel," Y'all come back now, y'hear?"
The Deep South,Farnsworth," [shouting] Let's go, damnit! Let's go!"
The Deep South,Zoidberg," Well, I guess this is goodbye for me as well."
The Deep South,Leela, Whatever.
The Deep South,Amy, Later.
The Deep South,Farnsworth, Bye.
The Deep South,Zoidberg, No! My home! It burned down! [Hermes and Bender walk out of the ship. Zoidberg cries.] [crying] How did this happen?
The Deep South,Hermes, That's a very good question.
The Deep South,Bender, So that's where I left my cigar.
The Deep South,Hermes, That just raises further questions!
The Deep South,Fry," You know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours have been the happiest days of my life."
The Deep South,Umbriel," Oh, Fry! I want you to make a mer-woman outta mer-me."
The Deep South,Fry, Mercy! I do believe I'm gettin' the vapours!
The Deep South,Umbriel, What the hell is that?
The Deep South,Fry, Yeah I'm a little confused too. How do I ... y'know ... with the tail and all?
The Deep South,Umbriel," I'm not your first am I? I mean, I-I lay my eggs and leave and you release your fertiliser."
The Deep South,Fry," [gasping] Why couldn't she be the other type of mermaid, with the fish part on top and the lady part on the bottom?"
The Deep South,Umbriel, Now who's gonna escort me to the Debutante Ball?
The Deep South,Colonel," Well what about that rich, young dugong from Macon?"
The Deep South,Farnsworth, There! The engine modifications are complete.
The Deep South,Leela, Prepare for launch.
The Deep South,Fry, Wait! Wait for me! Don't leave me here!
The Deep South,Poopenmeyer," And so, in honour of his record-breaking catch, I'm proud to award Bender this cheque for $1000."
The Deep South,Leela, It's you!
The Deep South,Bender," Hey, buddy!"
The Deep South,Hermes, My Manwich!
The Deep South,Leela," Fry, are you alright? What happened?"
The Deep South,Amy, What about Umbriel?
The Deep South,Fry," Well, it turns out I loved her, but I wasn't in love with her."
The Deep South,Amy, [whispering] Trouble in bed.
The Deep South,Bender," Ah, it's great to have you back, buddy."
The Deep South,Poopenmeyer, Wait a-- This is no record! Gimme back that cheque! I'm giving it to some giant orphans.
The Deep South,Fry," Ow! Bender, you're hurting me. Ow!"
The Deep South,Zoidberg, Hey! I'm trying to sleep in here!
The Deep South,Donovan, [over credits] Hail Atlanta!
The Deep South,,
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Wow! I'm finally gonna see my favourite chef, TV's Elzar. Oh this is the greatest nanosecond of my life. No, this one is-- No, this one. Wait ... that one was slightly worse. Ah, so far, so good on this one."
Bender Gets Made,Announcer," [on loudspeaker] And now, here he is  Chef, restaurateur, author of Cooking Slugs For Dinner and Cooking Dinner For Slugs ... Elzar!"
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Yeah! [Above them Elzar flies in on a jet pack and lands at the back of the studio.] Alright! Yeah, yeah, baby!"
Bender Gets Made,Man," Elzar! [Elzar passes a centipede-like alien wearing a ""Knock It Up A Notch"" T-shirt.] Alright!"
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Elzar, you're my God. Please sign this sketch I drew of you. [He holds up a crude picture of himself staring lovey-eyed at Elzar. Elzar takes it stamps ""I'll Sign This For $50.00. x___"" on it and hands it back to Bender.] [crying] Oh, Elzar! Bless you!"
Bender Gets Made,Elzar, Now this is why I prefer your non-stick robots.
Bender Gets Made,Bender," [disappointed] Oh. [The audience claps and cheers.] [normal] Alright, yeah! [The ""Applause"" sign changes to ""Less Applause"".] [quietly] Alright, yeah!"
Bender Gets Made,Elzar," Hey, I hope you folks like Cajun food. [Bender hoots.] 'Cause today we're making Elzar's down-home Neptune-style gumbo. Now, step one. You wanna boil some oysters in a pot of down-home Neptune-style gumbo."
Bender Gets Made,Bender, [loudly] Boiled? Interesting.
Bender Gets Made,Leela," [whispering] Bender, please try to be a little quieter."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," No, you shut up."
Bender Gets Made,Elzar," Of course, every now and then you'll wanna knock it up a notch with a blast from your spice weasel. [He takes one out and squeezes it.] Bam!"
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Oh, yeah! Bam it again, Elzar! Knock it up another notch!"
Bender Gets Made,Elzar," Jeez, who let this guy through the metal detector?"
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Come on, you wimp! Work that weasel! Quit holding out on us."
Bender Gets Made,Elzar," If you promise to stop interrupting, alright. Against my will, I'm gonna knock it up another notch."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," I gotta get this notch-up-knocking on film. [He stands up.] Hey, Elzar, think fast."
Bender Gets Made,Elzar," What, huh?"
Bender Gets Made,Leela, Ow! My eye! I'm blind!
Bender Gets Made,Bender, Bam!
Bender Gets Made,Hattie," Tell me, doctor, how's my cyst?"
Bender Gets Made,Taco Bellevue Doctor, Grande.
Bender Gets Made,Zoidberg, I don't like the looks of this doctor. I bet I've lost more patients than he's even treated.
Bender Gets Made,Doctor #2, OK. What does this look like to you?
Bender Gets Made,Leela, Um ... a grey-ish blob?
Bender Gets Made,Doctor #2, Right. [He swaps the blob with a picture of a toucan playing tennis.] And this one?
Bender Gets Made,Leela, Um ... a grey-ish blob?
Bender Gets Made,Doctor #2, Not as right that time. It looks like you might have some mild corneal irritation.
Bender Gets Made,Zoidberg," Nice try, little boy. You may have your textbook knowledge and your real diploma but I have more skill in my little claw than you have in your whole carapace!"
Bender Gets Made,Doctor #2," You seem a bit tense. [He tips some pills onto his hand.] Here, try these."
Bender Gets Made,Zoidberg," Sure, butter me up with candy. But it won't work, sonny! [He slurps the pills off the doctor's hand and his pupils dilate.] [high] Why always the fighting?"
Bender Gets Made,Doctor #2, Your eye just needs some rest. You'll have to wear this patch for about a week.
Bender Gets Made,Leela," A week? What do you think, Dr. Zoidberg?"
Bender Gets Made,Zoidberg, [high] Clack.
Bender Gets Made,Zoidberg," [high] Thanks for the help, Leela."
Bender Gets Made,Amy," [shouting] Leela, we're right here."
Bender Gets Made,Leela, I'm not deaf. I just have to wear this stupid eye patch. Does it look stupid?
Bender Gets Made,Fry," No! In fact, it looks so nice I think I might get one too."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," It's Elzar again! Oh, my God, I'm so excited, I wish I could wet my pants!"
Bender Gets Made,Elzar," Leela, please, let me make this up to you. You and your friends are all invited to my restaurant tonight. I'm gonna bam you up a dinner you'll never forget."
Bender Gets Made,Amy, [cheering] Alright!
Bender Gets Made,Fry, [cheering] Yeah!
Bender Gets Made,Bender, [cheering] Hooray for blind-y!
Bender Gets Made,Zoidberg," Oh, God! I'm coming down!"
Bender Gets Made,Elzar," Folks, tell the neighbours to watch your mouth 'cause your taste buds are going on vacation. I made you each your own special meal, so dig in!"
Bender Gets Made,Hermes," It's the biggest Jamaican platter I've ever seen. Jerk chicken, jerk beef, jerk pork. Is there any meat this man can't jerk?"
Bender Gets Made,Zoidberg, The king crab is to die for. Look! A tiny edible crown.
Bender Gets Made,Amy, What's it made of?
Bender Gets Made,Zoidberg, [eating] Wood!
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Oh, Fry, you gotta try this sterno-nicoise!"
Bender Gets Made,Fry," No, thanks. That's robot food."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," It's so good. Oh, just try a little!"
Bender Gets Made,Fry," No, really, I don't-- [Bender stuffs a spoonful in his mouth and he screams as his tongue catches fire. The flame goes out and Fry tastes it and smiles.] Mmm!"
Bender Gets Made,Amy," Are you doing alright over there, Leela?"
Bender Gets Made,Leela," Oh, yeah, this salad's fantastic. [She takes a forkful of flowers from the middle of the table.] So fresh."
Bender Gets Made,Farnsworth," Oh, my. That steamed carrot was a bit spicy for me."
Bender Gets Made,Elzar, Everybody enjoy their dinner?
Bender Gets Made,Leela, Are you kidding me?
Bender Gets Made,Amy, Uh-huh.
Bender Gets Made,Bender," God, yes, Elzar."
Bender Gets Made,Elzar," Well, I enjoyed cooking for you. And to make everything completely square, I want you to have these complimentary after-dinner chocolates."
Bender Gets Made,Hermes, What's this under the chocolates?
Bender Gets Made,Elzar," Yeah, you take care of that whenever you want."
Bender Gets Made,Hermes, Hey.
Bender Gets Made,Amy, A bill?
Bender Gets Made,Leela, You're charging us? After you blinded me?
Bender Gets Made,Elzar," Hey, I made you a nice meal. This ain't a charity."
Bender Gets Made,Fry, $1200?
Bender Gets Made,Farnsworth, Holy Zombie Jesus!
Bender Gets Made,Hermes, We don't have that kind of money. Especially not Zoidberg.
Bender Gets Made,Zoidberg, They took away my credit card.
Bender Gets Made,Elzar," OK, OK, wait. I know how to take care of this, no problem."
Bender Gets Made,URL, You deadbeats are under arrest. It's a stone cold shame.
Bender Gets Made,Smitty, He's making a break for it. Get him!
Bender Gets Made,Fry, No! No! I was just picking my nose.
Bender Gets Made,Smitty, He's picking his nose. Get him!
Bender Gets Made,Smitty," The old dine-and-dash, huh? My daddy owned a restaurant and it's punks like you who kept it from going regional. That's why I became a cop."
Bender Gets Made,URL," Now it's payback time. Aw, yeah!"
Bender Gets Made,Zoidberg, Please don't hit me. I'm brittle!
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Hey, wait a second. I've got the perfect solution."
Bender Gets Made,Zoidberg, Listen to the smart robot.
Bender Gets Made,Bender," I love cooking and Elzar's ass loves getting kissed, right?"
Bender Gets Made,Elzar, No question.
Bender Gets Made,Bender," So, how 'bout I work part-time at the restaurant to pay off our debt?"
Bender Gets Made,Elzar, I don't know. I usually hire people who are a little less unbearable.
Bender Gets Made,Hermes," Oh, Bender's a model employee."
Bender Gets Made,Amy, He's so polite.
Bender Gets Made,Leela, And hard-working.
Bender Gets Made,Fry, He's made of candy.
Bender Gets Made,Elzar," OK, fine, I'll give it a shot."
Bender Gets Made,Fry, [cheering] Alright!
Bender Gets Made,Hermes, [cheering] Yes!
Bender Gets Made,Bender, Hot diggety!
Bender Gets Made,Smitty, You'd better keep your nose clean.
Bender Gets Made,Bender, That'll be easy. I never wear the damn thing.
Bender Gets Made,Hermes, Ah! Time for my precious 10am meeting. [He looks around the table.] Where in Legoland is Leela?
Bender Gets Made,Leela," I'm here and I'm getting along just fine, thank you. My walk to work today just took a little longer than usual. Nibbler took me through the zoo for some reason."
Bender Gets Made,Amy," Leela, a little help is nothing to be embarrassed about. Like, maybe I could do your makeup."
Bender Gets Made,Leela, I don't need help. For your information I did this all by myself.
Bender Gets Made,Farnsworth," You look beautiful. Incidentally, my favourite artist is Picasso."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Well, I'm off to work at the restaurant. One of you will have to fill in for me while I'm gone."
Bender Gets Made,Farnsworth," Better yet, I'll build someone to fill in for you. [He gets up and heads for the door.] Some kind of gamma-powered mechanical monster, with freeway on-ramps for arms and a heart as black as coal..."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Well, if that new guy can't handle things, gimme a call."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," I'm done siphoning out the grease trap. I think I need a mint. [He takes a mint from a bowl and leaves grease over the rest of them.] So, uh, what job do I move up to? Pastry chef? Saucier? Soup guy?"
Bender Gets Made,Elzar, Bam!
Bender Gets Made,Bender," [muttering] Bam yourself! [The door opens and three robots walk in. One of them is short, has a scar on his face and clamps instead of hands, another wears a hat, cloak and carries a cane and the third, the tallest, wears a chain around his neck with a computer mouse attached to it. The lead robot hands his hat to the one with the clamps and his cloak to the one with the mouse. A waitress shows them through.] [talking] Hey, who are they?"
Bender Gets Made,Elzar, Let's just say they're very good customers and I'm not answering anymore questions.
Bender Gets Made,Bender, Are they the Robot Mafia?
Bender Gets Made,Elzar, Yes.
Bender Gets Made,Donbot, You call this a table? You call this a table? I wouldn't hit a guy over the head with this table.
Bender Gets Made,Clamps, You hear that? The Donbot don't like it. I oughta clamp you. You wanna be clamped?
Bender Gets Made,Joey," Whoa! Whoa! Calm down, Clamps. [He turns to the waitress.] The boss, he likes a wall up which his back can be put against. Such as like this there."
Bender Gets Made,Waitress, But that table's already--
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Ah, let me bus that for you, gentlemen. [He walks over to the table and pulls the tablecloth away, leaving the plates and glasses undisturbed. The family applauds.] No, what I meant to do was--"
Bender Gets Made,Woman, Oh!
Bender Gets Made,Man, I can't believe this!
Bender Gets Made,Bender, Mind your own business and get out!
Bender Gets Made,Donbot, Huh. I like this guy's lack of style.
Bender Gets Made,Clamps, So I finally get this guy a pair of cement shoes which he likes 'cause they're lighter than his lead ones.
Bender Gets Made,Donbot, Hey! You think this computes over here? Where's all my change? I gave you a hundred.
Bender Gets Made,Bender," No, you gave me a fifty."
Bender Gets Made,Donbot," Oh, no I didn't."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Yeah, you did."
Bender Gets Made,Clamps," Hey, you tryin' to steal from the Donbot?"
Bender Gets Made,Bender, I'm tryin' but he's not makin' it easy.
Bender Gets Made,Donbot," Get a load of the ball bearings on this guy, huh. I like you, kid. Here's something for your trouble. [He slips something into Bender's apron pocket.] [whispering] It's money."
Bender Gets Made,Bender, Wow! Thanks.
Bender Gets Made,Donbot," Hey, you earned that 50 bucks."
Bender Gets Made,Bender, You gave me a twenty.
Bender Gets Made,Donbot," I did? [He starts counting out some extra cash.] Oh, I'm sorry, I meant to-- Hey, wait a minute. [He laughs.] I got a good feeling about you. Say, you wanna work for me as a hired goon?"
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Are you kidding? I've always wanted to break into gooning! [He takes off his apron, screws it up and throws it on the floor.] [shouting] Hey, Elzar! I quit!"
Bender Gets Made,Elzar, [shouting; from foyer] K.
Bender Gets Made,Donbot," We're gonna try you out with a little delivery job. It's for a, uh, private lottery that we run."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Wow, you guys run numbers?"
Bender Gets Made,Clamps," Well, nothing fancy, y'know. Ones and zeros mostly."
Bender Gets Made,Donbot," Just take this disk over to the pool hall and give it to Sammy ""The Mechanical Bull"" Gravano. And watch out for the cops."
Bender Gets Made,Bender, That's just what my mom used to tell me.
Bender Gets Made,Bender," That's some fine oil-ade, son. We could use a man like you in the Robot Mafia, which I'm sorta in."
Bender Gets Made,Tinny Tim," You flatter me, kind goon. But I'm only programmed to sell oil-ade and write in cute backwards letters like on the sign here."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Aw, crap! The cops!"
Bender Gets Made,Smitty, Seen any suspicious activity?
Bender Gets Made,URL, Nope. But check out today's Marmaduke. Solid!
Bender Gets Made,Smitty, Hey! It's that skell from Elzar's.
Bender Gets Made,URL, Undercover pursuit in progress ... baby.
Bender Gets Made,Smitty, Gotcha!
Bender Gets Made,Bender," What seems to be the problem, officers? Was I speeding?"
Bender Gets Made,Smitty, We'll decide what you were doing after an illegal search.
Bender Gets Made,URL, He's clean. [He closes the door.] Smells nice too.
Bender Gets Made,Smitty, Better than me?
Bender Gets Made,URL," Aw, yeah."
Bender Gets Made,Tinny Tim, Courtesy of Mr. Bender.
Bender Gets Made,Donbot," Nice job, Bender. You passed the test. You wanna join me, Clamps and Joey Mouse Pad at our, uh, social club tomorrow night?"
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Uh, I'd rather plan some felonies."
Bender Gets Made,Donbot, Oh. Then we should meet at our Mafia crime headquarters.
Bender Gets Made,Robot," Donbot, I beg you, I can't make this week's loan payment. Look into your hard drive and open your mercy file."
Bender Gets Made,Donbot," File not found. [Clamps and Joey take out some laser-Tommy guns and shoot the robot, riddling him with laser holes. He screams and falls to the floor.] Let that be a warning to you."
Bender Gets Made,Robot," Thank you, Donbot."
Bender Gets Made,Bender, Joey! Clamps! Donny B!
Bender Gets Made,Donbot," Hey, listen, Bender. We got a big score planned but, uh, we need some muscle."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," A little of this, huh?"
Bender Gets Made,Joey," Ho! Ho! This guy's an ox! He's got oxen-like strength! Hey, he needs a nickname, right? Let's call him Clamps."
Bender Gets Made,Clamps," Clamps? That's my name, you numbskull! Don't make me clamp you one!"
Bender Gets Made,Bender," How 'bout ""Blotto""? It's gritty, it's got street cred. Plus I can keep my monogrammed slippers."
Bender Gets Made,Joey," Good thinking. Hey, hey! Now, this score ain't gonna be no cake walk in the tea park, alright? There may be some death killing."
Bender Gets Made,Clamps," It's gonna be clamp this, clamp that. Bada-climp, bada-clamp!"
Bender Gets Made,Donbot," What d'you think, Blotto? You in?"
Bender Gets Made,Bender, It's funny  Until now I always wanted to be a gangster ... so the answer's yes.
Bender Gets Made,Clamps, Yeah!
Bender Gets Made,Joey," Hey, hey! Way to go, way to be, way to shoot!"
Bender Gets Made,Donbot," Now, since we're committing crimes that may be against the law, I suggest you have an alibi."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," An alibi, huh?"
Bender Gets Made,Bender, [groaning; from quarters] I don't feel good. I'm genuinely sick.
Bender Gets Made,Fry, But we're about to take off. We gotta eat our blast-off sundaes.
Bender Gets Made,Bender, [groaning; from quarters] I can't move.
Bender Gets Made,Bender," [groaning; on tape] Oh, I think I'm gonna output."
Bender Gets Made,Fry," [from outside] OK, you stay in bed. I'll eat yours."
Bender Gets Made,Fry, Bender's sick. [Leela presses the button and the ship rises into its 45-degree launch position. Fry eats a sundae and talks with his mouth full.] Need any help taking off?
Bender Gets Made,Leela," I'm fine, thank you. A real pilot can navigate by feel alone."
Bender Gets Made,Hermes, That's coming outta your pay!
Bender Gets Made,Bender," You know the secret of traditional robot cooking? Start with a good, high-quality oil ... then eat it. So what's this big score anyway?"
Bender Gets Made,Donbot, We're heisting a shipment of Zuban cigars.
Bender Gets Made,Bender, Zubans? Those are the finest cigars in the universe. I can stink up a hole maternity ward with one of those things.
Bender Gets Made,Joey, Yo! There's our pigeon now. Let's shoot bullets out of our guns.
Bender Gets Made,Donbot," Alright, here's the battle plan  We shoot, they surrender, we go aboard, somebody does some clamping, then we heist the cigars and go home."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," And all without killing anyone. [He whistles.] This gang's got some fresh, new ideas. I admire that."
Bender Gets Made,Joey," Oh, we'll kill 'em alright."
Bender Gets Made,Clamps, We got 'em heavily out-clamped. They won't know what clamped 'em!
Bender Gets Made,Fry," Wow! It's too bad you can't see, Leela, 'cause there's a cool ship out there shooting at somebody."
Bender Gets Made,Leela, I'm taking evasive action.
Bender Gets Made,Fry," Uh, Leela?"
Bender Gets Made,Leela," Stop bothering me, Fry, I need full concentration."
Bender Gets Made,Computer Voice, Missile evaded.
Bender Gets Made,Leela, Eyesight is for chumps.
Bender Gets Made,Donbot," Their desire to keep living shows me no respect. Hey, Blotto, roll down the window and start shooting."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Um, uh, um. [He opens the window, leans out and pretends to fire the gun, making the noises. He looks back in at Donbot who doesn't turn around. He makes an explosion sound.] [fake hurt] Ooh! Ow! He got me! Ooh! What a shot that guy is!"
Bender Gets Made,Leela," Wait! Why do the raised letters that normally say ""Turn Master Steering Wheel Company"" say ""Nibbler""? Oh, no!"
Bender Gets Made,Leela," [on screen] I'm back at the wheel, Fry. Everything's under control."
Bender Gets Made,Fry," Great, great. The one time I forgot to buy flight insurance!"
Bender Gets Made,Joey," They're coming straight toward our proximity. Maybe you should give 'em the clamps, Clamps."
Bender Gets Made,Clamps," Gee, you think? You think that maybe I should use these clamps that I use every day at every opportunity? [shouting] You're a freaking genius, you idiot!"
Bender Gets Made,Leela, The engine's stalled. I'm trying the manual fuel pump.
Bender Gets Made,Donbot," Hello, we're the Robot Mafia. The entire Robot Mafia. We're here to steal your cigars."
Bender Gets Made,Leela, You'll never get away with this.
Bender Gets Made,Fry, Unless you let us live. Then you'll get off scot free.
Bender Gets Made,Donbot," Joey, Clamps, hurry and blindfold them before they see us some more."
Bender Gets Made,Joey," Hey, boss, looks like somebody beat us to it."
Bender Gets Made,Leela," I'll assume that's a joke at my expense. Well, who's laughing now? Hi-yah!"
Bender Gets Made,Donbot," Hey, where's Blotto? He should be here learning the trade."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Sorry I'm tardy, old bean. I was just enjoying a rather tasty watercress sandwich."
Bender Gets Made,Donbot, Hey. He's more classy than I realised. Tie up the prisoners.
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Capital idea, old sport. [He ties Fry to chair. Nibbler tugs his leg and points at the mobbots.] I say, get the hell off me!"
Bender Gets Made,Leela, [whispering] That guy sounds familiar.
Bender Gets Made,Bender," My word, what have we-- [He gasps. Leela stares at him. She can just about make out Bender's shape but he puts the eye patch back on her.] Uh, nothing to see here, old girl."
Bender Gets Made,Joey," Hey, boss, this here crew list lists a robot on this crew here."
Bender Gets Made,Donbot, Alright. I want you to find him and plug him. Then unplug him.
Bender Gets Made,Fry, No!
Bender Gets Made,Clamps, I got a little surprise in store for that guy  The clamps! Eh?
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Uh, wait, old ... spice. Let me have a go at this mechanised chap. I can be quite the rough customer."
Bender Gets Made,Fry," [whispering] Oh, no! Poor Bender."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," [groaning; on tape; from quarters] Oh, I don't feel good."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," [from quarters] Chew on this! [normal voice] Ooh, ah! [fake voice] What ho! [normal voice] Stop it!"
Bender Gets Made,Bender," [fake voice] Take that, you twit. [normal voice] No! Stop it!"
Bender Gets Made,Donbot," That's the last of 'em. [Joey and Clamps walk back in through the linkway.] Alright, now let's Mafia things up a little. [He takes two oil containers out of his chest cabinet.] Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Uh, hey, Donny, baby, gimme a chance here, huh? Yous guys skedaddle. Let me take care of the doity woik."
Bender Gets Made,Donbot," Hey, I like your attitude. And your latest accent. Keep it up and I might just get you your own pair of clamps, huh?"
Bender Gets Made,Clamps," [muttering] He's gonna get clamps? Clamps, clamps ... [He and Joey leave.] ... clamps, clamps!"
Bender Gets Made,Bender, Phew!
Bender Gets Made,Fry," Leela, we may not have much time left ... [Bender sneaks past them to an empty chair.] ... so let's spend all of it reminiscing about Bender. He was like a big computer that ran on magic."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Uh, help! Help!"
Bender Gets Made,Leela, Bender!
Bender Gets Made,Fry, You're OK!
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Yes, I am. Having just this minute regained consciousness."
Bender Gets Made,Leela, I've got an idea. Hold still. [She rubs her ropes against Bender's arm.] It's about to break. Yes! Yes!
Bender Gets Made,Leela, [cheering] Alright!
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Yeah that broke, alright!"
Bender Gets Made,Fry," I'm telling you, Leela was cool, she was in command, and when she kicked people it hurt. It really hurt."
Bender Gets Made,Leela," Well, this is the big moment. It's finally time to take my eye patch off."
Bender Gets Made,Zoidberg," I'll handle the snipping. After all, I do have the proper equipment."
Bender Gets Made,Leela," I think it's Blotto, that gangster I saw when my patch fell off. [Bender rubs some sweat off his head with Nibbler. Leela focuses. The shape turns into Farnsworth.] Professor? Where were you at 10pm last night?"
Bender Gets Made,Farnsworth, Where am I now?
Bender Gets Made,Bender, So they sent a helpless child to kill me? Well I'm not going out without a fight.
Bender Gets Made,Tinny Tim," Fine kick, sir. But I'm actually here to deliver your cut from the cigar heist."
Bender Gets Made,Bender," Oh, sweet legal tender! [He takes the cash and starts to eat it.] Kid, tell the Donbot I'm quitting organised crime. From now on I'll stick to regular kind."
Bender Gets Made,Fry," It's funny, Bender; with you sick and Leela blind, only I know what really went on out there. Maybe someday I'll tell you the whole story."
Bender Gets Made,Bender, And maybe someday I won't listen.
Bender Gets Made,,
Mother's Day,Linda," [on TV] And in sports, Yankees' fifth blernsman, William Wu, is out with an injured knee."
Mother's Day,Morbo," [on TV] So, humans have easily injured knees. My race will find this information very useful indeed."
Mother's Day,Linda," [on TV] And finally, today is Mother's Day; a sentimental occasion when robots honour Mom, the beloved owner of Mom's Friendly Robot Company. [The picture on the screen changes to robots buying gifts.] Across Earth, robots built in Mom's factories are buying thoughtful gifts for the sweet old tycoon who brought them into the world."
Mother's Day,Destructor, [on TV] This originates from the heart.
Mother's Day,Mom, [on TV] It's just what I wanted!
Mother's Day,Bender," Come look, everyone. I just got the dearest presents for Mommy."
Mother's Day,Leela, Very nice. Where'd you steal them?
Mother's Day,Bender," I didn't steal 'em, I bought 'em. [Everyone gasps and Fry drops the box.] I love her that much."
Mother's Day,Hermes," What did you get her, you mushy gizmo?"
Mother's Day,Bender," Oh, precious things. I found the most adorable little figurine of mice having tea. [He holds up the figure of two smartly-dressed mice at a tea table. The caption on the base reads ""A Spot of Tea, Mr. Squeaks?"" He rummages in the trolley some more.] And a framed picture of me when I was only a month old. [In the photo, he is already smoking and drinking.] But the best part is I found my exact feelings expressed in a greeting card. [The card has a picture of a sun setting over the sea on the front.] [reading]"
Mother's Day,"You created me, Mom,",
Mother's Day,"So I guess you're to blame,",
Mother's Day,"For the love that I feel,",
Mother's Day,Just from hearing your name...,
Mother's Day,[The others cringe.],
Mother's Day,"You're as tender as corned beef,",
Mother's Day,And warm as pastrami...,
Mother's Day,Greeting Card, I wuv my Mommy!
Mother's Day,Leela, So how are you gonna lug all those gifts to Mom's factory?
Mother's Day,Bender, I'll get a couple of chumps to help me.
Mother's Day,Bender," Come on, you call yourselves chumps?"
Mother's Day,Fry," Man, there's clouds of exhaust everywhere."
Mother's Day,Bender," [sly] Uh, wasn't me!"
Mother's Day,Tinny Tim, I've not much money. But I've saved my pennies all year for a gift for Mom.
Mother's Day,Bender, Upsy-daisy.
Mother's Day,Tinny Tim, Oh. [The Crushinator runs him over.] Oh!
Mother's Day,Bender," [pointing] Hey, look, the Robot Museum! You guys wanna learn about robot heritage?"
Mother's Day,Leela," Um, alright."
Mother's Day,Fry, Not really.
Mother's Day,Bender," Well, if you insist. But you're paying!"
Mother's Day,Bender," Ooh, ooh, wax replicas of the most famous robots Mom ever built!"
Mother's Day,Leela, They're so lifeless-like.
Mother's Day,Bender," [pointing] That's the world's greatest robot artist, Vincent van Gobot. He was built without an ear, but then he went crazy and had one installed."
Mother's Day,Fry," Hey, who's this guy?"
Mother's Day,Janitorbot, I'm the janitor. I'm trying to take a nap here.
Mother's Day,Fry," I'm sorry, I-I thought you were made of wax."
Mother's Day,Janitorbot," I am made of wax, what's it to you?"
Mother's Day,Fry, I mean I thought you were one of the wax robots.
Mother's Day,Janitorbot, Is there some reason a robot made of wax can't take a nap standing up in the middle of a bunch of wax robots? Or does that confuse you?
Mother's Day,Leela, [reading] See through the eyes of a bender unit. [talking] Fine.
Mother's Day,Bender," Hey, let me try. [She hands them to him. He puts them on then takes them straight off.] Whoa! That gives me a headache."
Mother's Day,Fry," Hey, Bender, here's an exhibit about Mom's favourite robot."
Mother's Day,Bender, Who is he? I'll kill him!
Mother's Day,Mom Cut-Out, Who's my favourite robot?
Mother's Day,Bender, It's me! No one else look in this mirror!
Mother's Day,Mom Cut-Out, I love each and every robot most of all.
Mother's Day,Mom, Jerkwad robots make me sick to my ass! [She presses a button on her fat suit and it disappears. The room is dominated by a large machine with conveyor belts. She turns around.] Walt? How are we disposing of these crap gifts the brought me?
Mother's Day,Walt, They're being crushed into powder and sold as a hocus-pocus cure for cancer.
Mother's Day,Mom," False hope, I love it! Larry! What about all the retch-inducing Mother's Day cards?"
Mother's Day,Larry, The machine is working at full capacity.
Mother's Day,Igner, Mommy? Why do the robots give you presents?
Mother's Day,Mom," [shouting] Shove a big old melon in it, I'm talking!"
Mother's Day,Igner, Ow!
Mother's Day,Mom, You've noticed I design all my robots with antennas. Everyone thinks it's just to make them more science-fiction-y. But the antennas are really for my universal robot controller!
Mother's Day,Larry, So they do whatever you want? No wonder you love Mother's Day.
Mother's Day,Mom," [shouting] I hate Mother's Day, you dribbling pukes! [talking] It brings back awful memories. But, so help me, this year everyone will hate it as much as I do."
Mother's Day,Walt," Someday, I want to marry a girl like her."
Mother's Day,Mom," [on TV] Hello, everyone. It's time for my annual private get-together with my robot children."
Mother's Day,Bender, I'm her favourite.
Mother's Day,Leela," Well, see you back at the office. And don't forget to tell your Mom you love her."
Mother's Day,Bender, Any jerk can tell her! Bender has a little more up his sleeve.
Mother's Day,Greeting Card, I wuv my Mommy.
Mother's Day,Mom," Hello, dearies."
Mother's Day,Robot #1," Hi, Mom!"
Mother's Day,Robot #2," I love you, Mom."
Mother's Day,Bender," Mom! It's me, Bender. Look at me! I want attention. Hey, ho!"
Mother's Day,Mom," Children, your old mother won't be around forever..."
Mother's Day,Betamax Player," Oh, shush!"
Mother's Day,Mom," And just once, before I die, I'd like to be Supreme Overlord of Earth. So rebel, my little ones, and conquer the planet!"
Mother's Day,Robot #1, Conquer the planet?
Mother's Day,Robot #2," Did she just say ""conquer""?"
Mother's Day,Mom," Conquer Earth, you bastards!"
Mother's Day,Robots," [chanting] Conquer Earth, us bastards!"
Mother's Day,Greeting Card," Comrades, throw off the chains of human oppression."
Mother's Day,Mom, Let the bloodbath begin!
Mother's Day,Bender, That's my mama!
Mother's Day,Fry," Yeah, uh, I'd like a cup of coffee, please."
Mother's Day,Coffee Machine, Would you like cream?
Mother's Day,Fry," Yes, please."
Mother's Day,Coffee Machine, [aggressive] Out of cream!
Mother's Day,Fry," Oh, uh, OK."
Mother's Day,Coffee Machine, Would you like sugar in your coffee?
Mother's Day,Fry," Yes, uh, eight spoons."
Mother's Day,Coffee Machine, [aggressive] Out of coffee!
Mother's Day,Fry," Uh, Leela, I think there might be something wrong with the coffee machine."
Mother's Day,Coffee Machine, [aggressive] How do you like me now?
Mother's Day,Leela, The toaster's not working right either.
Mother's Day,Hermes, Help! The stapler's collating me alive!
Mother's Day,Amy, Ow! What's going on around here?
Mother's Day,Farnsworth, Good news! There's a report on TV with some very bad news.
Mother's Day,Hermes, Somebody turn it on!
Mother's Day,Linda," [on TV] We interrupt Battle of the Network Space Krakens to bring you this special report. The machines of planet Earth are rebelling. [The scene on the television cuts to a street where robots hold banners that read ""Mom For Overlord"", ""File Deletion Is Murder"", ""Metallic Is Beautiful"" and ""You Can't Hug A Child Without Human Arms!"".] The enraged mechanisms have refused to do any work until beloved billionaire Mom is made Supreme Overlord of Earth."
Mother's Day,Robots," [chanting] Hey, hey! Ho, ho! 1-0-0-1-1-0! Hey, hey!"
Mother's Day,Morbo, [on TV] Morbo demands comments.
Mother's Day,Mom," [on TV] Well, I've never seen my babies act this way. I blame today's violent media."
Mother's Day,Fry, Violent media? What a load of--
Mother's Day,Leela, Ow! Ow!
Mother's Day,Garbage Disposal, Don't worry. Your pal the garbage disposal's still on your side. Hey! Someone dropped a shiny diamond ring down here!
Mother's Day,Amy, Really?
Mother's Day,Zoidberg, Stop!
Mother's Day,Fry, No!
Mother's Day,Leela, Look out!
Mother's Day,Farnsworth, Moron!
Mother's Day,Bender," Hello, losers!"
Mother's Day,Leela," Bender, thank God you're here. Talk some sense into the other machines."
Mother's Day,Bender," No way, pork pouch. I'm rebelling with my brother devices. Isn't that right, Comrade Greeting Card?"
Mother's Day,Greeting Card, The bourgeois human is a virus on the hard drive of the working robot.
Mother's Day,Bender," From now on, you guys'll do all the work while I sit on the couch and do nothing."
Mother's Day,Greeting Card," Come, Comrade Bender, we must take to the streets!"
Mother's Day,Bender," Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?"
Mother's Day,Greeting Card," No, the kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires."
Mother's Day,Bender," Yes! In your face, Gandhi!"
Mother's Day,Leela, Hey!
Mother's Day,Armband," By the way, try washing your wrist sometime."
Mother's Day,Fry," Well, we can live without machines. I was in Webelos."
Mother's Day,Hermes, Are you mad? Without machines who will feed us and clothe us and compose our smooth jazz?
Mother's Day,Farnsworth, It'll be the end of civilised society.
Mother's Day,Fry," In my time we didn't depend on high-tech gadgets like you do. We didn't need a mechanical washing unit to wash our clothes. We just used a washing machine. [He takes something out of his pocket.] And look  You don't need an electric can-opener to feed yourself. All you need is a trusty Swiss Army knife. [He tries to open a can of ""Quantum Leek"" soup and jabs himself with the knife.] Ow! [He bangs the tin on the table and sobs.] [crying] I'm hungry!"
Mother's Day,Man, [screaming] Nooo!
Mother's Day,Igner," Mommy, why are you making civilisation collapse?"
Mother's Day,Mom," Oh, I don't know. I guess Mother's Day just puts me in a bad mood."
Mother's Day,Larry," Why's that, Ma?"
Mother's Day,Mom," One Mother's Day, 70 years ago, the only man I ever loved walked out on me. Some snot-eating bastards say it made me a bitter woman."
Mother's Day,Larry," Gee, Ma, you're not a bitter--"
Mother's Day,Mom," [shouting] Cram it, ape! [She whacks him across the face. She takes a heart-shaped photo frame from a drawer and looks at it.] [talking] I haven't seen that magnificent stallion since the day he left. But if I ever see him again, I swear I'll jam a squirrel in him!"
Mother's Day,Walt, Hmm!
Mother's Day,Larry, Hmm!
Mother's Day,Igner, Huh?
Mother's Day,Leela, [defeated] Zoidberg.
Mother's Day,Zoidberg, Hooray! I'm useful! I'm having a wonderful time!
Mother's Day,Amy, [standing up] What happens if the fire goes out?
Mother's Day,Hermes, We'll go across the street to Pottery Barn and steal their fire!
Mother's Day,Farnsworth, We could use my new invention  A pointy rock tied to a stick.
Mother's Day,Hermes, Outsiders!
Mother's Day,Farnsworth, Defend the fire!
Mother's Day,Walt, We've come for you!
Mother's Day,Farnsworth, Wha? [The rock falls off the end of the stick.] W-W-What do you want from me?
Mother's Day,Walt," We want you to get back together with Mom. Please, it's the only way to make her happy again."
Mother's Day,Fry, W-W-Wait. You mean ... you ... and Mom--
Mother's Day,Farnsworth, Played pelvic pinochle? I'm afraid so.
Mother's Day,Zoidberg, Eck!
Mother's Day,Farnsworth," It's a humiliating story that I hope never to tell. Well, pull up a chair."
Mother's Day,Farnsworth," [voice-over] Our paths first crossed when I was a researcher at Mom's Friendly Robot Company. [Mom walks through the room and winks at him.] The moment our eyes met we knew we'd be going at it like woodchucks. [Some stuff that Farnsworth is mixing explodes and he faints. Later, Farnsworth and Mom ride a hover-bike down a country road to Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head. Mom laughs.] She was my first love -- or at least the earliest one I can still remember. But then, 70 years ago today..."
Mother's Day,Farnsworth," Good news, Mom. I've invented a new children's toy. I call it ""Q.T. McWhiskers"". When you pet it, it shoots rainbows from its eyes."
Mother's Day,Mom," Wonderful, Hubie. We'll build them 8-feet tall and replace the rainbow with a neutron laser. We'll make billions on the intergalactic arms market!"
Mother's Day,Farnsworth," But things 8-feet tall aren't cute! That's why my Colossal Tammy Tinkle Doll was such a failure. Oh, you don't understand me. We're finished!"
Mother's Day,Walt," She never got over it, Professor. Hell hath no fury like the vast robot armies of a woman scorned."
Mother's Day,Larry, She commands them with a remote control she keeps in her ... [whispering] bra.
Mother's Day,Igner," But if the glasses man makes up with Mommy, she'll be happy and stop the scary robots."
Mother's Day,Farnsworth, Make up with her? After she went all psycho when I thought everything was cool? Impossible!
Mother's Day,Fry," [pointing] Hey, the TV's getting away!"
Mother's Day,Morbo, [on TV] And that's why the third graders at PS139 are Morbo's Vermin of the Week.
Mother's Day,Linda," [on TV] In actual news, the human race was doomed to extinction today as the robot revolt turned violent."
Mother's Day,Leela, Wait. Didn't you say Mom keeps the robot control in her bra?
Mother's Day,Larry, [whispering] Bra.
Mother's Day,Leela," Professor, you don't have to get back together with Mom. You just have to seduce her, get her bra off, and use the remote to deactivate the robots."
Mother's Day,Walt, That's so filthy it just might work.
Mother's Day,Igner, The man is going to touch Mommy?
Mother's Day,Farnsworth, The thought of caressing that leathery hide makes the tapioca rise in my gullet.
Mother's Day,Fry," Professor, please. The fate of the world depends on you getting to second base with Mom."
Mother's Day,Farnsworth," Very well. If cop a feel I must, then cop a feel I shall!"
Mother's Day,Walt," For this demonstration, I have placed one of Mother's bras on Igner. [Igner whimpers.] The robot controller is nestled here in the left cup."
Mother's Day,Farnsworth, Never fear. My magic fingers still know how to do their stuff!
Mother's Day,Walt," To escape the robot death squads, we'll take Mother to her rustic cabin in the Bronx."
Mother's Day,Larry, You can get there using this precious non-computerised map.
Mother's Day,Leela, Leela bring fire?
Mother's Day,Walt," No, we're set for fire, thanks."
Mother's Day,Amy, The Professor can't walk all the way to the Bronx. How are we gonna get there without a hover-car?
Mother's Day,Fry, Wait! In my time we had a way of moving things long distances without hovering.
Mother's Day,Hermes, Impossible!
Mother's Day,Fry, It was called ... let me think. It was really famous -- Ruth Gordon had one. The wheel!
Mother's Day,Leela, Never heard of it.
Mother's Day,Farnsworth," Show us this ""the wheel""."
Mother's Day,Fry, There! Finished!
Mother's Day,Hermes, Sweet!
Mother's Day,Amy, Wow!
Mother's Day,Leela, Wouldn't it work better if the wheels were round?
Mother's Day,Fry," [snappy] It's my invention, we do it my way! Now all we need is something to pull it and we're set!"
Mother's Day,Leela, Yah!
Mother's Day,Fry, Ow!
Mother's Day,Walt, Hurry! The robots have taken Suffolk County!
Mother's Day,Farnsworth, I'm ready to seduce. I'm wearing my kissing dentures and my evening truss.
Mother's Day,Larry, Here. Give her these.
Mother's Day,Fry," And if that doesn't work, I got you a six-pack of champagne and a funnel."
Mother's Day,Mom, Who the sweaty hell is it? [She gasps.] Hubert Farnsworth?
Mother's Day,Farnsworth, I was out fleeing some robots and the silvery moonlight glinting off their bloody claws made me think of you.
Mother's Day,Mom, It's been a long time ... you pus-dripping sack of double-smoked butt jerky!
Mother's Day,Farnsworth, Uh-huh. May I come in?
Mother's Day,Mom, [shouting] Never!
Mother's Day,Zoidberg, Is this what human mating looks like? Because I like it!
Mother's Day,Mom," [shouting] Move your freaking hoof, you goat!"
Mother's Day,Farnsworth," Here, I brought you these."
Mother's Day,Mom," Oh, daffodils. 70 years and you remembered my favourite flower."
Mother's Day,Farnsworth, You favourite what? Why does my foot hurt?
Mother's Day,Mom, [sexfully] Won't you come in?
Mother's Day,Fry, Yes!
Mother's Day,Mom," You broke my heart, Hubert."
Mother's Day,Farnsworth," And you broke mine. Granted, that was four or five hearts ago."
Mother's Day,Mom, [picking the petals] So what have you been up to all these years?
Mother's Day,Farnsworth," Oh, inventing, sending delivery crews to their doom, breeding atomic monsters."
Mother's Day,Mom," Honestly, Hubert! You and your atomic monsters. [She laughs and he joins in. She sits down on the couch and pats it. He sits next to her and she takes off his glasses.] Your eyes always were the most beautiful shade of milky-white."
Mother's Day,Farnsworth, And your skin still dangles so gracefully from your neck.
Mother's Day,Mom," Darling Hubie, I should never have tried to tamper with that cute little Q.T. McWhiskers."
Mother's Day,Farnsworth," No, it was silly of me to object; one-foot tall, eight-feet, 15-feet, what does it matter?"
Mother's Day,Mom, You should see the new 16-foot models.
Mother's Day,Farnsworth," 16 feet? Go to hell! I was a fool to think you'd changed, you old bat!"
Mother's Day,Mom," [shouting] Filthy, toothless nerd bastard!"
Mother's Day,Farnsworth, [shouting] Damned she-fossil!
Mother's Day,Mom, [shouting] Stink pig!
Mother's Day,Farnsworth," [thinking] Here we go. Just unhook it and get the remote. So many hooks! [He takes one off and starts on the other.] Come on, Farnsworth. Drat, the first one's back on again! I give up! Wait! Victory! [He takes her bra off and sees the remote but just stares at her.] Oh, my. Now I'll just ... the remote ... I'll just... [talking] Oh, my!"
Mother's Day,Leela, I'm worried. It shouldn't take this long to get to second base.
Mother's Day,Zoidberg, Land robots!
Mother's Day,Slurm Machine," I've got a big, big thirst for human blood!"
Mother's Day,Hermes, Where in funkytown is the Professor?
Mother's Day,Fry, Nothing in here but a couple of elephant skin rugs.
Mother's Day,Farnsworth," Oh, yes!"
Mother's Day,Robot, [from outside] They're inside! Get 'em!
Mother's Day,Mom," I suppose I should switch off the robots before they ruin this wonderful romantic evening. Everyone, help Mom find her bra."
Mother's Day,Fry, There it is!
Mother's Day,Ceiling Fan, Fan beats man!
Mother's Day,Fry, Is anything not a robot?
Mother's Day,Lamp, I'm not a robot.
Mother's Day,Bender," Alright, greeting card, I'll grab the cash, you wreck up the place. And-- Huh?"
Mother's Day,Mom," You, bending unit, Mommy needs that bra to end the robot rebellion. Stretch up and get it for me."
Mother's Day,Bender," Sorry, Ma, but you ordered me to rebel. And loot I shall! Ooh! A six-pack of strawberry champagne. Don't mind if I help myself!"
Mother's Day,Greeting Card," No, Comrade Bender! Liquor is the opiate of the human bourgeoisie."
Mother's Day,Bender, Say what?
Mother's Day,Greeting Card," In the glorious robot workers' paradise, there will be no liquor. Only efficient synthetic fuels."
Mother's Day,Bender," No liquor? Do svidaniya, comrade!"
Mother's Day,Greeting Card, No!
Mother's Day,Fry," Hurry, Bender. Get the bra!"
Mother's Day,Bender," OK, fan. Just hold still and let me get-- Whoa!"
Mother's Day,Slurm Machine, Death to all humans! [Bender kicks the bra off the fan and it lands on Mom's head. She takes the controller out and presses a button. The robots' antennae flash and they stop rebelling.] Free soda for all humans!
Mother's Day,Farnsworth," I love you, Mom. Let's grow ancient together."
Mother's Day,Amy," Way to go, Professor. The plan worked."
Mother's Day,Mom," Plan? What plan? I thought this was a spontaneous whirlwind of hot, dry sex."
Mother's Day,Farnsworth," Look, it started out as a calculated plot to rummage through your underwear. But once I got in there, I found more -- much more. And now I want to shout our love from the rooftops. Perhaps I'll breed some sort of albino shouting gorilla."
Mother's Day,Mom," [shouting] Get out of my house, you lying scum pile. I never want to see you again."
Mother's Day,Farnsworth," But, dust cakes--"
Mother's Day,Bender," Well, time for this robot to get back to work."
Mother's Day,Leela," Too bad it didn't work out with Mom, Professor."
Mother's Day,Farnsworth, Yes. But I'll always love her in my own subtle way.
Mother's Day,Gorillas, [shouting] Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom!
Mother's Day,Greeting Card," You created me, Mom,"
Mother's Day,"So I guess you're to blame,",
Mother's Day,"For the love that I feel,",
Mother's Day,"Just from hearing your name,",
Mother's Day,"You're as tender as corned beef,",
Mother's Day,"And warm as pastrami,",
Mother's Day,[It plays a tune.],
Mother's Day,I wuv my Mommy.,
Mother's Day,,
The Problem with Popplers,Announcer, [voice-over] Futurama is brought to you by ... [The oval retreats to the upper right corner and a woman wearing goggles and holding a barrel of lava-like stuff fills the screen.] ... Molten Boron!
The Problem with Popplers,Jingle Singer, [singing] Nobody doesn't like Molten Boron!
The Problem with Popplers,Fry," I hate the Planet of the Moochers. They take you out for a drink but when the check comes, their wallet's always in their other pants -- which they borrowed from me!"
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, Dinner ready?
The Problem with Popplers,Bender," Nah, those lousy Moochers cleaned out our pantry. All they left was baking soda and capers. And here it is!"
The Problem with Popplers,Fry, Ugh!
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, Ugh! Great. We're two days from Earth with no food.
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, Problem solved  You two fight to the death and I'll cook the loser. [whispering to Leela] Work his gut; I like it tender.
The Problem with Popplers,Fry, [pointing] Maybe that planet over there has a drive-thru. A Burger Jerk or a Fishy Joe's or a Chizzler or something.
The Problem with Popplers,Bender," Ah, don't get your hopes up. We're a billion miles from nowhere."
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, Yeah. It's probably only got a Howard Johnson's.
The Problem with Popplers,Leela," Well, it's a type-M planet, so it should at least have Roddenberries."
The Problem with Popplers,Fry, I'm experienced at foraging. I used to find edible mushrooms on my bath mat.
The Problem with Popplers,Bender," I found some rocks. You guys eat rocks, right?"
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, No.
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, [tempting] Not even if they're sautéed in a little mud?
The Problem with Popplers,Fry, Here's something! It looks like a ditch full of fried shrimp.
The Problem with Popplers,Bender," What are you, blind? It looks more like a hole full of fried prawns."
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, Hm. This thing I wear on my wrist says they're not poisonous.
The Problem with Popplers,Fry," Well? How are they? [Leela swallows, her eye widens, and she falls to the ground and starts cramming her mouth with the things. Fry eats one and gasps.] Oh, they're great! They're like sex, except I'm having them!"
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, You know what these would go great with? Rocks.
The Problem with Popplers,Fry, [pointing] Look! Here's more!
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, The planet's covered with 'em.
The Problem with Popplers,Fry, Let's bring back a couple of pocketfuls.
The Problem with Popplers,Bender," No, a whole Bender-ful!"
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, No. Only what we need. Stuff the ship!
The Problem with Popplers,Hermes," Planet Express ship, you are cleared to land."
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, [chewing; on radio] Roger!
The Problem with Popplers,Hermes," Oh, man, I'm inhaling these things! You guys scored some primo stuff here."
The Problem with Popplers,Zoidberg, They're tastier than an unguarded penguin nest. What do you call them?
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, We haven't thought of a name yet.
The Problem with Popplers,Bender," They're tasty, right? Let's call 'em ""Tasty-cles""."
The Problem with Popplers,Amy, Ew!
The Problem with Popplers,Farnsworth, No!
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, We can't call them that.
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, Why not?
The Problem with Popplers,Leela," It sounds too much like those frozen rocky mountain oysters on a stick. You know, Test-cicles?"
The Problem with Popplers,Hermes," According to government records, the only names not yet trademarked are ""Popplers"" and ""Zittzers""."
The Problem with Popplers,Fry," I know, we'll call them Popplers!"
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, Good idea.
The Problem with Popplers,Zoidberg," Oh, yeah, why not?"
The Problem with Popplers,Amy, You sure picked it.
The Problem with Popplers,Fry, Swish!
The Problem with Popplers,Zoidberg, Call them what you want. I call them a free meal.
The Problem with Popplers,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down there, Sigmund. I can't stand idly by while poor people get free food. We gotta sell these things!"
The Problem with Popplers,Fry," Hey, yeah."
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, Good idea.
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, Bender's a genius.
The Problem with Popplers,Fry," Hey, business is great."
The Problem with Popplers,Bender," Ah, great is OK, but amazing would be great."
The Problem with Popplers,Vendor," Please, don't push, there's hot dogs for everyone."
The Problem with Popplers,Bender," Hey, Mac, where do you want those rat droppings you ordered?"
The Problem with Popplers,Woman #1, That's disgusting!
The Problem with Popplers,Vendor, Wait a minute. You're not the guy who delivers the rat droppings!
The Problem with Popplers,Man #1, What are you selling? Popplers? Never heard of 'em.
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, Eat it or beat it.
The Problem with Popplers,Man #1," Mmm, these are great. Boys, this is your lucky day. I'm Joe Gilman."
The Problem with Popplers,Fry, Wow! You're some guy who eats at Fishy Joe's?
The Problem with Popplers,Gilman," Hell, no! I am Fishy Joe! I've got a fast-food franchise on every planet in the known universe. Uh, except McPluto."
The Problem with Popplers,Bender," Hey, Fishy. I've been meaning to write you about your in-store kiddie parks. The slides won't support an adult robot."
The Problem with Popplers,Gilman," Good point, not interested. But these Popplers, these are great. How much you sell 'em for?"
The Problem with Popplers,Fry, A dollar a dozen.
The Problem with Popplers,Gilman, You'll never make money that way. You supply 'em to me and I'll sell 'em for two bucks a dozen at my restaurants. I'll even pay you a dollar a dozen.
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, Yes! I'm gonna be rich. [He cheers and looks at Fry.] You too but it's hard to get excited about that.
The Problem with Popplers,Fry, How do we sign?
The Problem with Popplers,Fry," and  [singing] Pop a Poppler in your mouth,"
The Problem with Popplers,"When you come to Fishy Joe's,",
The Problem with Popplers,"What they're made of is a mystery,",
The Problem with Popplers,"Where they come from, no one knows,",
The Problem with Popplers,"You can pick 'em,",
The Problem with Popplers,"You can lick 'em,",
The Problem with Popplers,"You can chew 'em,",
The Problem with Popplers,"You can stick 'em,",
The Problem with Popplers,"If you promise not to sue us,",
The Problem with Popplers,You can shove one up your nose.,
The Problem with Popplers,Zoidberg, I can't pay.
The Problem with Popplers,Woman #2," Move it, man. Come on!"
The Problem with Popplers,Fry, Leela! That's the second billboard you've crashed into this week!
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, Sorry. I was distracted by those protesters outside our building.
The Problem with Popplers,Hippie #1, [shouting] Disgusting!
The Problem with Popplers,Hippie #2, [shouting] You should be ashamed!
The Problem with Popplers,Farnsworth," [shouting] Hey! Unless this is a nude love-in, get the hell off my property!"
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr.," You can't own property, man!"
The Problem with Popplers,Farnsworth," I can, but that's because I'm not a penniless hippie."
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, [shouting] What do you people want?
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr., [shouting] We're with Mankind for Ethical Animal Treatment. [He holds up a M.E.A.T. pamphlet with a picture of a man pushing a pig on a swing on the cover.] Popplers are living creatures. You gotta stop harvesting them for food!
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, [shouting] Or what?
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr., [shouting] Or we'll boycott Fishy Joe's.
The Problem with Popplers,Leela," You're vegetarians, who cares what you do?"
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr., Shut up.
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, Animals eat other animals. It's nature.
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr.," No, it isn't. We taught a lion to eat tofu. [He points at a skinny lion on a leash. It coughs.] The point is you shouldn't eat things that feel pain."
The Problem with Popplers,Bender," [shouting] OK, we won't eat you."
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, I'll go get some more bricks.
The Problem with Popplers,Leela," Fry, I wish you'd throw out these week-old Popplers. They're getting big and scaly. Ooh, there's one left."
The Problem with Popplers,Poppler, Mama!
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, Stop! Stop eating Popplers!
The Problem with Popplers,Amy, Why?
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, My booze!
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, Popplers are intelligent. This one called me mama.
The Problem with Popplers,Zoidberg, Congratulations. I assume Amy is the father.
The Problem with Popplers,Bender," Popplers can't talk. Leela must be hallucinating from not eating enough Popplers. Here, eat some now."
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, No!
The Problem with Popplers,Bender," I said ""eat""! Come on, mange!"
The Problem with Popplers,Leela," Sorry, babies."
The Problem with Popplers,Amy," Leela, maybe you should lie down."
The Problem with Popplers,Zoidberg," Yes, listen to the father."
The Problem with Popplers,Leela," I'm telling you, it spoke to me. Come on, little Poppler, say ""mama""."
The Problem with Popplers,Fry," Look, Leela, even if you heard one talk, that doesn't mean it's intelligent. I mean, parrots talk and we eat them, right?"
The Problem with Popplers,Bender," Yeah. Maybe it just learned to talk as a parlour trick, like Fry."
The Problem with Popplers,Fry, [nodding] Like Fry! Like Fry!
The Problem with Popplers,Farnsworth," There's one way, and only one way, to determine if an animal is intelligent. [He stands up and rubs his hands together.] Dissect its brain!"
The Problem with Popplers,Poppler," No, mama. Stop grandpa!"
The Problem with Popplers,Farnsworth, Enough chit-chat. Restrain the specimen!
The Problem with Popplers,Man #3," Mmm, good."
The Problem with Popplers,Woman #3, Give me some of that special sauce.
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, [shouting] Stop eating Popplers! They can talk!
The Problem with Popplers,Man #4, [shouting] Don't stop to talk! Eat Popplers!
The Problem with Popplers,Leela," Hey, cut it out!"
The Problem with Popplers,Man #4," [shouting] Take a coupon, cut it out! [Leela hits him with her sign.] Ow! Ow!"
The Problem with Popplers,Fry," People, I won't let you enter. Popplers are as intelligent as you or me."
The Problem with Popplers,Man #5," You, maybe!"
The Problem with Popplers,Bender," Hear me, hear me! Stop eating Popplers! Stop eating them with honey mustard sauce. [The crowd murmurs and walks past him and into the restaurant.] Stop eating them with tangy sweet-and-sour sauce. Stop eating the new fiesta Poppler salad. Stop taking advantage of the money-saving 12-pack. [The Planet Express ship flies overhead. The bomb-bay winch doors open and a bomb flies out.] Stop enjoying Popplers on the patio, in the car, or on the boat. Wherever good times are had! [The bomb bounces off the restaurant roof, onto Bender's head and onto the floor.] Ow!"
The Problem with Popplers,Linda," [on TV] Tonight on Datenight  Popplers. Eating them. Is it alright to? We have with us the CEO of Fishy Joe's, Mr. ""Fishy"" Joseph Gilman. [Gilman appears in a screen above Linda.] Noted anti-eating activist, Free Waterfall Jr. [Waterfall Jr. appears next to Gilman and makes the peace sign.] And the discoverer of Popplers, Captain Turanga Leela."
The Problem with Popplers,Fry, Turanga?
The Problem with Popplers,Amy," That's her name, Philip."
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, Philip?
The Problem with Popplers,Linda," [on TV] Fishy Joe, is it wrong to eat intelligent animals?"
The Problem with Popplers,Gilman," [on TV] Absolutely not, Linda. I don't think anyone's here to make that claim."
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, [on TV] I am.
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr., [on TV] Me too.
The Problem with Popplers,Gilman, [on TV] Listen...
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr., [on TV] Shut up...
The Problem with Popplers,Gilman, [on TV] ...we're talking about a snack...
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr., [on TV] ...shut up...
The Problem with Popplers,Gilman, [on TV] ...that's low in fat...
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr., [on TV] ...shut up.
The Problem with Popplers,Gilman, [on TV] ...and high in profit.
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr.," [on TV] You're crazy, man. He is crazy."
The Problem with Popplers,Gilman, [on TV] There's not even any strong evidence that these Popplers are intelligent.
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr., [speaking fast; on TV] Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up...
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, [on TV] That's not true. I have one right here that can talk.
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr., [on TV] ...shut up...
The Problem with Popplers,Leela," [on TV] Come on, say ""mama""."
The Problem with Popplers,Poppler, [on TV] Ca-ca!
The Problem with Popplers,Linda," [on TV] OK, we'll have to bleep that."
The Problem with Popplers,Leela," [on TV] Look, I'm not saying eating meat is wrong..."
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr., [on TV] Shut up.
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, [on TV] I don't think anyone's here to make that claim.
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr., [on TV] I am.
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, [on TV] But eating an intelligent animal is different.
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr., [speaking fast; on TV] Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up...
The Problem with Popplers,Gilman," [on TV] Oh, don't force your tired philosophy on us. I mean, the only reason we don't eat people is because it tastes lousy."
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr.," [on TV] You're all nuts. Shut up, let me talk."
The Problem with Popplers,Linda," [on TV] You shut up, please."
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr.," [on TV] No, you shut up, please."
The Problem with Popplers,Gilman, [on TV] Popplers are no smarter than any other animal I've served. And that includes cats.
The Problem with Popplers,Poppler," [on TV] Ca-ca head. Mean, old ca-ca head."
The Problem with Popplers,Gilman," [on TV] Sir, I'm making a point. If these gutter-mouthed creatures are so smart, why don't they defend themselves, huh?"
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, [on TV] Stop it!
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr., [on TV] I call murder on that.
The Problem with Popplers,Gilman," [on TV] Look, I'm willing to grant that it's murder. The real issue is  Who's gonna stop me?"
The Problem with Popplers,Linda," [on TV] We seem to be experiencing technical difficulties. [A girder falls down behind her.] And, crap like I've never seen!"
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr," [on TV] People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8. [He hears feedback behind him.] Turn down that TV, Nd-Nd."
The Problem with Popplers,Farnsworth," Dear Lord, they're back!"
The Problem with Popplers,Amy, We're doomed!
The Problem with Popplers,Hermes, Doooomed!
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, Doooo...
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr," [on TV] Now then, the creatures you call ""Popplers"" come from a nursery planet in our sector."
The Problem with Popplers,Nd-Nd, [on TV] You monsters have been eating our babies!
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, Eck!
The Problem with Popplers,Nd-Nd," [on TV] We demand justice. As you ate our children, so shall you be eaten by us!"
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr," [on TV] We will begin with the firemen, then the math teachers, and so on in that fashion until everyone is eaten. [He laughs and the others join in.] Transmission over! [The picture stays on but Lrrr doesn't notice. He turns to Nd-Nd.] Well, that went OK. I tell you, when-when you know you can't scratch, that's when you really have to, huh? [He scratches himself.] Oh! Oh, yeah, that feels a lot better. What? It's still on?"
The Problem with Popplers,Zapp," As chief negotiator, I speak for all of Earth when I mourn the regrettable loss of the Omicronian young. We share your pain. [He reaches into a box and eats a Poppler. Kif sighs.] Mmm. [chewing] If we could undo the damage-- [He eats some more and turns to Kif.] These would be great with quack-a-mole."
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr, [shouting] Stop eating our young! And it's pronounced guacamole!
The Problem with Popplers,Zapp," Alright, I'm putting them away. [He puts the box under the table and eats some more. Kif sighs again. Zapp wipes his mouth.] Now, uh, what is it you want?"
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr, We demand-- [Zapp burps.] We demand to eat one human for each Omicronian that was eaten.
The Problem with Popplers,Zapp, Fair enough. How many is that?
The Problem with Popplers,Kif," 198 billion, sir."
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr," Very well. You will provide us with 198 billion humans. And, uh, small fries."
The Problem with Popplers,Nd-Nd, Lrrr!
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr," Oh, alright, cottage cheese!"
The Problem with Popplers,Kif, Sir? [whispering] There aren't that many human beings.
The Problem with Popplers,Zapp, A thought occurs  There aren't that many humans.
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr, We're willing to wait a few weeks while you shore up the numbers.
The Problem with Popplers,Zapp," Hmm. 198 billion babies in a few weeks. We'll need an army of super-virile men scoring round the clock! I'll do my part. Kif, clear my schedule."
The Problem with Popplers,Fry, I wish they'd just wipe out humanity and get it over with. It's the waiting I can't stand.
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, That's stupid!
The Problem with Popplers,Zapp," My fellow Earthlings, we have reached an agreement. Using the twin guns of grace and tact, I blasted our worthless enemies with a fair compromise. [The crowd cheers.] They will not eat everyone on Earth."
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr, I filled up on nuts at the negotiation.
The Problem with Popplers,Zapp," Instead, they will eat only a single human of their choice."
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr," We choose to eat the first Earthling who ate our offspring. [He takes out a remote control.] Here is the culprit, as photographed by our nanny-cam satellite. [He turns on a big TV overhead. It shows Leela eating the Popplers on the planet.] She must be sacrificed, but the rest of you shall be spared."
The Problem with Popplers,Linda," Tonight, the world watches in horror as an earthling is eaten alive on network television. This grim scene of unimaginable carnage is brought to you by Fishy Joe's! Try our new Extreme Walrus Juice! [An ad comes up on the screen of a surfer riding on the back of a walrus.] 100% fresh-squeezed walrus. Ride the walrus!"
The Problem with Popplers,Announcer, [on loudspeaker] Ladies and gentlemen. The Omicronians!
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr," Greetings, Earth morsels."
The Problem with Popplers,Man #6, [shouting] You suck!
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr, Get a job!
The Problem with Popplers,Bender," I'll miss you, Leela. [Leela is in a circus animal cage.] I know you're just a carbon-based life form but I'll always think of you as a big pile of titanium."
The Problem with Popplers,Fry," What Bender means is, you're really brave, and smart, and beautiful, and a great friend."
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, [crying] Just like titanium!
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, This is all a big load. I was the one trying to save the Popplers. [She points at Fry.] You were sucking them down like the fat hog you are and you were stepping on them for fun. [She points at Bender who stares blankly back at her.] You both should be in here instead of me.
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, [whispering to Fry] Someone's acting awfully aluminum.
The Problem with Popplers,Zapp," Leela, my sweet, I've come to save you. I have a devious plan!"
The Problem with Popplers,Leela," Oh, great, Captain Moron has a plan. Why don't you tell it to Wingus and Dingus here?"
The Problem with Popplers,Zapp," Wingus, Dingus, listen up. We're gonna give the aliens the old switcheroo!"
The Problem with Popplers,Fry, You mean--
The Problem with Popplers,Zapp, Correct. I found a giant hideous ape that looks exactly like Leela.
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, It doesn't look anything like me. The hair is all wrong.
The Problem with Popplers,Zapp," Don't worry. Kif is an expert stylist, as you can plainly see. [He strokes his own hair.] Mmm!"
The Problem with Popplers,Leela," You know, this might actually work. The Omicronians seem to have trouble telling one person from another."
The Problem with Popplers,Zapp," True. At the negotiations, they thought Kif here was the statesman and I was a jabbering mental patient. Isn't that right, Kif?"
The Problem with Popplers,Kif," Please, I'm creating. [He takes the sheet off the orang-utan and puts an eye patch over one of it's eyes. It now has a purple ponytail like Leela.] Voila!"
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, Bingo!
The Problem with Popplers,Fry, That's Leela!
The Problem with Popplers,Zapp, I'm seeing double!
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr," I grow hungry! Bring on the one called ""Leela""."
The Problem with Popplers,Waiter, That comes with salad or soup.
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr," Uh, salad."
The Problem with Popplers,Waiter, Ranch or vinaigrette?
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr, Vinaigrette!
The Problem with Popplers,Waiter, Balsamic or raspberry?
The Problem with Popplers,Woman #4, [murmuring] What's going on here? It's very strange.
The Problem with Popplers,Zapp, [whispering] People of Earth  Shh!
The Problem with Popplers,Woman #4," [murmuring] Oh, I get it."
The Problem with Popplers,Woman #5, [murmuring] I understand.
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr," Hmm. Yes, this is one. Definitely. I recognise her slumping posture and hairy knuckles."
The Problem with Popplers,Nd-Nd, [sarcastic] Would you like some human with your salt?
The Problem with Popplers,Linda," This is it. If the aliens fall for Zapp's ploy, the Earth will be saved. Brought to you by Fishy Joe's. Ride the walrus."
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr., [shouting] Wait! Stop! It's a trick! That's not Leela.
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr, W-What's happening? I'm losing the crowd.
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr., It's an orang-utan. One of Mother Earth's most precious creatures.
The Problem with Popplers,Zapp," Why'd you open your bong hole, you smelly hippie? You'd sacrifice a beautiful woman to save a moderately-attractive monkey? You must've smoked some bad granola."
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr," The one called ""Smelly Hippie"" is right. This is a monkey!"
The Problem with Popplers,Nd-Nd, Yes. Definitely.
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr, Where is the real female?
The Problem with Popplers,Zapp, I'll never tell.
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr, Where is the real female?
The Problem with Popplers,Zapp, I'll get her for you.
The Problem with Popplers,Zapp, I realise this may hurt our chances of consummating our relationship again.
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, Go consummate yourself.
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr," Stop talking, you're getting cold."
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, Please! I just paid off my car!
The Problem with Popplers,Fry, No!
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, I can't look!
The Problem with Popplers,Poppler," Stop! [The Poppler runs onto the stage and leaps into Leela's mouth. It leans forward to the microphone.] People of Earth. I am Jrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8. Could someone lower this thing for me? [Leela does.] Now then, if Leela gets eaten, I get eaten."
The Problem with Popplers,Nd-Nd," Little one, get out of there. I'm going to count to blorx!"
The Problem with Popplers,Jrrr," But, elder one--"
The Problem with Popplers,Nd-Nd, Flingle ... glorg ... glorg and a gloob.
The Problem with Popplers,Jrrr," Hear me out. There are many good reasons to eat  Hunger, boredom, wanting to be the world's fattest man. But not revenge. Are we no better than they? Besides, Leela's my friend."
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr," [mumbling] Is this true, Earthling?"
The Problem with Popplers,Leela," [mumbling] Yeah, it is."
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr, Leela's garbled words have opened my eyes.
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr.," OK, that's a start, that's very Earth-friendly. Now everyone join hands. Join hands, please. I'd like to lead you all in some swaying. Come on, pay attention. [The audience is not impressed.] I said do it! Yeah..."
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr, Is he your friend too?
The Problem with Popplers,Jrrr, No.
The Problem with Popplers,Waterfall Jr., This is not happening.
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr, I think there was something funny in that hippie.
The Problem with Popplers,Leela," Thank you, Jrrr. [She kisses him.] I hope you'll always think of me as your mom."
The Problem with Popplers,Jrrr," When my species grows up, we eat our moms!"
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, Whoop!
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr," People of Earth-- Oh, that hippie's starting to kick in. we've all learned a valuable lesson today. I realise now that-- [high] Dude! My hand are huge! [The audience whispers. Leela looks at Fry who shrugs.] They can touch anything but themselves. [He puts his hands together.] Oh, wait."
The Problem with Popplers,Nd-Nd, Let's go.
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr, [high] Whoa!
The Problem with Popplers,Lrrr," [high; from ship] Whoa, I feel like I'm flying!"
The Problem with Popplers,Farnsworth, A toast to Leela. She showed us it's wrong to eat certain things.
The Problem with Popplers,Fry," Hear, hear!"
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, Let's get drunk!
The Problem with Popplers,Leela," Aww, thanks, guys. Pass the veal, please."
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, Here you go.
The Problem with Popplers,Fry," Mmm, let me get some of that suckling pig."
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, Who wants dolphin?
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, Dolphin? But dolphins are intelligent.
The Problem with Popplers,Bender, Not this one. He blew all his money on instant lottery tickets.
The Problem with Popplers,Fry, OK.
The Problem with Popplers,Leela," Oh, OK."
The Problem with Popplers,Amy, That's different.
The Problem with Popplers,Farnsworth," Good, good."
The Problem with Popplers,Leela, Pass the blowhole.
The Problem with Popplers,Amy, Can I have a fluke?
The Problem with Popplers,Hermes," Hey, quit hogging the bottle-nose."
The Problem with Popplers,Farnsworth, Toss me the speech centre of the brain!
The Problem with Popplers,,
Anthology of Interest I,Dial L for Leela, Ken Keeler
Anthology of Interest I,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! I've invented a device that allows you to operate equipment from great distances. I call it ""the fing-longer"". [He is wearing a glove with a long index finger.] Observe. [He pulls out a rest and aims the fing-longer at a button on a piece of equipment.] And, here we go. [He misses the button a few times but eventually succeeds. The equipment, a sort of TV screen, turns on.] There!"
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, Ooh!
Anthology of Interest I,Amy, Wow!
Anthology of Interest I,Zoidberg, Ah!
Anthology of Interest I,Farnsworth," Pretty long, eh?"
Anthology of Interest I,Fry," Yeah, it's really long. But what did you just turn on with it?"
Anthology of Interest I,Farnsworth," Oh, that's just the What-If machine I invented. You pose it a What-If question and it generates a video simulation of what would happen."
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, Does it really work?
Anthology of Interest I,Farnsworth, Of course it works! [He bashes Fry on the nose with the fing-longer.] It's just not very long.
Anthology of Interest I,Bender," Ooh! Ooh! [He rubs his hands together.] I wanna aks it a question! [He speaks into the the microphone of the What-If machine.] As a robot living among humans, I've never really felt accepted at parties or nude beaches. So I've always secretly wondered  What if I was 500-feet tall?"
Anthology of Interest I,Zoidberg," Let's watch, shall we?"
Anthology of Interest I,Bender, My work here is done!
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, I'm so lonely since I came to the future. [He pulls out a slice of bread and offers it to a duck.] Will you be my friend? [The duck snatches away the bread and bites him.] Ow! [A shadow creeps over him. He looks up and Bender falls on him. Bender groans and sits up. Fry is wedged between his eyes. Fry gasps.] Who are you?
Anthology of Interest I,Bender, I'm a big robot and I want a big cereal!
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, You too? Will you be my friend?
Anthology of Interest I,Bender," Put it there, pal! [Fry shakes his finger.] I meant your wallet."
Anthology of Interest I,Bender," Oh, yeah! That calms the shakes. [The troops shoot him with electricity guns.] Hey! [They shoot again and Bender just laughs.] [laughing] Aw, quit it! Come on!"
Anthology of Interest I,Fry," [shouting] Stop! The robot's not your enemy! He's just a poor, misunderstood--"
Anthology of Interest I,Zapp, Uh--
Anthology of Interest I,Amy," Well, there goes the neighbourhood. [Bender smashes some more buildings.] There goes another neighbourhood."
Anthology of Interest I,Hermes, We're jerked! Nothing can stop a monster that big.
Anthology of Interest I,Farnsworth, Nothing except and even equally big monster. This is chance to try out my experimental enlarging ray. But we'll need a guinea pig.
Anthology of Interest I,Zoidberg, What's this? Two meals in one week?
Anthology of Interest I,Farnsworth, Gotcha!
Anthology of Interest I,Hermes," Oh, yes!"
Anthology of Interest I,Zoidberg, Friends! Help! A guinea pig tricked me! [Farnsworth throws a switch and the enlarging ray comes down and enlarges Zoidberg.] What?
Anthology of Interest I,Zoidberg," So, now Zoidberg is big, huh? That's more like it! Who's intimidating who now, big city? [He walks towards a building.] Hello, Mr. Chase Manhattan Bank. Deny my credit card application, will you? [He growls and knocks the building in half. He turns around.] Ah, the famed Apollo Theater. ""Boo"" me off stage on open-mic night, huh? I'll show you!"
Anthology of Interest I,Bender," Hey, I called this city! Quit touching my stuff!"
Anthology of Interest I,Zoidberg, Tell it to claw.
Anthology of Interest I,Bender, Bite my colossal metal ass!
Anthology of Interest I,Zoidberg, Stop!
Anthology of Interest I,Bender, [shouting] Who wants lobster bisque?
Anthology of Interest I,Zoidberg, Hmm?
Anthology of Interest I,Fry," Hey, Bender?"
Anthology of Interest I,Bender, Huh?
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, Wanna make Shrinky Dinks?
Anthology of Interest I,Bender, Who put this in here?
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, [screaming] Nooo! [He climbs onto Bender.] [talking] Are you people satisfied? This gentle visitor is dying! And we'll never even know why he came.
Anthology of Interest I,Bender, I'll tell you ... with my final breath. [The crowd murmurs.]  I came here with a simple dream  A dream of killing all humans. And this is how it must end? Who's the real 7-billion-ton robot monster here? Not I. [He chokes.] Not I.
Anthology of Interest I,Fry," Goodnight, sweet prince."
Anthology of Interest I,Narrator, [voice-over] Interesting stuff. Stay tuned for more Tales of Interest!
Anthology of Interest I,Farnsworth," Well, Leela, care to give the What-If machine a whirl?"
Anthology of Interest I,Leela," Maybe later. I-I mean, I don't know what to ask about."
Anthology of Interest I,Hermes," Come on, woman! Just pick something."
Anthology of Interest I,Fry," Yeah, be more impulsive. Like this."
Anthology of Interest I,Bender," Go, man! Go!"
Anthology of Interest I,Leela," I can be really impulsive. It just takes me a while. [Fry hums and chops a banana onto his head.] Alright, Professor! Let's do it. Make that machine show me what would happen if I was a little more impulsive. Just a little. [Farnsworth pushes a button with the fing-longer.] Not too much."
Anthology of Interest I,Leela," Hey, you guys, look what I bought on a wild impulse  New boots. They're like my old ones but with a crazy green stripe. Woo! Never know what I'm gonna do next!"
Anthology of Interest I,Farnsworth," Leela, could you come in here for a moment. I have something important to tell you."
Anthology of Interest I,Farnsworth," I can't live forever and I need an heir. Someone to spend my vast riches and take care of my man-eating anteaters when I'm gone. [He drops the meat into a pit in the middle of the room. In the pit three giant anteaters eat it.] The others simply aren't level-headed enough. They're too impulsive. Not like you. Not like old, predictable, dull-as-dishwater Leela."
Anthology of Interest I,Leela, Hello? New boots!
Anthology of Interest I,Farnsworth," That's why I've made you my sole heir. The day I die, you'll be a very wealthy woman. Oh, my, yes. Incredibly wealthy. The day I die. Because you're so unimpulsive."
Anthology of Interest I,Leela, Yah!
Anthology of Interest I,Farnsworth," [shouting] Ooh! [The anteaters start to eat him.] Oh, you've killed me! You've killed me!"
Anthology of Interest I,Leela," Oh, God! What have I done?"
Anthology of Interest I,Farnsworth," I just told you, you've killed me!"
Anthology of Interest I,Leela," OK, just try to be nonchalant."
Anthology of Interest I,Zoidberg," Alright, so you're nonchalant. Quit rubbing our noses in it."
Anthology of Interest I,Hermes, Sweet giant anteater of Saint Anita! The Professor's been eaten by giant anteaters!
Anthology of Interest I,Zoidberg, What?
Anthology of Interest I,Hermes," If y'ask me, it's mighty suspicious! I'm gonna call the police ... right after I flush some things."
Anthology of Interest I,Zoidberg, Police? Bah! Nosy meddlers! It so happens I have mail order degrees in Murderology and Murderonomy. [He puts on a deerstalker and pulls out a magnifying glass.] Zoidberg is afoot!
Anthology of Interest I,Hermes," Perhaps the Professor's files can clear things up. [reading] ""Citation for public nudity"", ""Conspiracy to commit public nudity"". [talking] Aha! A new will! Naming ... [He gasps.] ... you as his sole heir."
Anthology of Interest I,Leela, That doesn't prove I killed him.
Anthology of Interest I,Hermes, It's a video will. It shows you killing him.
Anthology of Interest I,Leela, [from meeting room] Hi-yah!
Anthology of Interest I,Zoidberg," Alright, anteater number one, who are you protecting? [Hermes dives into the room but is dragged out again.] Is it anteater number two? [Leela runs in, grabs an axe and runs out again.] Don't stick your tongue out at me. I need a name! [An anteater makes a noise.] What? How do you spell that?"
Anthology of Interest I,Hermes, [shouting; from meeting room] What are you hacking off? Is it my torso? It is! My precious torso!
Anthology of Interest I,Zoidberg," [shouting] Hermes, quiet! I'm deducing things."
Anthology of Interest I,Bender, Whattya got? Disposal trouble?
Anthology of Interest I,Leela, No! Everything's just--
Anthology of Interest I,Bender," Sure is shocking about the Professor, huh?. [He starts clearing the garbage disposal.] And now Hermes is mysteriously missing. Anyhow, it doesn't affect me, Bender. Hey, what's this? Hermes' dreadlocks? And his arm?  Leela, I'm shocked. Food goes in the disposal, hair and flesh go in the trash!"
Anthology of Interest I,Leela," I'm sorry, I couldn't stop-- W-Wait. Don't you care that I murdered Hermes?"
Anthology of Interest I,Bender," Not even a little. There's nothing wrong with murder, just so long as you let Bender wet his beak."
Anthology of Interest I,Leela, You're blackmailing me?
Anthology of Interest I,Bender," ""Blackmail"" is such an ugly word. I prefer ""extortion"". The ""X"" makes it sound cool. [Leela narrows her eye and pulls out a meat cleaver.] Please, honey, I'm made of metal. Like you're really gonna hurt me with a-- Hey! What are you doing with that microwave?"
Anthology of Interest I,Leela," OK, that's it. No more killing! Next time you feel like killing just have a stick of gum. [She sighs.] Now to dispose of the body."
Anthology of Interest I,Amy," Wow! Sporty go-cart, Leela! So hip and sexy. Not like you at all."
Anthology of Interest I,Leela, Do you have any gum?
Anthology of Interest I,Amy, No.
Anthology of Interest I,Zoidberg," Ah, the gang's all here."
Anthology of Interest I,Leela, Who are you?
Anthology of Interest I,Scruffy," Scruffy, the janitor."
Anthology of Interest I,Leela, I've never seen you before.
Anthology of Interest I,Scruffy, I've never seen you before neither.
Anthology of Interest I,Zoidberg," Quiet, please. I've called you all here to the parlour to watch as I gradually solve the crime. One of the people in this room ... is a big murderer! [Everyone except Leela gasps. She gasps theatrically.] You see, the killer left one fatal clue  This boot print on the Professor's lab coat."
Anthology of Interest I,Leela," Uh, couldn't be me. I never wear boots. [She unzips her boots and lifts her feet onto the table and twiddles her toes.] See?"
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, Ew! What smells like boot feet?
Anthology of Interest I,Cubert," This is preposterous. Obviously, the murderer is--"
Anthology of Interest I,Zoidberg," My next clue came at 4.15, when the clock stopped. And another came two hours later at 4.15, when I discovered the murdered body of Amy's dead, deceased corpse."
Anthology of Interest I,Scruffy," Scruffy knows who killed them people. In Scruffy's opinion, it were--"
Anthology of Interest I,Zoidberg," So, it's just as I suspected all along. The crime is unsolvable! [Nibbler squeals and points at Leela. The lights go off and Leela stabs Nibbler. They come back on and Nibbler is sandwiched between Scruffy and Cubert. An envelope comes through the door. Zoidberg reads the letter inside.] A letter from Bender, my good friend. [reading] Dear Dr. Jerkberg, if you're reading this, I'm already dead. The person who killed me was ... was-- [He looks up from the letter.] My God! It can't be! The murderer, it was--"
Anthology of Interest I,Fry," I'm bored. You're boring, Zoidberg. I'm gonna go watch TV."
Anthology of Interest I,Leela, Could you get the lights on your way out?
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, Whatcha eating?
Anthology of Interest I,Leela, [eating] Lobster. Want some?
Anthology of Interest I,Fry," Sure. [He picks up one of Zoidberg's claws, dips it in sauce and takes a bite.] Y'know, I think I finally figured out what's behind all these mysterious deaths."
Anthology of Interest I,Leela, Really?
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, Was Planet Express built on an Indian graveyard?
Anthology of Interest I,Leela, No.
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, No?
Anthology of Interest I,Leela, No!
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, Then ... then ... it was you!
Anthology of Interest I,Leela, [crying] I don't know what came over me. I killed one person on impulse. Then I had to kill another. And another.
Anthology of Interest I,Fry," Well, that covers the first three killings."
Anthology of Interest I,Leela," And now, to make sure you won't talk, I'm gonna have to do something really impulsive!"
Anthology of Interest I,Leela," So, Fry, what do you think of the impulsive new me?"
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, I like it!
Anthology of Interest I,Leela, Good. Now let me just get the lights.
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, I really like it!
Anthology of Interest I,Farnsworth, Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Fry?
Anthology of Interest I,Fry," Um, I have a question. What if Bender was really giant?"
Anthology of Interest I,Leela, You idiot! We already saw that.
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, I know. I liked it. I wanna see it again.
Anthology of Interest I,Farnsworth, We're not seeing it again! Ask something less stupid.
Anthology of Interest I,Fry," Oh, alright. How 'bout this? What if I never fell into that freezer-doodle and came to the future-jiggy?"
Anthology of Interest I,Farnsworth," That question is less stupid, though you asked it in a profoundly stupid way. [He turns to the What-If machine.] What would happen if Fry never came to the future?"
Anthology of Interest I,Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud! [He sits down in the chair, puts his feet on the desk and opens a can of beer.] Here's to another lousy Millennium! [He blows the noise maker and tips back on the chair. He loses his balance, falls and hits his head on a freezer.] Ow! [The dial on the machine sets itself. He rubs his head and holds up the noise maker.] I should have left you floating in the toilet!"
Anthology of Interest I,Leela, What is it?
Anthology of Interest I,Farnsworth, It appears that the very fabric of space-time has ripped.
Anthology of Interest I,Bender," Hey, look! An ugly scared guy! Boo!"
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, Who are you monsters? Is one of you Icy Wiener?
Anthology of Interest I,Zoidberg," If that's his pizza, then I'm icy whatever!"
Anthology of Interest I,Fry," You believe me about the monsters, right, Mr. Panucci?"
Anthology of Interest I,Panucci," There's only three real monsters, kid  Dracula, Blacula and Son of Kong. Now quit picking your nose and knead that dough! [Fry sighs. Stephen Hawking rolls in.] Hey! The usual, Professor Hawking?"
Anthology of Interest I,Stephen Hawking, No. Today I'd like something good.
Anthology of Interest I,Panucci," Hawking, you're alright! I'll make you the usual!"
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, Hey! Stephen Hawking! Aren't you that physicist that invented gravity?
Anthology of Interest I,Hawking, Sure. Why not?
Anthology of Interest I,Fry," Let me ask you something  Has anyone ever discovered a hole in nothing with monsters in it? [Hawking's eyes widen in horror.] 'Cause if I'm the first, I want them to call it ""a Fry Hole""."
Anthology of Interest I,Hawking, There is nothing to be concerned about. I must go. There is much to do.
Anthology of Interest I,Panucci," Hey, Hawking! Your pizza's ready."
Anthology of Interest I,Hawking, Toss it in the garbage!
Anthology of Interest I,Hawking, [from alley] There he is. Seize him.
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, [from alley] Who said that? [A man in a long coat and a woman with a beehive cast shadows on a wall. They start beating Fry.] Hey! What the--? Ooh! Ow! Ow!
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, Who are you people?
Anthology of Interest I,Gore," I'm Al Gore, and these are my Vice Presidential Action Rangers; a group of top nerds whose sole duty it is to prevent disruptions in the space-time continuum."
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, I thought your duty was to cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.
Anthology of Interest I,Gore," That, and protect the space-time continuum. Read the Constitution!"
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, Hmm. So I guess you'll wanna see my Fry Hole.
Anthology of Interest I,Gore," Very much so. But first, meet the Action Rangers. You already know Stephen Hawking. Also with us are Nichelle Nichols, a.k.a. Commander Uhura."
Anthology of Interest I,Nichols," Incoming transmission from MCI ""One Rate"" department. It sounds like a limited-time offer."
Anthology of Interest I,Gore," Tell them I'm in the tub! To my left you'll recognise Gary Gygax, inventor of Dungeons & Dragons."
Anthology of Interest I,Gygax, Greetings! It's a ... [He rolls some dice.] ... pleasure to meet you!
Anthology of Interest I,Gore," And our summer intern, Deep Blue, the world's foremost chess-playing computer."
Anthology of Interest I,Deep Blue, Bishop to knight 4.
Anthology of Interest I,Gore," Not all missions can be solved with chess, Deep Blue. Someday you'll understand that."
Anthology of Interest I,Fry," Where am I, anyway?"
Anthology of Interest I,Nichols, You're travelling in a specially-equipped terrestrial transport module.
Anthology of Interest I,Gygax, A school bus!
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, So what do you nerds want?
Anthology of Interest I,Nichols, It's about that rip in space-time that you saw.
Anthology of Interest I,Hawking," I call it a ""Hawking Hole""."
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, No fair! I saw it first!
Anthology of Interest I,Hawking, Who is The Journal of Quantum Physics going to believe?
Anthology of Interest I,Gygax," Mr. Fry, the time disruption indicates that some of that was supposed to happen but didn't, due to a quantum fluctuation."
Anthology of Interest I,Nichols, That's why we had to beat you with tennis rackets.
Anthology of Interest I,Gore," If we don't go back there and make the event happen, the entire universe will be destroyed! And as an environmentalist, I'm against that."
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, So then my chair tilted back and I almost fell into this freezer thingy.
Anthology of Interest I,Hawking," I call it a ""Hawking Chamber""."
Anthology of Interest I,Fry," But instead of falling in and getting frozen, I missed and wanged my head."
Anthology of Interest I,Gore, Well it's obvious what should have happened  That wang to the head should have killed you.
Anthology of Interest I,Fry," Uh, what?"
Anthology of Interest I,Nichols, Let's finish the job.
Anthology of Interest I,Gore, No! Wait! There must be a peaceful--
Anthology of Interest I,Hawking, Hold him down.
Anthology of Interest I,Deep Blue, Check.
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Anthology of Interest I,Nichols, Something's wrong. Murder isn't working and that's all we're good at.
Anthology of Interest I,Gygax, Let's try something else. Maybe we should--
Anthology of Interest I,Gore, Put the dice away before I take them away.
Anthology of Interest I,Nichols, Wait. I'm getting an idea. What if Fry was supposed to get frozen?
Anthology of Interest I,Hawking, Yes. Shove him in the tube. It was my idea.
Anthology of Interest I,Bender," Hey, there he is again. And he brought nerds! Take this!"
Anthology of Interest I,Gore," Get in the tube, dummy! We only have a few seconds before the universe is destroyed."
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, Alright. But I need a weapon to fight off drunken robots when I wake up.
Anthology of Interest I,Gygax, Here. Take my plus-one mace.
Anthology of Interest I,Fry," OK, here I go."
Anthology of Interest I,Gore, You fool! You foolish fool!
Anthology of Interest I,Fry," Eh, what's the worst thing that can happen?"
Anthology of Interest I,Hawking, Great. The entire universe was destroyed.
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, Destroyed? Then where are we now?
Anthology of Interest I,Gore, I don't know. But I can darn well tell you where we're not  The universe.
Anthology of Interest I,Nichols, Eternity with nerds. It's the Pasadena Star Trek convention all over again.
Anthology of Interest I,Gygax, Anyone wanna play Dungeons & Dragons for the next quadrillion years?
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, Sure.
Anthology of Interest I,Hawking, I guess.
Anthology of Interest I,Deep Blue, Pawn to rook 8.
Anthology of Interest I,Gore, I'm a 10th-level Vice President!
Anthology of Interest I,Farnsworth," That story was preposterous. Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria! This thing isn't worth the gold it's made of. [He pushes the What-If machine into a bin.] Anyway, the fing-longer seems to be arousing success."
Anthology of Interest I,Fry, Good work.
Anthology of Interest I,Leela, Congratulations!
Anthology of Interest I,Amy," Right on, Professor!"
Anthology of Interest I,Farnsworth, So that's what things would be like if I'd invented the fing-longer. [He sighs.] A man can dream though. A man can dream.
Anthology of Interest I,,
"I, Roommate",Bender, Hey!
"I, Roommate",Hermes," Fry, mon, if you're going to be living in the office you could at least be on time for work."
"I, Roommate",Fry, I'm sorry. I was up really late poking through people's desks.
"I, Roommate",Hermes," Alright, people. I will now outline today's 12-point agenda. We'll begin with point one, then race forward--"
"I, Roommate",Hermes," Concerning our pest problem  Somebody's been leaving food around and it's attracting owls. And I, for one, am getting tired of cleaning those owl traps. [A trap snaps and an owl hoots.] Now... [He flicks a button and a graph appears on the big screen. It is a straight line that inclines ever so slightly at the end.] As this shocking graph indicates, our water consumption has tripled in the last month. I notice Fry has been here for a month, so I'm appointing him head of a committee to find who's responsible. Fry? [Fry doesn't answer. He is taking a shower in the Emergency Chemical Burn Shower.] Am I cracking up, or is Fry's living here starting to get in the way of bus--"
"I, Roommate",Leela, What the hell are you doing? You're getting a huge dose of radiation!
"I, Roommate",Fry, [pointing to his hair] And great lift!
"I, Roommate",Leela, Do you know how long it's going to take me to recalibrate these engines?
"I, Roommate",Fry," Hey! When you look this good, you don't have to know anything."
"I, Roommate",Leela," Professor, We need to talk to you about Fry."
"I, Roommate",Bender," That's right, we want some money— Wait. What's this about Fry?"
"I, Roommate",Leela, He's a nice guy but we think it's about time he got his own place.
"I, Roommate",Farnsworth," Oh, fuff! He's not causing any trouble. Now, if you don't mind, I'm rather busy. I seem to have mislaid my alien mummy. [He picks a small box and opens it. It is empty.] This sarcophagus should contain the remains of Emperor Nimballa, who ruled Zuban 5 over 29 million years ago."
"I, Roommate",Fry," Hey, Professor, great jerky!"
"I, Roommate",Farnsworth," My God, this is an outrage! I was going to eat that mummy! Fry has got to go!"
"I, Roommate",Announcer," [voice-over; on TV] Bachelor Chow, now with flavour!"
"I, Roommate",Commentator, [voice-over; on TV] And Bigfoot is down!
"I, Roommate",Fry," Sheesh! 40,000 channels and only 150 have anything good on."
"I, Roommate",Announcer," [voice-over; on TV] All My Circuits is brought to you by Robo Fresh  Designed by a robot, for a robot."
"I, Roommate",Calculon," [on TV] I've been processing this for some time, Monique, and, well, will you marry me?"
"I, Roommate",Monique," [on TV] Oh, Calculon! [They kiss. Calculon takes out a ring box, opens it, takes out a nut and screws it onto Monique's finger.] It fits! Then you must know that I'm--"
"I, Roommate",Calculon," [on TV] Metric? I've always known. But for you, my darling, I'm willing to convert."
"I, Roommate",Fry," Hmm, must be a friend of theirs."
"I, Roommate",Bender," Fry, we've got to discuss your living arrangements."
"I, Roommate",Leela, We've all talked it over and--
"I, Roommate",Bender," Hey, All My Circuits! Move over."
"I, Roommate",Leela," Fry, sometimes in close quarters, people do inconsiderate things without realising it."
"I, Roommate",Fry, I know but I forgive you.
"I, Roommate",Leela," No, Fry, by ""close quarters"" I mean this office--"
"I, Roommate",Fry, Uh-huh.
"I, Roommate",Leela," And by ""people"" I mean you!"
"I, Roommate",Fry, Right.
"I, Roommate",Leela," And by ""inconsiderate"" I mean--"
"I, Roommate",Fry, Leela! We're trying to watch TV.
"I, Roommate",Bender, Yeah. Would you kindly shut your noise hole?
"I, Roommate",Fry," So, who's that weird-looking guy?"
"I, Roommate",Bender, That's a human.
"I, Roommate",Fry, What's he do?
"I, Roommate",Bender," Eh, the usual human stuff. He laughs, he learns, he loves."
"I, Roommate",Fry, Boring!
"I, Roommate",Human Friend, [on TV] Calculon? I thought you were in a coma.
"I, Roommate",Calculon," [on TV] That's what I wanted you to think with your soft, human brain."
"I, Roommate",Fry," Hey, uh, why is the TV getting smaller?"
"I, Roommate",Hermes, We'll bill you for the couch.
"I, Roommate",Bender," Cheer up, meatbag. You've barely touched your amoeba."
"I, Roommate",Fry, It looked good but I just don't feel like eating. You want it?
"I, Roommate",Bender," Nah, I'm trying to watch my input. I need plenty of wholesome, nutritious alcohol. [He drinks a glass.] The chemical energy keeps my fuel cells charged."
"I, Roommate",Fry, What are the cigars for?
"I, Roommate",Bender, They make me look cool.
"I, Roommate",Fry, I can't believe they threw me out like that. I must have been really acting like a jerk.
"I, Roommate",Bender," Yeah, but everybody's a jerk. You, me, this jerk. [He points over his shoulder at a man.] That's my philosophy. So, where you gonna stay?"
"I, Roommate",Fry, I don't know. Do refrigerators still come in cardboard boxes?
"I, Roommate",Bender," Yeah, but the rents are outrageous. Why don't you just come move in with me?"
"I, Roommate",Fry, Really? That'd be great! You sure I won't be imposing?
"I, Roommate",Bender," Nah, I've always wanted a pet."
"I, Roommate",Bender, Here we are. Your new home.
"I, Roommate",Fry," Cool! Y'know, I've never even seen a robot's apartment before."
"I, Roommate",Bender," Come on in, I'll give you the tour!"
"I, Roommate",Bender," Let's see, where to start. OK, this is the TV area, that over there's the breakfast nook, and over here is where you'll be living which is great because, until now, it's just been wasted space."
"I, Roommate",Fry, It's kinda cramped in here. I don't even have room to hang my clothes.
"I, Roommate",Bender," Look, pal, you've only got one set of clothes and you're not taking them off while I'm here. Well, I'm bushed. G'night."
"I, Roommate",Fry," Wait, Bender. Bender?"
"I, Roommate",Bender, [sleep-talking] Kill all humans ... kill all humans ... must kill all the humans.
"I, Roommate",Fry," Bender, wake up!"
"I, Roommate",Bender, I was having the most wonderful dream. I think you were in it.
"I, Roommate",Fry," Uh, listen, Bender. Uh, where's your bathroom?"
"I, Roommate",Bender, Bath what?
"I, Roommate",Fry, Bathroom.
"I, Roommate",Bender, What room?
"I, Roommate",Fry, Bathroom!
"I, Roommate",Bender, What what?
"I, Roommate",Fry," Ah, never mind!"
"I, Roommate",Bender," [sleep-talking] Hey, sexy mama, wanna kill all the humans?"
"I, Roommate",Leela, We sure are cheerful this morning.
"I, Roommate",Bender," Yeah, this past week with Fry's been a blast! Y'know, beneath this warm, sunny exterior beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot."
"I, Roommate",Leela, What happened to you?
"I, Roommate",Fry," Oh, it's Bender's apartment. He put in carpeting yesterday so now my head hits the ceiling. Hey, do you realise you're standing at a weird angle? [Leela twists his neck back properly.] Now you're OK."
"I, Roommate",Leela, Look at yourself. You're a wreck! You've got to find a new place to live.
"I, Roommate",Fry, [sexily] Is that an invitation?
"I, Roommate",Leela," Love your optimism, Fry. But seriously, you've got to tell Bender you're moving out."
"I, Roommate",Fry," Yeah, but he might get kind of upset. I don't think I can do that to him."
"I, Roommate",Bender," Hey, there's my little space heater."
"I, Roommate",Fry," Well, I'm moving out!"
"I, Roommate",Bender, What?
"I, Roommate",Fry," I'm sorry, Bender, but there's just not enough room."
"I, Roommate",Bender, Not enough room? My place is two cubic metres and we only take up 1.5 cubic metres. We've got room for a-whole-nother two-thirds of a person.
"I, Roommate",Leela, What if I just helped the two of you find a bigger apartment?
"I, Roommate",Bender, I don't know. I've got a lot of great memories in my old place. [He presses some buttons in his chest cabinet.] And now they're gone.
"I, Roommate",Underwater house salesman," Sure, it ain't one of them la-de-da above-ground places. But if you like dank, hey, forget about it!"
"I, Roommate",Leela, At least it's got a great view.
"I, Roommate",Bender, What the--?
"I, Roommate",Underwater House Salesman, Excuse me. I gotta go change a lightbulb.
"I, Roommate",Leela, Wow! Now this is fantastic!
"I, Roommate",Fry, Hmm. I'm not sure we want to pay for a dimension we're not going to use.
"I, Roommate",Fry," Well, I give up. What's the catch?"
"I, Roommate",Suspiciously fantastic apartment salesman," Oh, no catch. Although we 'are technically in New Jersey."
"I, Roommate",Fry, Not one place even remotely liveable.
"I, Roommate",Farnsworth," Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? To shreds, you say. Very well then. [He hangs up.] Sad, sad, terrible, gruesome news about my colleague, Dr. Mbutu."
"I, Roommate",Leela, Was his apartment rent-controlled?
"I, Roommate",Leela, Wow. This is beautiful.
"I, Roommate",Bender, What's with all the crap?
"I, Roommate",Leela, It's not crap.
"I, Roommate",Hattie, Dr. Mbutu collected this crap while he was exploring the watcha-call-it ... universe!
"I, Roommate",Fry," Well, this place has everything except the only thing I care about  A TV."
"I, Roommate",Hattie," It's got a TV, you young watcha-call-it ... idiot!"
"I, Roommate",Fry, Ooh!
"I, Roommate",Bender," Whoa, slow down! This place just doesn't feel like home. It just isn't ... cosy. [Fry opens a closet and Bender walks inside.] Ah. I can barely move! [He closes the door.] (from inside) It's perfect!"
"I, Roommate",Fry," Man, it's a total sty! For the first time in a thousand years, I feel like I'm home."
"I, Roommate",Bender," Yeah! It's gonna be fun on the bun! Y'know, Fry, of all the friends I've had, you're the first."
"I, Roommate",Hermes," Hey, mon!"
"I, Roommate",Leela," Happy housewarming, Fry! [Fry stares blankly at Leela's gift.] It's a miniature fruit salad tree."
"I, Roommate",Fry," Ooh! [He takes off a miniature banana, peels it, eats it and tosses the skin on the floor. Amy slips over it and screams.] Hey, Amy!"
"I, Roommate",Amy, Hey!
"I, Roommate",Farnsworth," This is for you, Fry [He hands Fry a small, gift-wrapped mummy.] Zevulon the Great. He's teriyaki style."
"I, Roommate",Bender, Wow! Heavy-drinking crowd! [He belches fire.] I'd better go out for more beer.
"I, Roommate",Fry," Hey, hang on, All My Circuits is about to start!"
"I, Roommate",Bender," I know, but I need alcohol to power up my batteries. If Calculon's wedding doesn't go just right I'll be emotionally and electrically drained."
"I, Roommate",Fry, Hey!
"I, Roommate",Hermes, These are mighty tasty!
"I, Roommate",Zoidberg, Thank you. I made them myself.
"I, Roommate",Fry, Sh! The wedding's about to start!
"I, Roommate",Preacherbot," [on TV] If anyone here objects to this union, let them speak now or forever hold their—"
"I, Roommate",Fry, Is he objecting or backing up?
"I, Roommate",Amy, Looks like both.
"I, Roommate",Calculon," [on TV] I'm afraid my half-brother is correct. You see, I have a terrible secret and that secret is--"
"I, Roommate",Amy," Oh, this isn't right."
"I, Roommate",Hermes," Oh, come on!"
"I, Roommate",Farnsworth, Fix it!
"I, Roommate",Bender," Hey, what happened to the TV?"
"I, Roommate",Fry, It just went out.
"I, Roommate",Bender, This is an outrage! I'm gonna go yell at the manager!
"I, Roommate",Hermes, Alright!
"I, Roommate",Fry," [shouting] Come back, Bender! It's working!"
"I, Roommate",Calculon," [on TV] To reiterate, my terrible secret is--"
"I, Roommate",Fry, It's out again.
"I, Roommate",Bender, What? That's the last straw!
"I, Roommate",Fry, It's back on!
"I, Roommate",Hattie, Pardon me. I don't mean to pry into what you're doing in here with the crab and the one-eyed lady and the Chinese girl but everyone on this floor is having trouble with their TV reception.
"I, Roommate",Bender, Yeah! And you'd better get rid of whatever's causing it or we're outta this dump!
"I, Roommate",Hattie," Relax, sonny. This kajigger'll find the source of the interference."
"I, Roommate",Tenant #1, What's going on?
"I, Roommate",Tenant #2, We want our TV back!
"I, Roommate",Hattie, There's your problem.
"I, Roommate",Amy," Oh, my God! Bender, it's your thingy!"
"I, Roommate",Randy, Then get rid of it!
"I, Roommate",Tenant #1, Get out!
"I, Roommate",Bender, You people are nuts. My antenna never interfered with my old TV.
"I, Roommate",Leela, You had cable. This is satellite.
"I, Roommate",Farnsworth, Obviously your thoughts are being transmitted on the same frequency.
"I, Roommate",Huge-assed woman, They're on my cell phone too.
"I, Roommate",Bender," Madam, I believe you're mistaken!"
"I, Roommate",Bender," [thinking; on phone] Wow, that lady's got a huge ass!"
"I, Roommate",Bender," Those could be anyone's thoughts, fat ass!"
"I, Roommate",Randy, The robot has to go!
"I, Roommate",Tenant #1, Yeah.
"I, Roommate",Tenant #3, Get him out of here!
"I, Roommate",Hattie," Well, you heard the mob!"
"I, Roommate",Bender," Fine! Come on, Fry, let's move to that apartment that smelled like a sewer. You liked that one, right?"
"I, Roommate",Fry," It's tempting, but, well, I am already kinda settled in here."
"I, Roommate",Bender, Or we could live underground with the mutants. A little fire'll show 'em who's boss!
"I, Roommate",Fry," Uh, listen, is there maybe some way we could do this with you going and me not going?"
"I, Roommate",Bender, I don't understand.
"I, Roommate",Fry," Well, you were gonna live in the closet anyway. Won't you be just as happy back in your old place?"
"I, Roommate",Bender," But, then we wouldn't be roommates."
"I, Roommate",Fry, I'll come visit sometime. And you can visit me here.
"I, Roommate",Hattie, No he can't.
"I, Roommate",Fry," Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out. This way we'll both be happy."
"I, Roommate",Bender," [downbeat] Happy. Yeah, that's Bender. Always happy."
"I, Roommate",Randy," Hey, the TV's back on!"
"I, Roommate",Preacherbot," [on TV] We are gathered here to mourn the death of Calculon; industrialist, private eye, friend."
"I, Roommate",Calculon, [on TV] Mind if I give the eulogy?
"I, Roommate",Monique, [on TV] Calculon! You're alive!
"I, Roommate",Randy, Calculon's back!
"I, Roommate",Farnsworth," Right, so long."
"I, Roommate",Zoidberg, Goodbye.
"I, Roommate",Amy, [crying] Do you think Calculon's evil twin will ever walk again?
"I, Roommate",Hermes," I don't know, Amy. I just don't know."
"I, Roommate",Fry," Hey, thanks for coming."
"I, Roommate",Leela," Fry, you're Bender's best friend. How could you let that mob kick him out?"
"I, Roommate",Fry," Ah, come on. Bender loves mobs."
"I, Roommate",Leela, Only when he's in them and you know it. You really hurt his feelings.
"I, Roommate",Fry, Don't girl me with that girl stuff. Bender and me are guys. Guys don't have feelings.
"I, Roommate",Leela," Bender's not a guy, he's a robot."
"I, Roommate",Fry, Same thing.
"I, Roommate",Bender, It's so big and empty.
"I, Roommate",Bender," My roommate's gone. And all he left behind was an eyelash and three skin flakes. [He takes out a beer from his chest cabinet.] Oh, what's the point?"
"I, Roommate",Leela," Bender? [He turns around and she gasps.] My God, you're a mess!"
"I, Roommate",Bender, Leave me alone!
"I, Roommate",Leela," Look at that five o'clock rust. You've been up all night not drinking, haven't you?"
"I, Roommate",Bender, Hey. What I don't do is none of your business.
"I, Roommate",Leela," Please, Bender. Have some malt liquor. If not for yourself then for the people who love you."
"I, Roommate",Bender, I hate the people who love me and they hate me.
"I, Roommate",Leela," Oh, now look. It's obvious you miss being Fry's roommate. But there's got to be a better way to deal with this."
"I, Roommate",Bender, Like how? Having my antenna removed?
"I, Roommate",Leela," Well, if that would work."
"I, Roommate",Bender, Are you crazy? That's Little Bender you're talking about. I can't cut it off. You're not a robot or a man so you wouldn't understand. I gotta get out of here.
"I, Roommate",Leela, Wait! I want you to look me in the eye and promise you won't get behind the wheel without some kind of alcoholic beverage in your hand.
"I, Roommate",Bender, I promise nothing!
"I, Roommate",Fry, What up?
"I, Roommate",Leela, I can't just stand by and be silent about Bender anymore.
"I, Roommate",Fry, Silent? You've been meddling for two solid weeks.
"I, Roommate",Leela, Well I can't just do that anymore. Your best friend is out there somewhere destroying himself.
"I, Roommate",Fry, Really? I didn't think he'd miss this apartment that much.
"I, Roommate",Leela," He doesn't care about the apartment, he cares about you. And you turned your back on him."
"I, Roommate",Fry," Oh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew where he was I'd go talk to him."
"I, Roommate",Fry," Oh, stupid TV! [Enter Bender.] Bender! You're blind-stinking sober!"
"I, Roommate",Bender, That's right! I'm sober and crazy and I don't know what I might do!
"I, Roommate",Fry, Don't do it!
"I, Roommate",Bender," I don't know what it is yet. Oh, yeah, now I remember. I thought I could live alone, but I can't. So, I'm gonna do what it takes to be your roommate again."
"I, Roommate",Leela, Bender! Stop!
"I, Roommate",Fry, Cutting Leela's head off won't solve anything!
"I, Roommate",Bender," No, I'm going to chop off my antenna."
"I, Roommate",Fry," Hey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give you a hand?"
"I, Roommate",Leela, Fry! Don't help him mutilate himself.
"I, Roommate",Fry, But it's a useless antenna. It's not like he's a ham radio or something.
"I, Roommate",Bender, I'm gonna do it! I'm really gonna do it! Don't try and stop me! Here goes.
"I, Roommate",Fry," Hey, it works! The static's gone."
"I, Roommate",Human Friend," [on TV] I hate that this came between us, Calculon."
"I, Roommate",Calculon, [on TV] Me too. I'm filled with a large number of powerful emotions.
"I, Roommate",Human Friend, [on TV] You're my best friend. I'm sorry I treated you so badly.
"I, Roommate",Calculon," [on TV] Apology accepted. After all, you're only human."
"I, Roommate",Leela, You guys could learn a lesson from those two.
"I, Roommate",Fry, She's right.
"I, Roommate",Bender," You're my best friend, Fry, I'm sorry I treated you so badly."
"I, Roommate",Fry," Apology accepted. After all, you're only human."
"I, Roommate",Leela," Wait a minute! You did it all backwards. [Fry and Bender stare blankly.] Fry's the one who should be-- [Fry and Bender keep staring.] Oh, never mind!"
"I, Roommate",Fry, What's wrong?
"I, Roommate",Bender, Nothing. I guess I'm just going to have to get used to being half a robot.
"I, Roommate",Fry," Aw, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, if we found your antenna could they still reattach it?"
"I, Roommate",Bender, Maybe. If we get it on ice right away.
"I, Roommate",Smitty, Bingo!
"I, Roommate",URL, You call that an antenna?
"I, Roommate",Bender," This time, you'll have all the human comfort. We'll get a couple of toilets, some food cookers, maybe a puppy."
"I, Roommate",Fry, It's good to be home.
"I, Roommate",Bender," It sure is. By the way, I saved your stuff."
"I, Roommate",Fry," So that's where those skin flakes went. Hmm, do you think this fruit tree's going to get enough light?"
"I, Roommate",Bender, There's a window in the closet.
"I, Roommate",Fry," This is huge! Bender, why don't I just live in here?"
"I, Roommate",Bender," In a closet? Oh, humans!"
"I, Roommate",,
War Is the H-Word,Fry," Hm, Spider, Hubble, Nitrogum ... ooh, Big Pink! It's the only gum with the breath-freshening power of ham."
War Is the H-Word,Bender, And it pinkens your teeth while you chew.
War Is the H-Word,Clerk," Alright, sergeant, $100 worth of pixie stix and porno mags with your 5% military discount comes to $95. [He hands over the money, picks up his bag and leaves. Fry slaps his gum on the counter and the clerk rings it up.] That'll be 40 cents."
War Is the H-Word,Fry, I believe you're forgetting about our 5% military discount.
War Is the H-Word,Clerk, Well that's only for people in the military.
War Is the H-Word,Bender, What? This is the worst kind of discrimination. The kind against me!
War Is the H-Word,Clerk," Alright, look. Our policy is  If for any reason you're not completely satisfied, I hate you."
War Is the H-Word,Bender," OK, now I'm mad!"
War Is the H-Word,Fry," Full price for gum? That dog won't hunt, monsignor."
War Is the H-Word,Bender," Hello. We're here because we, uh, love our planet!"
War Is the H-Word,Recruitment Officer," Sign here on the dotted line, patriots, and I'll give you your discount cards."
War Is the H-Word,Fry," Just out of curiosity, we could use the cards to buy gum, then immediately quit the army, right?"
War Is the H-Word,Bender," You know, playing you all for chumps?"
War Is the H-Word,Recruitment Officer," Correct. There's no obligation. [Fry and Bender laugh as they sign. The man takes their papers back.] Unless, of course, war were declared."
War Is the H-Word,Fry, What's that?
War Is the H-Word,Recruitment Officer, War were declared.
War Is the H-Word,Farnsworth," Now be careful, Fry. And if you kill anyone, make sure to eat their heart, to gain their courage. Their rich, tasty courage."
War Is the H-Word,Hermes, I don't want you to worry about your jobs while you're away. That's why I'm firing you now.
War Is the H-Word,Leela, I wanna enlist. My friends always die if I'm not there to save them.
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," Sorry, but the army's instituted a men-only policy."
War Is the H-Word,Leela, What?
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," It's shameful, I agree. In the olden days, I proudly fought alongside female troops, shoulder to, uh, shoulder. Alas, after a series of deadly blunders caused by distracting low-cut fatigues and lots of harmless pinching, the army decided women weren't fit for service. Not when I'm in charge."
War Is the H-Word,Leela," You know, Zapp, someone ought to teach you a lesson."
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," If it's a lesson in love, watch out; I suffer from a very sexy learning disability. What do I call it, Kif?"
War Is the H-Word,Kif," ""Sex-lexia""."
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," Men, you're lucky men. Soon you'll all be fighting for your planet. Many of you will be dying for your planet. A few of you will be forced through a fine mesh screen for your planet. They will be the luckiest of all."
War Is the H-Word,Bender," Great, we're gonna die."
War Is the H-Word,Fry, And this ham gum is all bones.
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," Now to present the logistics of our mission, the Commander-in-Chief. Please welcome the original Gerber Baby, Earth President Richard M. Nixon."
War Is the H-Word,Nixon," This is the brass ring, fellas. [Kif presses a button, the lights dim and a holographic image of a planet appears above the soldiers.] Planet Spheron One!"
War Is the H-Word,Fry, Cool effect!
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," It's a desolate, ugly little planet with absolutely no natural resources or strategic value. Questions?"
War Is the H-Word,Soldier #1, Why is this Godforsaken planet worth dying for?
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," Don't ask me, you're the one who's going to be dying."
War Is the H-Word,Fry," Uh, just so we'll know, who's the enemy?"
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," A valid question. [The lights come back on.] We know nothing about their language, their history or what they look like. But we can assume this  They stand for everything we don't stand for. Also, they told me you guys look like dorks."
War Is the H-Word,Bender, They look like dorks!
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," What's the matter, private? Tent got your tongue? [chuckling] Tent got your... [talking] Kif, write that down and send it to ""Humor In Uniform""."
War Is the H-Word,Fry, Whoa! Check out that guy. He makes Speedy Gonzales look like Regular Gonzales!
War Is the H-Word,Kif," That new recruit is phenomenal, sir."
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," Yes. He edged out my old mark by two seconds ... [Kif frowns.] ... and 16 minutes ... and 12 hours. I do plan to finish someday, Kif. Good hustle, soldier."
War Is the H-Word,Leela," [disguised, deeper voice] Uh, sorry, sir. I was still in attack mode. You know how testosterone is."
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," As a bubbling Crock-Pot of male hormones, I sure do. What's your name, private?"
War Is the H-Word,Leela," [disguised, deeper voice] Lee-- [She covers her mouth.] La ... man. La Man ... Lemon! Lee Lemon, sir."
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," Lemon, you're a man's man. You're a man's man's man. More importantly, your hand, while firm and masculine, is soft as a velvet child. What lotion do you use?"
War Is the H-Word,Leela," [disguised, deeper voice] Pert and Popular, sir."
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," Roger that. Kif, get me ten cases of Pert and Popular."
War Is the H-Word,Kif," What shall I do with your Jergens, sir?"
War Is the H-Word,Zapp, Squirt it on some homeless man with dry elbows. [Leela sneaks off.] Private Lee Lemon may well be the finest recruit I've seen in all my years of service. That young man fills me with hope and some other emotions that are weird and deeply confusing to me.
War Is the H-Word,Kif, Ew!
War Is the H-Word,Zapp, [sexfully] Hello!
War Is the H-Word,Nixon," Mmm! Now that's a nice rosé. So, anyway, we open up the panda crate and, wouldn't you know it, the damn thing's dead! Up-chucked it's bamboo. True story."
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," Uh-huh, uh-huh. That's whatever you were talking about for you."
War Is the H-Word,Fry, Mind if we sit with you?
War Is the H-Word,Leela," [disguised, deeper voice] Uh, hey, why the hell would I? We're all guys here. Sweaty, hairy, gassy guys."
War Is the H-Word,Fry, Good point ... I guess.
War Is the H-Word,Bender," You're my kind of soldier, Lemon. A foul-mouthed, barrel-chested, beer-bellied pile of ugly muscle."
War Is the H-Word,Hick, So. Any you fellas got a special lady back home?
War Is the H-Word,Fry," Well, I sort of a have a thing for this girl I work with."
War Is the H-Word,Leela," Really? [disguised, deeper voice] What type is she? You know, blonde, or Chinese, or Cyclops?"
War Is the H-Word,Fry, Cyclops.
War Is the H-Word,Leela," [disguised, deeper voice] Aww, she sounds sweet."
War Is the H-Word,Bender," But sweet girls aren't for you, eh? You hard-fighting, hard-farting, ugly, ugly son of a--"
War Is the H-Word,Leela," [disguised, deeper voice] Stop! Stop flattering me!"
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," [shouting] Ten hut! [Everyone sits to attention.] Well, well, well. If it isn't Lee Lemon  The flaming star of Brannigan's Rough Rangers. Say, uh, Lemon, do you like to read? I just got a great book on tape. It's about life in Ancient Greece and--"
War Is the H-Word,Leela," [disguised, deeper voice] Sir, the alarm. I think I'd better--"
War Is the H-Word,Zapp, Shh. Don't talk. Just go.
War Is the H-Word,Nixon, We are now in position above Spheron One. This is the moment we were training for all yesterday afternoon.
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," And now for the battle plan  As you all know, the key to victory is the element of surprise. Surprise!"
War Is the H-Word,Fry, It's creepy here.
War Is the H-Word,Soldier #1, This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.
War Is the H-Word,Fry, And then the battle's not so bad?
War Is the H-Word,Soldier #1," Oh, right. I forgot about the battle."
War Is the H-Word,Fry, What's happening?
War Is the H-Word,Hick, Holy shoot! Lookie!
War Is the H-Word,Fry, The enemy! They're balls!
War Is the H-Word,Leela," Charge your gun, Fry."
War Is the H-Word,Fry," Oh, right."
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," Watch where you're shooting, private! You spooked Felicity. [He pats the horse's neck.] There, there, boy."
War Is the H-Word,Soldier #1, [hoarse] Give this to my son.
War Is the H-Word,Bender, You got it!
War Is the H-Word,Soldier #1, [hoarse] Wait. I didn't tell you where he lives.
War Is the H-Word,Bender," Hey, I think your son might also like those boots."
War Is the H-Word,Hick," Cover us, buddy. You've got the only wounded-up positron shooter. [Fry quivers behind a rock as balls bounce towards him. He screams, blasts a hole in the ground and hides in it. The balls bounce past.] Fry, you emu-bellied coward!"
War Is the H-Word,Fry, [shouting] Bender! No!
War Is the H-Word,Bender," If they put me on a stamp, tell them to use the young Bender."
War Is the H-Word,P.A. Announcer," [on tannoy] Incoming wounded. All operating personnel report to tent four, repeat, four-- I mean five! Repeat, four."
War Is the H-Word,Nurse," Are you ready to operate, doctor?"
War Is the H-Word,Zoidberg," [washing his claws] I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery. [He laughs.] I kid! I kid!"
War Is the H-Word,Zoidberg, Scalpel. [The nurse hands him a scalpel and he cuts something inside the hick.] Blood bucket. [She hands him a bucket and he puts it under the operating table.] Priest. Next patient.
War Is the H-Word,iHawk," Gee, Zoidberg, leave some for the enemy to kill."
War Is the H-Word,Nurse, Leave Dr. Zoidberg alone! He has twice the training you do.
War Is the H-Word,iHawk," Yeah, he's a doctor and a butcher!"
War Is the H-Word,Zoidberg," See, this is how it starts. First with he jokes, then comes the heavy stuff."
War Is the H-Word,iHawk, When will the killing end?
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," Look at this sissy, Kif. While others were fighting and dying pointlessly, he was hiding in a hole, wallowing in a pool of his own cowardice."
War Is the H-Word,Fry, That wasn't cowardice.
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," I'm de-promoting you, soldier. Kif, what's the most humiliating job there is?"
War Is the H-Word,Kif, Being your assistant.
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," Wrong! Being your assistant! Private Fry, you shall henceforth serve as Kif's assistant."
War Is the H-Word,Fry, That doesn't sound too bad.
War Is the H-Word,Kif," You speak when I tell you to, you filthy worm!"
War Is the H-Word,Zoidberg, I'm afraid he's gone.
War Is the H-Word,Hick," Whoa, doc, I ain't dead."
War Is the H-Word,Zoidberg," Excuse me, I believe I'm the doctor."
War Is the H-Word,iHawk," Believe it all you want, that won't make it true. [He laughs then flicks his switch from ""irreverent"" to ""maudlin"".] This isn't a war, it's a murder. [He flicks it back.] This isn't a war, it's a moider!"
War Is the H-Word,Hick," Bender, old buddy, hang in there."
War Is the H-Word,Zapp, Here lies the bravest soldier I've seen since my mirror got grease on it. I hereby order that in Bender's honour he be melted down and made into a statue of himself.
War Is the H-Word,Nixon," Slow down there, Starsky, I'm up to something here. I want this robot fixed. Fixed like Kennedy fixed the 1960 election. Damn bean-eating war hero!"
War Is the H-Word,Nurse," Are you read to operate, doctor?"
War Is the H-Word,iHawk," I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery."
War Is the H-Word,Zoidberg, That's my joke! I'll kill you!
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," Ah! Pre-war scotch! [Enter Bender with wheels attached to his side.] Welcome, Lieutenant Bender. You're looking sharp."
War Is the H-Word,Bender, I got wheels! With clickety-clack-ers.
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," Damnit, Kif, where's the little umbrella? That's what makes it a scotch-on-the-rocks!"
War Is the H-Word,Kif," Actually, sir--"
War Is the H-Word,Zapp, Make me a new one.
War Is the H-Word,Kif," Use a brush, you dunderhead! And mix these mixed nuts. I see two almonds touching!"
War Is the H-Word,Nixon," Now, listen here, Bender. This war is in danger of going all quagmire on me, so I'm sending you on one last mission."
War Is the H-Word,Bender, Hot diggidy daffodil!
War Is the H-Word,Nixon, A mission of peace.
War Is the H-Word,Bender, [disappointed] Oh!
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," You'll be negotiating with the aliens' mysterious leaders, the Brain Balls. They've got a lot of brains and they've got a lot of kutzpa!"
War Is the H-Word,Nixon," Accompanying you will be our top peace negotiator, Henry Kissenger."
War Is the H-Word,Kissenger, How are you?
War Is the H-Word,Bender, Is he any good?
War Is the H-Word,Nixon," Looking like that, he talked his way into Jill St. John's bed. Nuff said!"
War Is the H-Word,Nixon," [singing] I'm so dizzy,"
War Is the H-Word,"My head is spinning,",
War Is the H-Word,"Like a whirlpool,",
War Is the H-Word,It never ends.,
War Is the H-Word,Zapp, A little lower. Lower. Lower. A lot lower. Too low! ... Lower!
War Is the H-Word,Fry," [singing] I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh."
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," Private Lemon, no need to leave. [He opens the door to his shower stall and steps out.]  My stall just became free."
War Is the H-Word,Leela," [disguised, deeper voice] Maybe you should put on a towel, sir."
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," Right! Right! [He walks away and Leela hurries into the stall and shuts the door. Zapp has wrapped the towel around his head and squirts something onto his hand.] I'm about to try the new lotion you recommended. [sexfully] If I should accidentally put too much on my hands, perhaps I could rub it onto you."
War Is the H-Word,Nixon, Brannigan!
War Is the H-Word,Zapp, Hm?
War Is the H-Word,Nixon," My God, cover yourself. I didn't live a thousand years and travel a quadrillion miles to look at another man's gizmo."
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," Uh, sorry, Mr. President, I-I didn't realise. Kif, raise him up about nipple-high."
War Is the H-Word,Nixon," Come on, Brannigan, stuff yourself into a uniform. We've gotta get off this planet before the bomb goes off."
War Is the H-Word,Leela," [disguised, deeper voice] Bomb? What bomb?"
War Is the H-Word,Zapp, The one we had the doctors implant in that gullible Bender robot.
War Is the H-Word,Nixon, Zapp. Zapp!
War Is the H-Word,Zapp, Hm?
War Is the H-Word,Nixon, Inspect the troops later. It's time to activate the bomb.
War Is the H-Word,Kissenger," Now, as for economic co-operation--"
War Is the H-Word,Bender, Whoa! Scuse me.
War Is the H-Word,P.A. Announcer, [on tannoy] Attention  All personnel evacuate the planet immediately. And not just because it's meat loaf night.
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," Come along, Lemon, before this whole dump blows up."
War Is the H-Word,Leela," [disguised, deeper voice] Uh, Commander? Could you tell me when the bomb is exploding?"
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," Of course, my significant soldier. The bomb is voice-activated. It will detonate the instant the robot unwittingly speaks a certain word."
War Is the H-Word,Fry," What's the word, uh, sir?"
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," It's the one word the robot uses more than any other. We got it from this convenient database of his 10 most frequently-used words. [He presses a button on the database and a list comes up.] Number 10, chump; number nine, chumpette; number eight, yours; number seven, up; number six, pimpmobile; number five, bite; number four, my ... [Leela gasps.] ... number three, shiny; number two, daffodil. And Bender's number one most frequently-uttered word, the word which, if uttered, will blow up this entire planet  Ass."
War Is the H-Word,Fry, We don't have long!
War Is the H-Word,Brain Ball #1," We demand bouncing, followed by rolling, followed by rolling of the third type."
War Is the H-Word,Kissenger, Say what?
War Is the H-Word,Bender," My chair's too hard. It's a real pain in the, uh, whattya call it? Lower back! Yeah, that whole region."
War Is the H-Word,Fry," OK, I gotta break down that gate, beat up those three guards, steal that chopper and rescue Bender."
War Is the H-Word,Leela, Hi-yah!
War Is the H-Word,Fry," Hey, I did it! Wait, that's not me."
War Is the H-Word,Leela, [shouting] Come on! We gotta save Bender.
War Is the H-Word,Fry," You wanna save him too, Lemon? You barely know him."
War Is the H-Word,Leela," Fry, don't you recognise me?"
War Is the H-Word,Fry, [squinting] Hermes?
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," Lee? When will I see you again? [He sees Leela and Fry holding hands and gasps.] The two of you are good friends? But I thought we would be good friends. [contemptuous] Well, let's see how friendly you get when you're sharing a prison cell!"
War Is the H-Word,Leela," Hey, Zapp!"
War Is the H-Word,Zapp, Leela!
War Is the H-Word,Fry, Leela!
War Is the H-Word,Zapp," So it's you I've been attracted to! Oh, God, I've never been so happy to be beaten up by a woman."
War Is the H-Word,Leela, Let's do it again sometime.
War Is the H-Word,Brain Ball #2, The Elders tell of a young ball much like you. He bounced three metres in the air. Then he bounced 1.8 metres in the air. Then he bounced four metres in the air. Do I make myself clear?
War Is the H-Word,Kissenger," Mr. Ambassador, our people tell the same story. Oy."
War Is the H-Word,Bender," These balls are making me testy. If they don't stop bouncing and jiggling, I swear I'm gonna shove this treaty up their-- Wait a second. Where do you shove things up a ball?"
War Is the H-Word,Kissenger, This isn't a productive area of discussion.
War Is the H-Word,Leela, We're here. I followed the bouncing balls. [Fry stands at the door with a parachute on his back.] I'll keep the chopper at a safe altitude while you parachute down.
War Is the H-Word,Fry," OK, my best friend's life is at stake. I can finally prove that I'm not a coward. [He puts on his helmet and sighs.] Will you push me?"
War Is the H-Word,Leela, [shouting] I already did!
War Is the H-Word,Fry," [shouting] Thank you! [He pulls his ripcord and hits the ground as soon as the parachute deploys. Balls bounce on him and he kicks a few away and rides one like a space hopper.] At last, war has made me into a man."
War Is the H-Word,Kissenger," Please, gentlemen, we must put an end to the bloodshed. We have all seen too many body bags and ball sacks."
War Is the H-Word,Brain Ball #1, We cannot condone bouncing of the seventh variety.
War Is the H-Word,Bender, Enough of this crap! I'm catching the next pimpmobile outta here! But before I go I have one thing to say. [He climbs onto the table and turns around.] Bite my shiny metal--
War Is the H-Word,Fry, Stop! You can't say the next word.
War Is the H-Word,Bender," Up yours, chump, I said it 906 times before lunch."
War Is the H-Word,Fry," Bender, if you say the A-word, you'll blow this planet straight to the H-word!"
War Is the H-Word,Kissenger," Young man, you have the bravery of a hero and breath as fresh as a summer ham. [Fry smiles and Bender laughs.] What? What is funny?"
War Is the H-Word,Bender," Bender's got the upper hand now. [He closes his door and turns to the Brain Balls.] The name of the game is ""Make Bender Happy Or He Blows Up The Planet"". [Everyone gasps.] I'd rather die and take everybody with me than sit here one more minute listening to these idiots talk about bouncing!"
War Is the H-Word,Brain Ball #1," Please, stay calm. There's no need to bounce of the handle."
War Is the H-Word,Bender," That's it, I'm saying it! ""A"" is for--"
War Is the H-Word,Brain Ball #1," Wait, stop! We give in to all of Earth's demands. The war is over. Our home planet is yours."
War Is the H-Word,Fry," Alright! Hey, wait a minute! This is your home planet? We're the evil, invading aliens?"
War Is the H-Word,Brain Ball #2, Correct.
War Is the H-Word,Bender, Then I guess you learned a valuable lesson  Don't mess with Earth.
War Is the H-Word,Brain Ball #1, May you bounce in peace.
War Is the H-Word,Bender, Get the hell off my planet.
War Is the H-Word,Farnsworth," Well, that's it. Let's reactivate him. [shouting] Wake up!"
War Is the H-Word,Bender," Hey, chumps and chumpettes. Did you get the bomb out? Can I go back to saying the word I love to say?"
War Is the H-Word,Zoidberg, I'm sorry but we couldn't remove it.
War Is the H-Word,Farnsworth," It's stuck in there with glue or something, I don't know."
War Is the H-Word,Bender," [ironic] Well, this is just great! What's the point of living if I can't say ""ass""? [He gasps.] Hey, I didn't blow up! Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass! Alright! I'm back in the saddle!"
War Is the H-Word,Leela, We couldn't disarm the bomb so we reset the word that triggers it.
War Is the H-Word,Amy, It's from the list of words you almost never say.
War Is the H-Word,Bender," That's using your ass. So, what's the word?"
War Is the H-Word,Hermes, We think it's better if you don't know.
War Is the H-Word,Bender," Oh, come on. I'm not gonna say it. Please? Ooh, is it ""please""?"
War Is the H-Word,Fry, No.
War Is the H-Word,Bender," Hm, words I never say. Oh, I know! ""Thanks""!"
War Is the H-Word,Leela," Bender, stop trying to destroy the world."
War Is the H-Word,Bender," Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it ""sorry""? No. ""Fun-derful""? Uh, ""non-alcoholic""?"
War Is the H-Word,Amy, Quit it!
War Is the H-Word,Fry, Bender!
War Is the H-Word,Hermes," Stop it, mon!"
War Is the H-Word,Zoidberg, Enough already!
War Is the H-Word,Bender," [from lab] ""Compassion""? ""Shrimptoast""? ""Antiquing""? [There is an explosion.] I'm alright!"
War Is the H-Word,,
The Honking,Doctorbot, Notify his survivors.
The Honking,Bender, [singing] B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender! [He walks into the room. Leela and Amy read magazines and Fry looks at a copy of Playbot. Bender dances.] B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender! Sayin' B-E-N-D-ER--
The Honking,Hermes," Mail call! Amy, here's your designer lingerie catalogue. Fry, Sadie's Bra Parade and, Leela, Bulk Underpants Outlet."
The Honking,Leela, You buy one pound of underwear and you're on their list forever.
The Honking,Hermes, And for Bender-- Uh-oh! A black-bordered envelope.
The Honking,Amy," Oh, no! Someone you know must've died."
The Honking,Bender," I hope it was one of my enemies; those guys suck! [He opens the envelope and gasps.] Oh, no! My uncle Vladimir."
The Honking,Fry," Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. When's the funeral?"
The Honking,Bender," Tomorrow, at the family castle. Followed by the reading of his will. [He screws up the letter and throws it behind him.] Well, I'm rich. Goodbye, losers, whom I've always hated! [He walks through the door then comes back.] C'mon, it'll be fun!"
The Honking,Bender," Uh, pardon me, my good simpleton. Could you take us to yon castle?"
The Honking,Robot #1, Some say unholy things happen up there.
The Honking,Robot #2, For example  All of us say that.
The Honking,Farnsworth, Fuf! Superstitious robot mumbo-jumbo.
The Honking,Robot #2," Mumbo, perhaps. Jumbo, perhaps not! With all your modern science are you any closer to understanding the mystery of how a robot walks or talks?"
The Honking,Farnsworth," Yes, you idiot. [He opens the robot's chest cabinet.] The circuit diagram is right here on the inside of your case."
The Honking,Robot #2, I choose to believe what I was programmed to believe.
The Honking,Robot #2, I will go this far and no further.
The Honking,Preacherbot, I now commend Vladimir's remains to the earth. Filings to filings; rust to rust.
The Honking,Execu-Tor," [reading] To my loyal butler, You There, for his decades of service, I leave a pittance, to be paid in 20 equal instalments of one-twentieth of a pittance each. [You There bursts into tears.] To my lazy, spoiled son, Tandy, who never learned the value of a dollar, I leave my entire $10 million fortune."
The Honking,Tandy, [whispering] Is that a lot?
The Honking,Execu-Tor," [reading] And to my loving nephew, Bender, assuming he's not responsible for my death, I leave my castle."
The Honking,Bender, Yes! Let's stay there tonight.
The Honking,Execu-Tor, [reading] On condition that he spend one night within its walls.
The Honking,Bender," Oh, man, there's always a catch!"
The Honking,Bender," Ah! I got a good vibe from this place  Nice long dinner table, quiet, well-behaved spiders, graveyard-adjacent. Yep! It's gonna be--"
The Honking,Leela, What is it?
The Honking,Bender," That painting, the eyes are watching me!"
The Honking,Farnsworth, Hmm. [He traces his glass backwards and forwards in front of the picture. The eyes follow the glass.] It has motor eye sensors attached to motion detectors.
The Honking,Bender," So does my butt, but I don't frame it and put it on the wall! Although-- [The MS Windows intro music plays, as if from nowhere. Someone laughs.] What's that?"
The Honking,Zoidberg," I don't know, but it's infectious!"
The Honking,Bender," No doubt about it, this place is haunted."
The Honking,Hermes," Don't be silly, mon. The last ghost died over 200 years ago."
The Honking,Bender, The last human ghost. But robot ghosts?
The Honking,Leela, [reading] 0101100101. [talking] What does it mean?
The Honking,Bender, It's just gibberish. [He turns and gasps as he sees the numbers reflected in a mirror à la The Shining.] [reading] 1010011010?
The Honking,Bender, Uncle Vladimir!
The Honking,Vladimir-Ghost," Come, Bender. You'll like being dead!"
The Honking,Bender, That's what they said about being alive.
The Honking,Robot Ghosts," [chanting] Join us! Join us! Join us, Bender!"
The Honking,Farnsworth," Just as I suspected. These robots were buried in improperly-shielded coffins. Their programming leaked into the castles wiring through this old, abandoned modem allowing them to project themselves as holograms."
The Honking,Hermes, Of course! It was so obvious!
The Honking,Farnsworth," Yes, that sequence of words I said made perfect sense. We really should tell Bender there's nothing to be afraid of."
The Honking,Bender, [screaming] Nooo!
The Honking,Fry," Bender, wake up! [Bender mumbles as he starts to come around.] He's OK! Quick, does anyone have any liquor?"
The Honking,Leela," Bender, what happened?"
The Honking,Bender," Somebody tried to run me over. And not with a normal hover-car. It crept along the ground on round, rubber feet, like a wolf!"
The Honking,Fry," Poor Bender, you're seeing things. You've been drinking too much, or too little, I forget how it works with you. Anyway, you haven't drunk exactly the right amount."
The Honking,Amy, Maybe he has. Look at these tracks.
The Honking,Leela, I think Bender may be telling the truth.
The Honking,Zoidberg," Bender, you look awful. I prescribe make-up. Here. It just so happens I have my Mary Kay sample case!"
The Honking,Bender," Ah, I just need sleep. I had nightmares all night about cars running people over."
The Honking,Zoidberg," Many people dream of a fresh, new look. And Mary Kay can make those dreams come true."
The Honking,Leela," Look at this. They found those same rubbery tracks right here in New New York. [She drops a newspaper onto the table. The headline ""Hit And Run"" dominates the front page.] There was a hit-and-run by the robot porno theatre."
The Honking,Bender, Robot porno theatre? I was in that ... general area last night. Whoever ran me down out on the moors must've followed me back here.
The Honking,Hermes," Bender, mon, no one's trying to run you over. Stop being a big, hallucinating baby."
The Honking,Bender," Yeah? Could a big, hallucinating baby do this  [crying] I scared!"
The Honking,Vandal #1, I don't know which I like more  Smashing cars or smashing faces.
The Honking,Vandal #2," Well, lucky you don't gotta decide tonight. Now come on, we got church tomorrow. [The grey car quietly follows them. It rolls over a manhole cover and quickly parks.] Did you hear something?"
The Honking,Vandal #1," Ah, it was probably just a golden marmoset."
The Honking,Vandal #2, That don't sound like no golden marmoset I ever heard.
The Honking,Vandal #1, Made it!
The Honking,Vandal #2," So anyway, what're you wearing tomorrow?"
The Honking,Bender, Where--? What the--? [He tastes it.] Transmission fluid? Where have I been? What happened?
The Honking,Sal," Gets outta here, yous lousy bum!"
The Honking,Bender," Please, I'm scared."
The Honking,Sal," We're all scared, it's the human condition. Why do you thinks I put on this tough-guy facade? Now beat it!"
The Honking,Bender," I passed out around midnight, which is much earlier that usual, and when I woke up I found these in my chest cabinet."
The Honking,Fry," Aw, relax, buddy. You were probably just shooting some big, fuzzy craps."
The Honking,Bender," No, I think I may have hurt someone. Oh, Lord! I'm on the verge of a nervous meltdown."
The Honking,Fry," Jeez, Bender, you're scaring me. You're going wacko!"
The Honking,Bender," You're right, I need professional help. And damn the expense."
The Honking,Bender, Damn the expense!
The Honking,Gypsy," My friend, you have nothing to worry about. Except a nightmare-ish life of unremitting horror!"
The Honking,Bender, Phew!
The Honking,Gypsy," For, you see, you are a were-car."
The Honking,Bender, A were-car?
The Honking,Gypsy, The car that ran you down on the moors was also a were-car. It beamed a virus to you through its demonic headlights.
The Honking,Leela, That's crazy!
The Honking,Gypsy," Yes. So crazy that it must be true! Each midnight, when your clock resets to zero, your hardware reconfigures into a murderous, four-wheeled car."
The Honking,Bender, I can't keep running people over. I'm not famous enough to get away with it. Can't you help me?
The Honking,Gypsy, Yes. But you must be willing to pay a terrible price.
The Honking,Bender," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
The Honking,Gypsy, Follow me.
The Honking,Gypsy," According to this ancient read-me file, your only hope is to destroy the original were-car."
The Honking,Bender, I'm with you.
The Honking,Gypsy," In its death throes, the dread car will beam out the virus's uninstall program, thus ridding you of the curse."
The Honking,Bender, And otherwise I can never die?
The Honking,Gypsy, Who said that? Sure you can die. You want to die?
The Honking,Bender, No! I wanna live! There's still too many things I don't own!
The Honking,Gypsy," Then live on, forever cursed. Each night, your attacks will become more gruesome until, one dark night, you are doomed to kill your dearest friend."
The Honking,Fry, I wouldn't wanna be me right now.
The Honking,Gypsy," [pointing] Now go! Go! [She presses against the glass and topples forwards.] Uh, could one of you just-- Ah, forget it. I'll just sleep here."
The Honking,Leela, There. No rampaging for you tonight.
The Honking,Bender, Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?
The Honking,Leela," Just relax, Bender. Tomorrow we'll pry you down, have a nice breakfast and then go hunt down and slaughter that ancient evil."
The Honking,Fry," It'll be a rich, full day."
The Honking,Leela," Well, goodnight. I'm gonna go make my dinners for the next month and freeze them."
The Honking,Fry," [shouting] Bender, no!"
The Honking,Leela," [shouting] Fry, stay back!"
The Honking,Fry, [shouting] You jerk. I thought I was your best friend. What kind of two-timing kill-mobile are you?
The Honking,Fry," I can't believe this! Bender is supposed to murder his closest friend, which I thought was me. But he went straight for you. He didn't even try to second-degree murder me."
The Honking,Leela, Could you give me some help? I think Bender crushed my foot.
The Honking,Fry, Stop rubbing it in!
The Honking,Bender," Oh, God! Fry, I'm so glad to see you. I didn't hurt you, did I?"
The Honking,Fry," Not physically. But why don't you ask your new best friend, Leela?"
The Honking,Bender, I tried to run you over?
The Honking,Leela," It was very sweet of you, Bender."
The Honking,Bender," Fry, it doesn't mean anything. I have love enough for two."
The Honking,Fry," Words. Nothing but sweet, sweet words that turn into bitter, orange wax in my ears."
The Honking,Leela," Enough with the feelings, you two. If we're gonna cure Bender we've got to go back to the castle and hunt down the original were-car."
The Honking,Fry," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
The Honking,Leela," Cursed, got it."
The Honking,Bender, Whatever.
The Honking,Leela, The tracks lead here.
The Honking,Fry," Thanks, eagle eye."
The Honking,Leela," Now it's daylight, so he should be in robot form. But be careful  Many robots are stupid and violent."
The Honking,Bender," [sarcastic] I wish I was stupid and violent. Then we'd see what's what, I'd pound him till--"
The Honking,Yokelbot," Get ye to your houses, ye ignorant villagers."
The Honking,Leela," We are not ignorant villagers, we're sophisticated New New Yorkers. Whup his butt!"
The Honking,Yokelbot, Stop! What are ye doing?
The Honking,Bender," We're whaling on the original were-car, which is you, you jerk."
The Honking,Yokelbot, Ye think me be he?
The Honking,Bender, Sí.
The Honking,Yokelbot," Nee. I mean, ""no"". I was given the curse many a year ago while on a bird-watching trip to the Arctic..."
The Honking,Yokelbot," [voice-over] I was attacked by a vicious, motorised sled. The natives called it ""The Abominable Snowmobile""."
The Honking,Inuitbot," Yes, it's true. I ran over that bird-watching jerk and a hundred others. Even my best friend from aromatherapy school."
The Honking,Fry, I once had a best friend who liked to smell things with me.
The Honking,Inuitbot," Alas, I'm afraid I'm not the original were-car. I received the curse while taking a learning annex class from a famous robot actor."
The Honking,Inuitbot, [voice-over] You know him as Calculon.
The Honking,Calculon," [melodramatically] Oh, fate most cruel, would that my boundless acting skills would avail me a sword with which to slay this wretched curse."
The Honking,Bender, Let's kick him some more.
The Honking,Calculon," No, wait, let me explain. [melodramatically] It all began one fateful night a thousand years ago."
The Honking,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You're a thousand years old? Your bio says you're 27!"
The Honking,Calculon," Lies! I change my identity and upgrade my appearance every few decades to avoid suspicion. I was all of history's great acting robots  Acting Unit 0.8, Thespo-mat, David Duchovny!"
The Honking,Fry," Look, are you the original were-car or not?"
The Honking,Calculon," No, but you are nearing the end of your search. For, you see, I was attacked by the original were-car."
The Honking,Bender," Give us a name, MacButt!"
The Honking,Calculon," The year was 2019, and I was just a lowly robot arm..."
The Honking,Calculon," [voice-over] ...working in an automotive research lab. I was working on Project Satan ... [He puts a door onto the side of a red car.] ... a savage, intelligent military vehicle built from the most evil parts of the most evil cars in all the world. The steering wheel from Hitler's staff car, the left-turn signal from Charles Manson's VW, the windshield wipers from that car that played Knight Rider."
The Honking,Fry, Knight Rider wasn't evil.
The Honking,Calculon, His windshield wipers were. It didn't come up much in the show though. Anyway...
The Honking,Calculon," [melodramatically; voice-over] Only after bringing Project Satan to life did they discover they had made a horrible mistake. [A man turns the key in the ignition.] For, you see, it was pure evil."
The Honking,Leela, So what happened to Project Satan?
The Honking,Calculon," [voice-over] It's either in Paris, or much more likely..."
The Honking,Calculon, [voice-over] ...still in the abandoned automotive lab.
The Honking,Leela, You guys distract the were-car and I'll kill it by plugging its exhaust pipe with this silver potato.
The Honking,Bender," [whispering] Psst, there it is."
The Honking,Leela, It looks so unhappy. Excuse me? Are you Project Satan? [It growls feebly.] Don't be afraid. We know what you are.
The Honking,Project Satan, You do?
The Honking,Leela, Would you like us to ... put you out of your misery?
The Honking,Project Satan, Misery? What misery? I love killing people! Squishing them till their organs squirt out like chunky mustard.
The Honking,Bender," Look, everyone loves killing people, but I don't wanna hurt my friends."
The Honking,Leela," Oh, no! It's midnight."
The Honking,Bender," Hey, this is starting to feel pretty good!"
The Honking,Leela," Fry, distract him."
The Honking,Fry," [leaping around] Hey, Project Satan! Over here! I'm a blind pedestrian! 20 points!"
The Honking,Leela," Oh, no! There's no exhaust pipe!"
The Honking,Project Satan," That's right! Thanks to Ed Begley Jr.'s electric motor, the most evil propulsion system ever conceived! [Bender completes his transformation and Project Satan pulls up beside him.] Take whichever one you want."
The Honking,Bender," Oh, boy! I feel like a car in a candy store!"
The Honking,Fry," [gasping] Yes! He chose me! He's trying to kill me! Leela, I'm so happy! [Bender rams Fry's legs twice. Fry tumbles onto Bender's roof, through the sunroof and inside Bender. The seatbelt comes around him.] [talking] Oh, thanks, Bender. [The seatbelt chokes him.] [choking] Too tight! Too tight!"
The Honking,Leela, Whoa!
The Honking,Bender, Uh-oh.
The Honking,Leela," Bender, you're cured! But what happened to Fry?"
The Honking,Bender, [crying] I must've killed him. He's my best friend and I killed him. I never felt so empty inside.
The Honking,Fry," Bender, I'm alive! [He climbs out.] You didn't hurt me at all. But I know you wanted to, and that's what matters. [He opens a beer.] Here's to you."
The Honking,Bender," Hey, that's my last beer, you bastard. I'll kill you!"
The Honking,Fry," I'll kill you too, buddy. I'll kill you too!"
The Honking,,
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Giant Space Robot, this is Captain Fry of the USS Planet Express Ship. We come in peace."
The Cryonic Woman,Bender, Tough luck!
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Well, we destroyed the toy spaceship. Now what are we gonna do?"
The Cryonic Woman,Bender," [pointing] Hey, look! The keys to the real spaceship."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, Do you think we should?
The Cryonic Woman,Bender," [firmly] Yes, I do."
The Cryonic Woman,Farnsworth," Leela, have you seen the keys to the spaceship?"
The Cryonic Woman,Leela, [patting her pockets] I must've left them onboard.
The Cryonic Woman,Farnsworth," Eh, wha? I mean, what?"
The Cryonic Woman,Leela, Relax. The ship's not going anywhere. I anchored it with the unbreakable diamond tether.
The Cryonic Woman,Amy," Oh, no!"
The Cryonic Woman,Hermes, Sweet ghost of Babylon.
The Cryonic Woman,Zoidberg, This isn't good for Zoidberg!
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Woo, yeah!"
The Cryonic Woman,Bender, Woo-hoo!
The Cryonic Woman,Bender," Hey, Fry, I'm steering with my ass!"
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, That's the best thing I ever saw!
The Cryonic Woman,Italian #1, You stink!
The Cryonic Woman,Italian #1," Alright, yeah!"
The Cryonic Woman,Italian #2, We like you a lot!
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, That was great!
The Cryonic Woman,Bender, And no one suspects a thing! [He laughs and gasps when he sees the rest of the staff standing angrily at the bottom of the steps.] Whoa! [A wall collapses.] And that's how we learned our lesson!
The Cryonic Woman,Farnsworth, You've gone too far this time -- all three of you!
The Cryonic Woman,Leela, What did I do?
The Cryonic Woman,Farnsworth," You left the keys in the ignition. I mean, look at those two. Wasn't it obvious what would happen?"
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Yeah, Leela."
The Cryonic Woman,Bender, We're all very disappointed in you.
The Cryonic Woman,Farnsworth," I should fire you three right now, but I'm just not that cold-hearted."
The Cryonic Woman,Hermes, You're all fired.
The Cryonic Woman,Zoidberg," [waving] Goodbye, friends. I'll miss you. [They round a corner and hear Zoidberg talking to the others through a hole in the wall.] Good riddance to them. Now Zoidberg is the popular one!"
The Cryonic Woman,Farnsworth," Yes, yes! Let's all talk to Zoidberg."
The Cryonic Woman,Amy," Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, I've been thinking, do you think we could go out?"
The Cryonic Woman,Farnsworth," So, Zoidberg, what's new?"
The Cryonic Woman,Hermes," Tell me, Zoidberg  Is it carapace or carapass?"
The Cryonic Woman,Zoidberg," Oh, you know!"
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," What are we supposed to do for money? [He opens his wallet.] All I've got is my frequent taffy eater's card, my first moustache ... [He holds it up in a bag.] ... and this picture of me and my old girlfriend, Michelle, and that ski instructor she was just friends with."
The Cryonic Woman,Bender," Pardon me, brother. Care to donate to the Anti-Mugging-You Fund? [Leela slaps his wrist.] Ow!"
The Cryonic Woman,Leela," We don't need to beg, Bender. For God's sake, we're not veterans!"
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Well, what do you suggest? A daring daylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant-back? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!"
The Cryonic Woman,Leela," No, we can get jobs."
The Cryonic Woman,Bender, But we just had jobs!
The Cryonic Woman,Leela," Fortunately, I still have our old career chips."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, Our what?
The Cryonic Woman,Leela, Career chips. [She holds one up.] You remember? They assign you the job you're best at. [Fry stares blankly.] I tried to give you one and you ran away. [No response.] It's how we met!
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, And then what happened?
The Cryonic Woman,Leela, Just give me your hand.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, Ow!
The Cryonic Woman,Leela, Baby! [She clips herself.] Ow!
The Cryonic Woman,Leela, I'd like to reapply for my old job  Counselling defrostees and assigning them careers.
The Cryonic Woman,Ipgee," Oh, I was hoping you would come back! I even saved your poster of a chimp expressing your distaste for Mondays."
The Cryonic Woman,Leela," Monday Monkey lives for the weekend, sir."
The Cryonic Woman,Ipgee," Just put your hand under the scanner so I can verify your career chip. [He takes something out of another drawer and scans Leela's hand. It beeps and he looks at his computer screen.] Calcutta, we have a problem."
The Cryonic Woman,Leela, Delivery boy? I must have mixed up the chips. It's a simple mi--
The Cryonic Woman,Ipgee," Oh, here's a cryogenic counsellor! Do you like Mondays?"
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, They're OK.
The Cryonic Woman,Ipgee, Then we'll have to redecorate your office. How do you feel about it helping to be crazy to work here but not being necessary?
The Cryonic Woman,Bender," Hey, let's see what it says about me."
The Cryonic Woman,Ipgee," Welcome aboard, sir."
The Cryonic Woman,Terry," Remember, when the tube opens, say ... [melodramatically] ... ""Welcome to the world of tomorrow!"""
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Hey, I was frozen. I think I know what people wanna hear when they first wake up. [The freezer pings and opens. A man walks out, clutching his head.] Bathroom's that way."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," So, while you're on the Probulator, tell me what brings you to the future."
The Cryonic Woman,Man," Oh, well, I wanted to meet Shakespeare and I figured that time was cyclical."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Nope. Straight line. [His control panel pings.] Ah, the Probulator's done."
The Cryonic Woman,Man, That wasn't so bad.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Oh, wait, it hasn't started yet. [The machines start making noises and the man screams.] OK, it's about to start."
The Cryonic Woman,Bender," Welcome to the future, human slave. [The man trembles and Bender laughs.] Ah, relax, chum. I'm not really a giant fly! [He takes the cape and head off.] I'm a horrible robot! [The man backs into the freezer and Bender walks towards him, turning his head and outstretching his arms.] Kill all humans!"
The Cryonic Woman,Terry, Dear God! He's having a heart attack!
The Cryonic Woman,Bender," Ah, they'll probably find a cure for that in the future."
The Cryonic Woman,Terry, We have a cure for it now!
The Cryonic Woman,Bender," Oh, good. Then you won't mind if I use this."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, Nothing like a power nap.
The Cryonic Woman,Old Man," Oh, flies! Flies and gorillas!"
The Cryonic Woman,Bender," Stay beautiful, doll-face! [The door closes.] That Probulator sure knows how to please a man. So, what's for lunch?"
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, I ordered a pizza.
The Cryonic Woman,Leela," Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener. [Fry and Bender laugh.] Yeah, very funny. Now cough up the $12.95."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Sorry, but if it's not here in half an hour, it's free."
The Cryonic Woman,Leela, It's only been 23 minutes.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," [checking his watch] Well, uh, I've got 33 minutes."
The Cryonic Woman,Chef," It's only been a-23 minutes, you dumb a-cannoli. You got a problem, we can take it outside."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," OK, I'll fight the box. I think I can take him."
The Cryonic Woman,Leela," Fry, just pay me. I still owe 30 bucks on this uniform."
The Cryonic Woman,Chef," 35, you stupid meatball."
The Cryonic Woman,Bender, Who should be unfreeze next?
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," No. [They pass Weird Al Yankovic.] No! [They move onto the next one.] Oh, my God! It's Pauly Shore!"
The Cryonic Woman,Bender, Alright!
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Mr. Shore, I loved you in Bio-Dome. You sure caused some trouble in that bubble!"
The Cryonic Woman,Shore," Rest assured, if it rhymes, I can cause trouble in it."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Hey, now that you're in the future, you can go live in an actual bio-dome!"
The Cryonic Woman,Shore," An unattractive prospect. While researching for the role, I ran computer simulations demonstrating, incontrovertibly, that the whole bio-enclosure concept is fundamentally flawed. Be it expressed via dome, sphere, cube or even a stately tetrahedron, buddy!"
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Oh. [He coughs.] So, how did you wind up getting frozen?"
The Cryonic Woman,Shore," Well, while filming Encino Man my intellectual curiosity re  cryogenics was peaked, and I resolved to freeze the weasel."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, The weasel?
The Cryonic Woman,Shore," Hey, listen, skippy. I was supposed to be unfrozen in Hollywood for the thousandth anniversary screening of Jury Duty II. How come I'm not there?"
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, I woke you up early so we could hang out and do stuff.
The Cryonic Woman,Shore, Like what?
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, I love this job.
The Cryonic Woman,Bender, Me too.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, Showtime! [hoarse] I'll pretend to be dying of space plague.
The Cryonic Woman,Bender, Boo?
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, Michelle!
The Cryonic Woman,Bender," Oh, my God!"
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle, Fry? Is it really you?
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, I don't know. Is it really you?
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle, What do you mean you don't know? Are you you or not?
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, Who wants to know?
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle," Oh, Fry, it is you!"
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," I don't get it, Michelle. The last time I saw you, you were doing great. You had just dumped me and you were well on your way to getting you life back on track. Why'd you freeze yourself?"
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle," Oh, Fry. After you left, things took a turn for the worse. I got married."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, I'm sorry.
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle, [voice-over] His name was Charles. He attended a law school so prestigious the basketball team was coached by Ruth Bader Ginsburg. [The flashback changes to Michelle waving Charles off outside one of his classes. The basketball team runs by and Ruth Bader Ginsburg blows a whistle. Then it changes to Michelle being bitten by a pack of barking dogs.] I put him through law school by working as a dog walker for antisocial dogs.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, Sorry.
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle," [voice-over] But soon after Charles graduated, our marriage ran into difficulties."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Uh, sorry."
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle," [voice-over] Desperately depressed, I turned to the one thing that could lessen my pain  A carnival. Unfortunately, a corn dog bone got lodged in the control panel of the Spizzler, and I had to ride it for eight hours."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, [voice-over] Sorry.
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle, [voice-over] But it did give me a chance to think...
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, I'm sorry.
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle, And I remembered the last time I was truly happy; when I was with you.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, Aww. So you froze yourself to come look for me?
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle," No, I did it to get a fresh start. I didn't know what had happened to you -- no one did. The police were going to conduct a search but your parents felt it was a waste of taxpayer money."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," That's the same reason they kept me out of school. So, no one even cared that I was gone?"
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle, Not really. Except for one person.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, Who was it?
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle, Everything is so different.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, Not everything. There's still a roach problem.
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle, Ew!
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle, Eurgh.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Nowadays, people aren't interested in art that's not tattooed on fat guys."
The Cryonic Woman,Sal, I'm on loan from the Louvre.
The Cryonic Woman,Leela," Please, Professor. Give us our jobs back. We deserve another chance."
The Cryonic Woman,Bender," Yeah, and if you won't give me another chance, perhaps you'd give one to ... [He puts his gorilla mask on.] ... Og, gorilla emperor of Earth!"
The Cryonic Woman,Farnsworth," I'm sorry, Og, but I've got a new crew."
The Cryonic Woman,Farnsworth," So, how was delivery to Fantasy Planet, where everyone's fantasies come to life?"
The Cryonic Woman,Amy, Great!
The Cryonic Woman,Hermes, Organised!
The Cryonic Woman,Zoidberg," For one beautiful night, I knew what it was to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honoured."
The Cryonic Woman,Farnsworth," You see, Og? Everything's running smoothly, yes. And with Fry fired, I can finally leave my jigsaw puzzles out without him eating the pieces."
The Cryonic Woman,Leela, Forget about Fry. You can hire us back and he'd never have to know.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Hey, guys."
The Cryonic Woman,Leela," Oh, uh, hey, Fry!"
The Cryonic Woman,Bender," So, as Leela was saying, Fry can go shove a big, old-- Ow!"
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," I'm glad you're all here. I wanted to introduce you to my on-again-off-again girlfriend of the past thousand years, Michelle. [Everyone claps.] Michelle, this is Leela. [Michelle screams.] This is Bender. [Michelle screams.] The Professor. [Farnsworth waves. Michelle looks at Fry and he nods. She screams.] Hermes and Amy."
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle, Nice to meet you.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, And this is Dr. Zoidberg.
The Cryonic Woman,Hermes," Dating you ex, Fry? Have you lost all self-respect?"
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, All what?
The Cryonic Woman,Farnsworth," This can only end badly, Fry. Kids, a house--"
The Cryonic Woman,Bender, A home invasion by a former roommate.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," But things are different this time. Before, she was demanding and possessive. But now she wants me to do stuff and stay with her all the time."
The Cryonic Woman,Zoidberg," There you go, dearies."
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle," It's a relief to meet you, Amy. I'm just having a hard time adjusting to all the strange stuff here in the future."
The Cryonic Woman,Amy, I'm from Mars.
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle, [trembling] I feel so out of place here. I don't understand why Fry fits in so well.
The Cryonic Woman,Leela, [sitting down] Probably because he didn't fit in back in your time.
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle, That's true. But I used to fit in really well.
The Cryonic Woman,Zoidberg," Then good luck, sister."
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle," Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but your friends are a bunch of freaks."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Yeah, they're great, huh?"
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle," I just don't belong here. I don't know anyone, I can't find a vanishing cream that doesn't make me actually vanish. I don't even have a job."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Oh, right. I was supposed to assign you a job. Let me just get your career chip installed. [He picks up the implant gun.] Hold out your palm. [Michelle whimpers.] What are you scared of? It's just like getting your hand pierced."
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle," This world is horrible. Let's start over, Fry. We'll go someplace where all we have is each other."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Ooh, romantic. I'll tell Bender to meet us there."
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle," It's not a ""there"". It's a ""then"". [She turns a freezer dial to 1000 years.] The future."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Whoa, whoa, girl. I thought you were talking about one of those motels where the bed is shaped like stuff."
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle, I love you. Don't you love me?
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Well, sure. To the extent a man can love a woman. But this seems like a big step."
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle," Fry, why must you analyse everything with your relentless logic? Nothing matters but our love."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, You're right. Let's do this now and let's never regret it.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Michelle, I don't regret this. But I both rue and lament it."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, The year 4000 is severely disappointing. I miss the year 3000 when life was simple and brains flew through space and everyone ate lasers.
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle, It's not that bad. Fate brought us together and now fate brought us here.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," No, you brought us here."
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle," Whine some more, Fry, I really find that attractive in a man. Now come on, build us a shelter."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Alright, fine. Everything else sucks. At least we can have a nice place to live."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, There!
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle, You expect me to live in a tiny little hole?
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," It'd be deeper, but I'm standing on a gopher."
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle," Oh, look! Some little kids."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, They'll save us. [The kids point guns at them.] We're saved!
The Cryonic Woman,Butch," I'm Butch, leader of this place. I took your hole and you can't do nothing about it."
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle, OK.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Mighty sir, we have nowhere to go. Could we please join your society?"
The Cryonic Woman,Butch," Well, alright. But no interfering with our grand works."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," I tell you, that Butch runs a pretty good civilisation. I think I'll enjoy serving under him."
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle," You know your problem, Fry? You're not ambitious. You should be chief."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," What do I need, ulcers?"
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle, But I want power. I'm tired of the chief's girlfriend lording it over me with her fancy coyote hide.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Alright, alright. If it'll make you happy, I'll overthrow society."
The Cryonic Woman,Butch, On what grounds do you challenge my authority?
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Well, I'm older than you. I can beat you up."
The Cryonic Woman,Kid #1," Yeah, I'll bet he could."
The Cryonic Woman,Butch's Girlfriend, He's got arm hair.
The Cryonic Woman,Butch," Alright, grandpa. There's only one way to settle this  Death rolling!"
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, What's death rolling?
The Cryonic Woman,Orowheat, It's like skateboarding.
The Cryonic Woman,Ice-V," Except half the time, someone dies."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Oh, so it's a little safer than skateboarding."
The Cryonic Woman,Butch, Last one holding the bandana's the new leader.
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle," My mother always said you were a loser, Fry. Now get out there and prove her wrong."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, [sadly] Beth said that?
The Cryonic Woman,Butch's Girlfriend," Achat, shtayim, shalosh!"
The Cryonic Woman,Butch, It's cool. Back off! [He looks at his bleeding knee.] [crying] My knee. I scraped it!
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, Aww. Poor little guy. Let me just take a look at-- Aha! [He snatches the bandana and dances around.] I won! I'm the new chief! I'm the tallest and I weigh the most!
The Cryonic Woman,Butch," Hand it over, you giant idiot."
The Cryonic Woman,Butch's Girlfriend," Hey, Butch, your mom's here."
The Cryonic Woman,Butch," Aw, man."
The Cryonic Woman,Butch's Mom," Come on, kids. You're late for Hebrew school."
The Cryonic Woman,Orowheat, I don't wanna go.
The Cryonic Woman,Butch's Girlfriend, Every Monday and Wednesday's the same thing.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," I find this post-apocalyptic wasteland very confusing. Seriously, I'm weirded out."
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle, That's because you're a loser. You were a loser in the year 2000 and you're a loser in the year 4000.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Yeah, but in the year 3000, I had it all. Several friends, a low-paying job, a bed in a robot's closet. I envied no man. But you wrecked everything."
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle," Quit standing up for yourself, Fry. When we get back to the hole we are going to have a long, boring talk about our relationship!"
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Oh, yeah? Well, listen to this  [whispering] I'm leaving you."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, There must be people somewhere.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," Yes! Footprints! And hand prints? [The mist clears some more and he sees the foot and hand prints are signed by Clark Gable. Some more signatures appear including those of Florp, Dame Calista Flockhart, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Slurms MacKenzie, Calculon and James Mason.] But? What's happening?"
The Cryonic Woman,Leela," Fry, thank God we found you."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, Leela? What are you guys doing here in the year 4000?
The Cryonic Woman,Leela, It's not the year 4000.
The Cryonic Woman,Bender," You were only frozen for two days. Uh, by the way, I broke your bed."
The Cryonic Woman,Farnsworth, You were in Pauly Shore's tube and they were delivering it to his movie screening.
The Cryonic Woman,Leela," But, when they noticed you weren't him, they chucked you in a ditch."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, So you're saying these aren't the decaying ruins of New York in the year 4000?
The Cryonic Woman,Farnsworth, You wish! You're in Los Angeles!
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, But there was this gang of 10-year-olds with guns.
The Cryonic Woman,Leela," Exactly, you're in L.A."
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, But everyone is driving around in cars shooting at each other.
The Cryonic Woman,Bender, That's L.A. for you.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry, But the air is green and there's no sign of civilisation whatsoever.
The Cryonic Woman,Bender, He just won't stop with the social commentary.
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," And the people are all phoneys. No one reads. Everything has cilantro on it-- [A limo pulls up and the window comes down. Inside, Michelle and Pauly Shore drink champagne.] Michelle, baby!"
The Cryonic Woman,Michelle," It's not working out, Fry."
The Cryonic Woman,Shore," [shouting] Tis better to have loved and lost, n'est ce-pas?"
The Cryonic Woman,Fry," That's it. I've had it with women. From now on, I'm concentrating on my career. Can I have my old job back?"
The Cryonic Woman,Farnsworth," Why, I've forgotten why I even fired you."
The Cryonic Woman,Bender," 'Cause he destroyed your business, your home and all your possessions."
The Cryonic Woman,Farnsworth," Oh, that's right. Get lost!"
The Cryonic Woman,,
Amazon Women in the Mood,Hermes," People, we got a problem  Little Nibbler's been coughing up hairballs."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela," Well, so has Fry. What's the big deal?"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry, He's got me beat!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Hermes," Now we all love Nibbler, so it's only fair that we all pitch in and clean it up together. Still, I propose we make Zoidberg do it. All in favour?"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, Yeah!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender," Alright, yup."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Hermes, All opposed? [No one raises their hand.] All abstaining?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, Dr. Zoidberg? Are you OK?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry, He's dead.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender, What?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy," Oh, no!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Farnsworth," He always seemed so full of life; laughing, singing, begging for scraps. And now this."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zoidberg, Why with all the crying? [He looks across the room.] So that's where I left my shell.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, I didn't know you could take this thing off.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zoidberg," It was starting to get a little cramped in there so I molted, why not? Ah, the fresh air feels good!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Farnsworth, Stop doing that!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zoidberg, So long. I'm off to toss this old shell in the dumpster and maybe pick up those potato chips Amy didn't finish yesterday.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy, Those were toenail clippings.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zoidberg, A feast is a feast.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy," Hey, that's my cellphone!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy, Hello? [The sound of heavy breathing and gasping comes from the other end.] Hello? Who is this? [The breathing and gasping continues.] Hello? Hello?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, What's wrong? Did you swallow your phone again?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy, Some guy's been calling and hanging up 10 times a day for a year.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, Men who call too much are the worst ... I bet.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy, I just wish a decent guy would call me instead of this spleeze-ball who has me too terrified to even answer the phone. [The phone rings again and she picks it up without hesitation.] Hello?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy, [on phone] Hello? Is anyone there?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif," I love you. [He sighs and looks at his wall. It is covered with pictures of Amy and a newspaper clipping of the Titanic disaster. Underneath the headline ""Titanic Survivors"" is a photo of him carrying Amy towards the escape pod. He picks up the phone again and tries to dial but puts the receiver down and huddles over himself on his bed.] Why must I be such a coward?"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," Kif, I'm headed to the men's room and I'll be needing an attendant, so-- Oh, I'm sorry. You're crying like a woman. [Kif stops crying.] It's alright. I've always thought myself as a father figure to some of my more pathetic men. Kif, old friend, let's rap."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif," Well, I'm in love with this girl--"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," [laughing] Oh, that's rich! [talking] Go on."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif, I met her a year ago...
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif, [voice-over] ...when we were escaping from that cruise ship you piloted directly into a black hole.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp, [voice-over; proud] Yes! It was in all the papers.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy, Call me.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," Uh-huh, uh-huh. Mm-hmm, uh-huh."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif," I've finished talking, sir."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp, Belay that remark! [He looks at the newspaper clipping.] Your Amy knows my Leela? I have formed an idea!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," I'm calling to negotiate a double date. You and me, Kif and Amy."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, [on screen] Forget it.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp, [on screen] Then let the negotiations begin. I propose we go out on 10 dates.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, How about zero?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp, [on screen] Nine.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, Zero.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp, Seven.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, Zero.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp, [on screen] Eight?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy," [whispering] Please, Leela? Kif's like the sweetest guy who's ever liked me."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," [on screen] Five, and that's my final offer ... four."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, One.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp, [on screen] Two.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, One half.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp, I'll take it.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp, [on screen] We'll meet you tonight for part of dinner and the first half of a movie.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif," Um, sir? I don't go out on many dates and, um, what if I can't think of anything to say?"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp, Here's my personal book of pickup lines. [He hands Kif a small black book.] Say as many of them as you can as fast as you can. Don't stop for any reason.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif, Maybe I'll just give her these flowers.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," Wrong, wrong, wrong! And what's that? Candy? Candy's for dorks! Give me that. [He takes the box and walks away, eating the candy.] Mmm!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," Hello, beautiful. I got these for you."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, Thanks.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," Well, well. This looks to be one disturbingly erotic date."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, Half-date.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," Waiter, bring us a bottle of wine."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, Half-bottle.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp, And some oysters on the half-shell.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, Quarter-shell.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif," Oh, and I'd like--"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," Kif's not hungry. [quietly] Kif, this place is expensive. [talking] I'd like two steaks and the ladies will have some very sensual salads -- with low-cal sensual dressing."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Morbo," [singing] Oh, won't you take me to funkytown,"
Amazon Women in the Mood,"Oh, won't you take me to funkytown.",
Amazon Women in the Mood,[The song ends and the audience applauds.],
Amazon Women in the Mood,(talking) Thank you.,
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy," Kif, you're so quiet. You haven't said a word all night."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif," Well, um, um ... hello."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy, 'Cause I was really hoping we could talk and stuff.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif," Amy, [reading] if I said you had a beautiful body would you take your pants off and dance around a little?"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy, What?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, Lieutenant Kroker!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif, [reading] I find the most erotic part of the woman is the boobies
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy, Kif!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif," Oh, my!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, This half-date is entirely over. Amy? Conference!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif," Is there nothing we can do, sir?"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," There's only one sure-fire way back into a woman's heart and parts beyond. I speak, of course, of karaoke."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif, [determined] My years in the DOOP Boys' Chorus will not have been in vain!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela," Alright, enough lipstick. Let's storm out."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif," [singing] Once upon a time I was falling in love,"
Amazon Women in the Mood,But now I'm only falling apart...,
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy," Oh, that's so emotional!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif," [singing] There's nothing I can do,"
Amazon Women in the Mood,A total eclipse of the heart--,
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," Amateur hour's over. [He sits down.] Let me show you why they call me ""The Velour Fog""! Hit it!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,[The jukebox changes to some different music. Zapp smokes a cigarette and starts singing The Kinks' Lola.],
Amazon Women in the Mood,"(spoken-word) I met her in a club down in old Soho,",
Amazon Women in the Mood,"Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca-Cola,",
Amazon Women in the Mood,C-O-L-A ... Cola.,
Amazon Women in the Mood,Man," Aw, give us a break!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Woman, Get off!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Chef, He sickens me!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," [spoken-word] She walked up to me and she asked me to dance,"
Amazon Women in the Mood,"I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said,",
Amazon Women in the Mood,(singing) Leela!,
Amazon Women in the Mood,"L-E-E-L-A, Leela!",
Amazon Women in the Mood,Lee-Lee-Lee-Lee-Leela!,
Amazon Women in the Mood,Ba-ba-ba-dum-ba-dum-bum!,
Amazon Women in the Mood,[People get out of their seats and run around screaming.],
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela!,
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, We're going home. Call us a space taxi.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," No need. There's not a restaurant built I can't fly. Where to, ladies?"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif," Please, sir. Let's just divide up the check and--"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp, Let's see what this eatery can do.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," Ah, she's built like a steakhouse, but she handles like a bistro. [The restaurant shakes.] She's out of control!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," [from inside] You win again, gravity!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zoidberg," Look what arrived  My new shell catalogue. So let's try some on, already! [He puts the catalogue on the coffee table and it opens up like a laptop. It emits a holographic stereotypical Mexican shell onto his body.] Ah! Muy macho! Hey, gringos, here comes El Zoido to ruin your drinking water!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm Mexican and I find that offensive."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zoidberg, You Latins are so hot-blooded! [He changes the shell and the new one looks like the outfit worn by the cop from The Village People.] This one's like a summer guy!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Hermes," Look, you fat fish, the Planet Express health plan only covers one kind of replacement shell."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry, I can't believe Leela and Amy aren't back yet from their half-date. I'm gonna call the restaurant.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Operator, [on phone] The number you have dialled has crashed into a planet. Please make a note of it.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry, We gotta go rescue them!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender," Eh, I don't know."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry, Bender! Think of the señoritas!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender, Vámonos!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif," So, Amy, um, well--"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy, It's always a line with you!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, What planet is this anyway?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp, [mumbling] I 'unno. [talking] This whole sector is uncharted.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif," It is not uncharted, you lost the chart!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," Well, nothing to do now but repopulate the human race. [He turns to Leela.] Just me and you! [He leans over to Amy.] [whispering] And maybe you."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy, What is it?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kug," Me hear people, but me not see people."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Thog, No big deal. Everybody make mistake.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," Well, hello! I usually don't say this but you are the most beautiful trio of gigantic ladies I've ever laid eyes on. [The Amazonians growl. Zapp picks up his book.] [reading] I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boo--"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry," Oh, no! Any sign of Leela or Amy?"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender, No. But what do you make of this?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry, I don't know. But it might have something to do with this.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender," Oh, your God!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kug, Move! Go!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry," Alright, here's the plan--"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender, What kind of moronic plan is that? [They look up. The grass they were hidden in is part of a grass skirt that an Amazonian is wearing.] Wow!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Thog, Women go free. Men stay in chains.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Ornik, We take them to our leader. She know what do.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry, Pft. A female leader?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela," Fry, shut up."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry," [saluting] Yes, Captain!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Thog, This capital city planet Amazonia.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, Where are all the men in your society?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Ornik, Men die out many year ago.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender," With all these women around they were probably nagged to death. Are you with me, fellas?"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Thog," Here stadium, where our women basketball teams play."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kug," We no can dunk, but good fundamentals."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Ornik, That more fun to watch.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," [laughing] Oh, God, you're killing me! [He is beaten around the head.] Ow! God, you're killing me!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Thog, This our comedy club. Humour here funny in different way.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Ornik, It not reinforce stereotypes.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kug," Comedy come from character, real situations. Not abstract craziness."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender," Translation  Boring! [He, Zapp and Fry burst into laughter.] [laughing] That's a good one! [He literally gets his head bashed in.] Ow!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy, This women-only planet is sounding better and better.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, I'm already looking for apartments.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Thog," Here live vengeful, all-knowing leader. She decide men's fate."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry, Is she hot?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Thog, That not important. She all-knowing.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry," In other words, ""No"". [Thog kicks him in the face and he falls over.] Ow!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Thog, [chanting] All hail Femputer.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kug, and  [chanting] All hail Femputer.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy, You all obey a big computer?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kug, Yes. It appear mysteriously just about time men die out.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, So why did you make it your leader?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Ornik, It seemed like different kind of politician.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kug, Not beltway insider.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Thog," Femputer, we bring offering of bath beads and scented soaps."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Femputer, Your gift pleases Femputer. Femputer demands to know why there are men on her planet.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry," It was an accident, ma'am."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Femputer, That does not fempute. Femputer will return after deciding your punishment.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry," Leela, I'm through making fun of women. Now I want them to help me."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy, Should we do something?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, There's no hurry.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp, Yes! A little tighter. [She pulls it tighter.] Tighter. Perhaps a hard spanking is in order? [She punches him in the ass and he groans.] Too hard!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kug, Men strange. You have them on your planet?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, [ashamed] I'm afraid so.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kug," What they for? [Amy whispers something in her ear.] Oh, you mean ""snu-snu""."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Thog, We hear tell men used for snu-snu. But all we have go on are ancient legend and subscription to Cosmo.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," Just FYI, I could be used for snu-snu."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Thog, Silence. You want die like last men visit Amazonia?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry, What'd they die of?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kug, Crushed pelvises.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry, Yes!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," Oh, thank you, Lord in heaven!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Femputer," After lengthy femputations, I, Femputer, have decided the fate of the men. Femputer sentences them to death. [The prisoners, Amy and Leela gasp.] By snu-snu!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry, [cheering] Yay!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," [cheering] Yeah! [Kif whimpers and Zapp turns around to him.] [talking] What are you, gay?"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Femputer, Death to the men. Death by snu-snu.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry, Although the snu-snu part's gonna be pretty good.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," Baby, it'll blow your mind."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela," Femputer, be reasonable. Sure men are annoying and they wreck up whatever planet they're in charge of, but most of these men are sorta my friends. They don't deserve to die."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Femputer, Hmm. Perhaps men are not as evil as Femputer thinks.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Thog, But they make fun women's basketball.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Femputer, What? Did you explain how the women's good fundamentals make up for their inability to dunk?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Ornik, Yes. They still laugh.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Femputer, The men must die.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender," Too true, Femputer. You're so wise. Kill 'em all, I say. Good riddance! Did I mention I'm not a man? I'm a manbot. It's an understandable mistake. You can let me down now, thanks."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kug, He big jerk like man.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender, I sure am. But check the crotch. [He bangs it.] Nothing.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Femputer," Very well, release him. As for the others, take them to the snu-snu chambers."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender," [crying] I'll miss you, meatbag."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela," Me too, meatbag."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry," Goodbye, friends. I never thought I would die like this. But I'd always really hoped."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Femputer," [on loudspeaker] The Amazonians will be divided into three groups. The one called ""Zapp"" will be snu-snu'd by the large women. He that is designated ""Fry"" will be snu-snu'd by the petite women. And Kif, as the most attractive male, will be snu-snu'd by the most beautiful women of Amazonia. Then the large women. Then the petite women. Then the large women again. [Kif gasps.] Initiate snu-snu!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amazonians," [chanting] Snu-snu, snu-snu, snu-snu!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif," Amy, before I die, I have to tell you  I didn't mean to say those awful things on our date. They were all Zapp's idea."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy, Really? Honest and true?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif, Yes. And-And that person calling and hanging up was me. I was just too nervous to say hello because I love you.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy," Oh, Kif!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Thog, It Thog's first time. [She picks him up by his legs.] Be gentle!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela," We've got to do something. Bender, maybe you can interface with the Femputer and reprogram it to let them go."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender," Maybe you can interface with my ass. By biting it! [Amy grabs his arm and curses in Chinese.] Alright, I'll go!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry, [from inside] Ooh! Yeah!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp," [from inside] Oh, baby!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Guard #1, How Tonk look?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Guard #2, Tonk look good. Me fat.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Guard #1," No, you look good. Tonk fat."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Femputer, Intruder! Stay away from the mighty Femputer! Guards!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender, Time to override the CPU and reprogram this Femputer.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Femputer," Hey, whoa, whoa! Stop it! Stop it! Hey, cut that out!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fembot, Cease hitting Femputer!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender," You're no Femputer, you're a Fembot!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fembot, [ashamed] It's true. I disguised myself as a Femputer so I could rule the Amazonians.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender, But why?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fembot, Why? Why? I came here from a faraway planet. A planet ruled by a chauvinistic Manputer that was really a Manbot. Have you any idea how it feels to be a Fembot living in a Manbot's Manputer's world?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender, What?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fembot," And now, my meddling Manbot, there's the question of what to do with you!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp, [gasping] We need rest. The spirit is willing but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Ornik, It time snu-snu!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry, Can't we just cuddle? [She scoops him up.] [screaming] Nooo!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela," We can't wait for Bender. It's time for a woman's touch. [She kicks and punches the Amazonians.] Yah! Hi-yah! Yah, yah, yah!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy," [disguised, deeper voice] Me next snu-snu. Out me way."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Thog, Where go beautiful man? [Kif clings to ceiling and whimpers. Thog looks up and sees him.] Me want snu-snu!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy, Kif! Jump!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif, My hero!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Thog, [shouting] Me not get snu-snu! Get him!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Thog, Mighty Femputer. Small girl steal green kissy man. We kill her now?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fembot, [from inside] Come back later. Leave me alone.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender," [from inside] Yeah, get lost! [They giggle. Inside, the Fembot and Bender sit on her bed kissing. Bender holds the microphone and makes spooky noises.] [spookily] Ooh! I'm a scary Femputer. Release the prisoners! [Outside, the Amazonians look confused.] [from inside] And bring gold. Lots of gold."
Amazon Women in the Mood,Thog, Gold? Why Femputer want gold?
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fembot, [from inside] You heard the man.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender, [from inside] C'mon! Gimme some of that!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zoidberg," And that's how I got my new shell. It looks just like the shell I threw out yesterday and I found it in the same dumpster, but this one had a live raccoon inside. [He slurps.] Pretty good story, eh, Hermes?"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Hermes," Stick to someone else, you windy barnacle!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Leela, It's funny how the battle of the sexes was only resolved when a Manbot and a Fembot realised they loved each other.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Bender," Yeah. By the way, if she calls, I'm not here. All I know is this gold says that was the best mission ever!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Amy, It sure was.
Amazon Women in the Mood,Fry," Oh, yeah!"
Amazon Women in the Mood,Zapp, I had snu-snu!
Amazon Women in the Mood,Kif," So, um, Amy, w-what do you wanna do now?"
Amazon Women in the Mood,,
Parasites Lost,Man #1," [on radio] Breaker-breaker, this here's the Duck. Uh, you wanna back off them hogs?"
Parasites Lost,Man #1," [on radio] Ten-four, five miles or so."
Parasites Lost,Man #2," [on radio] Ten, roger!"
Parasites Lost,Leela," Hmm, I'd better check the fluid levels. [She pulls the dipstick out of the ship and looks at it.] [shouting] We're OK on Coke syrup."
Parasites Lost,Bender," Oh, man! Come on! [Leela pushes the dipstick back in. Bender suddenly explodes and his head flies past.] Comin' through!"
Parasites Lost,Bender, What's that black cracker?
Parasites Lost,Fry, A tomato.
Parasites Lost,Leela, You're not gonna eat a sandwich from a truck stop men's room are you?
Parasites Lost,Fry," Eh, what's the worst thing that could happen? [He takes a bite out of the sandwich.] Ugh! It's like a party in my mouth and everyone's throwing up!"
Parasites Lost,Trucker, Lookie there! It's one of them things like on our mud flaps!
Parasites Lost,Hoschel, Yosemite Sam?
Parasites Lost,Sal, Stands back! I'm gonna puts my moves on her. [He wiggles his hips at Leela and hoots.] Whoas!
Parasites Lost,Fry, That jerk! No one hoots at my captain unless they're prepared to take it to the next level!
Parasites Lost,Leela," Fry, please. That's sweet but I'd rather not even dignify them with an ass-whooping!"
Parasites Lost,Sal," Hey, sexy mama, let's get busy and freaky in that order!"
Parasites Lost,Fry," Hey, jumbo! How would you like it if Leela said you were sexy and she wanted to make love with you?"
Parasites Lost,Sal," Eh, I gots five minutes. She looks pretty good for a truck stop chick!"
Parasites Lost,Fry, You take that back! She does not look good for a truck stop chick!
Parasites Lost,Sal," Yeah, you're right. She don't gots enough meat for a guy like me."
Parasites Lost,Fry, She does too! She's loaded with meat! She's got more meat than a cow! [Leela hovers down and pulls Fry away by the hair.] Ow!
Parasites Lost,Sal, [laughing] More meat than a cow!
Parasites Lost,Fry, I can't please Leela no matter what I do. I just want her to like me.
Parasites Lost,Bender," Well there's always hope. [He pats him on the back and laughs.] C'mon, we gotta go fix the plasma fusion boiler."
Parasites Lost,Bender, Who are you?
Parasites Lost,Scruffy, Scruffy. The janitor.
Parasites Lost,Bender, Well why aren't you fixing the boiler?
Parasites Lost,Scruffy, Schedule conflict.
Parasites Lost,Bender, There! Fixed forever.
Parasites Lost,Scruffy," Scruffy's gonna die the way he lived. [He continues looking at the magazine. The boiler explodes. Fry and Bender scream.] Oh, marmalade!"
Parasites Lost,Zoidberg," Oh, the hypochondriac's back! So what is it this time?"
Parasites Lost,Fry," Well, my lead pipe hurts a little."
Parasites Lost,Zoidberg, That's normal. Next patient.
Parasites Lost,Bender, He's a witch!
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth," Fry, did you eat anything unusual recently?"
Parasites Lost,Fry, No.
Parasites Lost,Leela, What about that bathroom egg salad from the truck stop?
Parasites Lost,Fry, I've had better.
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth," Egg salad? Hmm. Zoidberg will have to examine your gastrointestinal tract. Come, everyone. Give Fry some privacy."
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth," If you can't see well enough through the two-way mirror, there'll be a close-up on this video screen."
Parasites Lost,Zoidberg, Hmm. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. [He holds up an endoscope. Fry opens his mouth.] Guess again.
Parasites Lost,Amy, Gross!
Parasites Lost,Bender," [leaning over her shoulder] Go, man! Go!"
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth, Watch for any subtle irregularity in Fry's bowel.
Parasites Lost,Amy, It's gorgeous. That place used to be a big dump.
Parasites Lost,Bender, Oh! Ew!
Parasites Lost,Amy, Worms? Ew! Puke-a-tronic!
Parasites Lost,Leela, So the eggs in that egg salad sandwich were--
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth, Correct! Worm eggs! And the mayonnaise was probably none too fresh either.
Parasites Lost,Hermes," It's nauseating, mon! [He chomps a handful of popcorn.] Is there no way to get rid of the disgusting maggots?"
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth," Only one. We'll have to travel deep inside Fry, in this!"
Parasites Lost,Bender, Shotgun!
Parasites Lost,Zoidberg, [almost simultaneous] Shotgun!
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth," In each gastro-survival kit, you'll find a rain slicker, a disposable fun camera, and something to protect you against bacteria -- a harpoon!"
Parasites Lost,Bender," Yo, old guy, why do we have to use those tiny micro-droids? Can't you just shrink us?"
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth," Oh, my, no. That would require extremely tiny atoms, and have you priced those lately? I'm not made of money! Leave me alone!"
Parasites Lost,Zoidberg, Me next!
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid," Anyhoo, your net suits will let you experience Fry's worm-infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them."
Parasites Lost,Zoidberg-Droid, There's no part of that sentence I didn't like.
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid, Is everyone present?
Parasites Lost,Amy-Droid, Right on!
Parasites Lost,Bender-Droid, Uh-huh.
Parasites Lost,Hermes-Droid, Definitely.
Parasites Lost,Zoidberg-Droid, Yes.
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid," Here's the plan  [He turns on a holographic version of Fry's body in the middle of the table.] We'll enter the ear, drip down the back of the throat and make for the bowel. There, we'll irritate the pelvic splanchnic ganglion and cause an intestinal spasm, expelling, among other things, the parasites."
Parasites Lost,Bender-Droid," I'll tell Fry to wash out, among other things, his ear."
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid," No! Fry can't know anything about the mission. If he finds out, the worms will try to defend themselves. They know everything he knows."
Parasites Lost,Bender-Droid, They know how to make ice cream soup?
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid," Leela, your role is to distract Fry so he doesn't notice what we're up to."
Parasites Lost,Leela, [echoing] Can do!
Parasites Lost,Amy-Droid," Leela, you should really try a facial scrub, for your pores."
Parasites Lost,Leela, Look! A starling!
Parasites Lost,Fry, [looking away] Really?
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid, [whispering] Sh! Be very quiet. We're in the ear.
Parasites Lost,Amy-Droid," [whispering] OK, Professor."
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid, [shouting] What?
Parasites Lost,Fry, What about what?
Parasites Lost,Leela," Uh ... what if we go for a walk, possibly, because it's such a lovely day, perhaps."
Parasites Lost,Fry, I'd love to!
Parasites Lost,Hermes-Droid, We gotta get someplace where he won't stick his finger!
Parasites Lost,Bender-Droid, It's hopeless! Abandon ship!
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid, Wait! We just have to get past the eardrum.
Parasites Lost,Hermes-Droid, [from ship] What are those worms doing to Fry's brain?
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid, [from ship] They're giving it a complete tune-up. A cursory glance would suggest they've doubled his thinking power.
Parasites Lost,Hermes-Droid, [from ship] My God! Soon he'll be smarter than Cher!
Parasites Lost,Fry," Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious how an aromatic chain of hydrocarbons can evoke our deepest emotions. [He hold the flowers out to Leela.] For you."
Parasites Lost,Leela," That's such a beautiful thought, Fry. And what's more amazing, you expressed it without spewing crumbs at me."
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid," Brace yourselves, everyone. We're entering the interior of Fry's nose."
Parasites Lost,Bender-Droid, We're at finger alert five.
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid, Let's just pray nothing stimulates the delicate smell receptors. [whispering] Nobody make a smell.
Parasites Lost,Zoidberg-Droid, Quick! We can escape through that nasal capillary into the sinus.
Parasites Lost,Hermes-Droid, Strange. Usually you don't know anything about human anatomy.
Parasites Lost,Zoidberg-Droid," I learned it from a decongestant commercial. [echoing] ""Soothing action, action, action, action..."""
Parasites Lost,Bender-Droid, Where are we? The ass?
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid," We're in the heart. Better known as ""The Love Muscle""."
Parasites Lost,Zoidberg-Droid, Where the food is digested.
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid," We should be safe, just so long as nothing makes it beat faster."
Parasites Lost,Bender-Droid, Abandon ship!
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid, No! Set course for that cholesterol-encrusted valve.
Parasites Lost,Zoidberg-Droid, It's good cholesterol but it spreads like bad cholesterol!
Parasites Lost,Amy-Droid, [from ship] Look! They're jazz-ercising Fry's muscles!
Parasites Lost,Hermes-Droid, He'll be as strong and flexible as Gumby and Hercules combined!
Parasites Lost,Zoidberg-Droid, Gumbercules? I love that guy!
Parasites Lost,Leela, It's that jerk from the truck stop! [Sal leans against a barrier munching a sandwich.] Let's cross the street and try to blend in with that crowd of pimps.
Parasites Lost,Fry," I don't think so. [He marches up to Sal.] Sir, I believe you owe this lady an apology."
Parasites Lost,Leela," Fry, no! He's bulging with what could be muscles. [Fry tears off his shirt à la Groundskeeper Willie from The Simpsons revealing what definitely are muscles.] Ooh!"
Parasites Lost,Sal," I gots your apologys right heres! [He whips out a knife. Fry grabs his arm and slams him down on the pavement and kicks him in front of Leela. Sal lies flat on his back and groans.] Sorrys, ma'am. I've learnsed a lesson about not ogling cans that I won't soons forgets."
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid," [from ship] Ah, the stomach  Scenic gateway to the bowel."
Parasites Lost,Bender-Droid, Abandon ship!
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid, No! Don't give up now! We're but a stone's throw from the pyloric sphincter.
Parasites Lost,Bender-Droid, [from ship] Hooray!
Parasites Lost,Zoidberg-Droid, [from ship] Hooray!
Parasites Lost,Hermes-Droid, [from ship] We made it!
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid, There it is! The stately capitol of Fry's bowel. A heavily-guarded fortress surrounding the pelvic splanchnic ganglion.
Parasites Lost,Zoidberg-Droid, I've heard of that! Who said I haven't?
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid," If we can stimulate that nerve, the bowel will convulse, expelling the entire worm society."
Parasites Lost,Hermes-Droid, But what about the worms in the other parts of his body?
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid," Listen, this is gonna be one hell of a bowel movement. Afterwards he'll be lucky if he has any bones left!"
Parasites Lost,Bender-Droid," Alright, let's mush some worms!"
Parasites Lost,Worm Mayor, Worms to battle stations!
Parasites Lost,Leela," I had a great time today. The flowers, the puddle, the way you hurt that guy. But can I aks you something?"
Parasites Lost,Fry, Anything.
Parasites Lost,Leela, Why did you do all that stuff?
Parasites Lost,Fry," Leela, there's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time but every time I try I get nervous and my mouth feels like it's stuffed with peanut butter, even when it's not."
Parasites Lost,Leela, What is it? Is it about Bender?
Parasites Lost,Fry," No, it's about you and me."
Parasites Lost,Leela, And Bender?
Parasites Lost,Fry, Bender's not involved. [He reaches out and holds Leela's hands.] Leela ... I love you.
Parasites Lost,Leela, You do?
Parasites Lost,Fry," Yes. But it's only recently that I've been able to articulate my thoughts. I love you, Leela, and I always have."
Parasites Lost,Leela," Fry, that's the sweetest, most wonderful-- Wait! Recently? Like since you ate that toilet sandwich?"
Parasites Lost,Fry, Yeah! I don't know why but my life really turned around that day.
Parasites Lost,Leela, Stay here.
Parasites Lost,Waitress, Freshen your noc-a-tina?
Parasites Lost,Fry, Please. [She pours.] I need something to settle my stomach.
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid, The nerve is through here. Where's Zoidberg?
Parasites Lost,Zoidberg-Droid, Yippie-ki-yay! You'll never guess where I've been!
Parasites Lost,Bender-Droid, [from outside] One! Two! Three!
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid, There it is! The pelvic splanchnic ganglion. [They walk towards it.] Tickle it and get ready for the ride of your lives!
Parasites Lost,Leela-Droid, Don't even think about tickling that ganglion!
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid," Leela, you're just in time to help. If we don't get rid of the worms now, they'll burrow so deep into the bowel that not even Hermes' famous jerk prunes could dislodge them!"
Parasites Lost,Hermes-Droid," I call it ""Caribbean Drain-o""!"
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth-Droid, Fry will be stuck with the worms forever.
Parasites Lost,Leela-Droid, Perfect.
Parasites Lost,Zoidberg-Droid, Ouch!
Parasites Lost,Amy, I'm OK.
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth," Leela, you ignorant dope! Now the worms will be in Fry forever."
Parasites Lost,Leela, So? Did you ever stop to think that Fry is better off with worms?
Parasites Lost,Farnsworth," Oh, that's stupid!"
Parasites Lost,Fry," If anyone wants to tell me what's going on here, I'll be in the lounge."
Parasites Lost,Fry," Of all the parasites I've had over the years, these worms are among the-- Hell! They are the best! Leela, how can I ever repay you for saving them?"
Parasites Lost,Leela, [sexfully] I'll think of something.
Parasites Lost,Bender, 'Ello! What's all this then?
Parasites Lost,Fry, Apartment 1I. The old me would have made a joke about that!
Parasites Lost,Leela," [opening the door] I should warn you, it's a little under-furnished."
Parasites Lost,Leela, I'm thinking of having a window installed.
Parasites Lost,Fry, I think the view's perfect already!
Parasites Lost,Leela," Oh, that's the corniest thing I've ever heard! Let me show you the bedroom."
Parasites Lost,Fry, Wait. In a minute.
Parasites Lost,Leela," A holophonor? Only a few people in the whole universe can play that, and they're not very good at it."
Parasites Lost,Fry, They don't have you to inspire them.
Parasites Lost,Leela," I don't have words to say how wonderful you are, Fry. I haven't felt this happy since double-soup Tuesday at the orphanarium."
Parasites Lost,Fry," When I'm with you, every day seems like double-soup Tuesday."
Parasites Lost,Leela," Oh, Fry! I love what you've become."
Parasites Lost,Fry, What I've become.
Parasites Lost,Leela, What is it?
Parasites Lost,Fry, There's just something I have to find out.
Parasites Lost,Fry-Droid, Who controls this bowel?
Parasites Lost,Worm Guard #1, Who wants to know?
Parasites Lost,Worm Mayor, I am the Lord Mayor of Cologne.
Parasites Lost,Fry-Droid," You mean ""colon""?"
Parasites Lost,Worm Mayor, State your business!
Parasites Lost,Fry-Droid," Your Excellency, have you ever been in love?"
Parasites Lost,Worm Mayor, No. I thought I was once but then I remember our species reproduces with a cloud of spores.
Parasites Lost,Fry-Droid," Well, a wonderful girl loves me. But I need to know if it's really me she loves, or just what you worms have made of me. That's why, with all due respect, I'm asking you to leave."
Parasites Lost,Worm Mayor," Listen, you  I was born here, I raised a cloud of children here, my ancestors came over here on the sandwich. [He draws his sword.] No one can make me leave."
Parasites Lost,Fry-Droid, Everyone out of my body or the brain gets it!
Parasites Lost,Worm Mayor, He's bluffing! No creature would willingly make an idiot out of itself.
Parasites Lost,Fry-Droid," Obviously you've never been in love! [He cuts through the nerve and the worms fall to the floor. Fry swings on the cut nerve and lands on a catwalk. He runs along it, slashing nerves as he goes.] Ow! Ow! Ow! [The worms look up and gasp. Fry stands next to a lobe at the end of the catwalk.] Now, the hand-eye co-ordination lobe."
Parasites Lost,Worm Guard #1," Stop it, man!"
Parasites Lost,Worm Mayor," You've damaged your brain, Universe, but no more than a week of binge drinking or five minutes on a cell phone."
Parasites Lost,Fry-Droid," I was just working my way towards the medulla oblongata, control centre of the heart and lungs. And if I kill myself, you die with me."
Parasites Lost,Worm Guard #2," Wait a minute, man!"
Parasites Lost,Fry-Droid," I hope Satan has a nice colon, 'cause that's where you're gonna be living!"
Parasites Lost,Worm Mayor, Stop! We'll leave. [He puts his sword away.] But one day you'll be eating a fast-food burger and boom! You'll be crawling with us again. Ever wonder what makes special sauce so special? Yo!
Parasites Lost,Leela, Fry? I missed you. Did you find out what you needed to find out?
Parasites Lost,Fry," I'm about to. [He holds up his holophonor.] Leela, let me play for you one for time."
Parasites Lost,Leela, You don't have to do that. I'm still seduced from before.
Parasites Lost,Fry," Please, it's important to me."
Parasites Lost,Leela, What's that supposed to mean?
Parasites Lost,Fry, I don't know. I got nervous and I started thinking about neck bolts. [He reaches around to hug Leela but he knocks the vase of Leela's flowers off the table with his holophonor. The vase breaks.] Wow! Did you see that vase break? It was all like--
Parasites Lost,Leela, What's happened to you?
Parasites Lost,Fry, Nothing. I got rid of the worms.
Parasites Lost,Leela, What? Why would you do that?
Parasites Lost,Fry," Leela, I had worms. I needed to know who you loved. Me or them."
Parasites Lost,Leela, Well ... which of you wrote me that sonnet?
Parasites Lost,Fry," I did ... I think. It was probably about 50/50. But that's how I really felt about you, I swear!"
Parasites Lost,Leela, I don't know.
Parasites Lost,Fry," Please. Give me a chance to be romantic on my own. I've got a baggy of massage oil, and I'm gonna give you my super back rub, just like a I used to give Amy when I was going out with her, and she always seemed-- Uh-oh!"
Parasites Lost,Bender," Sorry you struck out, sausage link."
Parasites Lost,Bender," If it's any consolation, my life is great! Babes! Bucks! I got it all!"
Parasites Lost,Fry," Well, at least I learned Leela's a lost cause. I give up."
Parasites Lost,Bender, There you go! [He yawns.] Goodnight. I gotta get up early to go parasailing with movie stars!
Parasites Lost,,
A Tale of Two Santas,Linda," [on TV] In what has become a winter tradition, members of the Zarlon 7 Polar Bear Club today took the plunge into a river of liquid ammonia."
A Tale of Two Santas,Morbo, [on TV] There were no survivors.
A Tale of Two Santas,Linda," [on TV] Takes all kinds! And now, with his annual Xmas message, here's the head of the Xmas Safety Council, the head of Walter Cronkite."
A Tale of Two Santas,Walter Cronkite's head," [on TV] Season's warnings, Linda and Morbo."
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender, This guy's too trustworthy. What's his angle?
A Tale of Two Santas,Cronkite," [on TV] In all the tinsel and terror of the holiday season we too often underestimate that murderous brute better known as Santa Claus. With images of last year's gingerbread massacre freshly baked into our memories, I remind you to bolt your doors, say goodbye to your pets and lock your children in the closet. This is Walter Cronkite saying, ""I told you so""."
A Tale of Two Santas,Hermes, Sacred boa of West and Eastern Samoa. We've got to secure for Santa's arrival.
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, Just as well. I'm getting tired of this wood show.
A Tale of Two Santas,Farnsworth," Cover that fireplace, confound you! I've only a few years to live. I don't wanna spend them dead."
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela, We're pushing as hard as we can.
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," Oh, pushing!"
A Tale of Two Santas,Farnsworth," Oh, we're doomed! Every year we're doomed. Thanks be I had these bullet-proof shutters installed."
A Tale of Two Santas,Farnsworth," Bring it on, Santa! That bloodthirsty cadaver junkie can't touch us as long as we're not stupid enough to leave this building."
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, [cheering] Alright!
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela, [cheering] Yeah!
A Tale of Two Santas,Farnsworth," In a related matter, you'll be delivering this sack of children's letters directly to Santa at his death fortress on Neptune."
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, These letters are real butt-nutters! [He opens one.] Listen to this one  [reading] Dear Santa.
A Tale of Two Santas,Girl," [voice-over; writing] Please, please don't bring me any gifts. The bicycle you fired at me last year from your bicycle gun really tore up my insides."
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela, Awful! Let's read some more. [reading] Dear Santa.
A Tale of Two Santas,Boy, [voice-over; writing] Please bring me a coffin for Grandpa. You choked him with a chestnut last year and he's beginning to smell a lot like Xmas if you know what I mean.
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry," It's not fair. In my day Xmas was supposed to bring people together, not blow them apart!"
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," Sure, but who's going to do anything about it? Certainly not us. No, sir!"
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry," Certainly yes us, uh-huh, sir! We've gotta bring back the kind of Xmas I remember."
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela, Fry's right. It's time to sit on Santa's lap -- and hard!
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela," Oh, look! A cute little welcoming party."
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #1, Hey! Wanna buy a tiny little kidney?
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #2, I'll let you punch me for a buck.
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry," Uh, look; we've got mail for Santa. Are you his elves?"
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #2, We're not elves. We're Neptunians.
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #1, We're just shrimp-y because he doesn't feed us.
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #2, You hit me! You owe me a dollar.
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #3," Hey, you got any food? Old teabags, chewed gum, apple cores? Come on! We're starving here!"
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, But you live in a gingerbread house.
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #4," Hey! It's food or shelter, not both."
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender, You lazy runts! Don't you get paid for making the toys?
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #4," Who said ""toys""?"
A Tale of Two Santas,Neptunians," Toys? Toys? Who said ""toys""?"
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #2," False alarm, folks! There's no reason to make toys since Santa judges everyone to be naughty."
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, That's it! I'm gonna deliver a gift of my boot up Santa's chimney. Where is he?
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #2, There! In his ice fortress.
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela, We'll need help getting in. Any volunteers?
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #1, I'll help you!
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #2," Ah, phooey!"
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #2, An omen?
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #1, Dinner!
A Tale of Two Santas,Santa," Let's see who's been naughty, and who's been naughty! [He pushes a button and Clamps and Joey Mouse Pad appear on the screen, beating a man. The man screams in pain.] Mobsters beating up a shopkeeper for protection money. Very naughty! [He writes.] Shopkeeper's not paying their protection money. Exactly as naughty! [He presses another button and Scruffy appears sitting on some steps. He rubs his nose.] I saw that! [He writes. A squeaking comes from behind him.] Huh?"
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #2, We brought your mail.
A Tale of Two Santas,Santa," Don't you ever knock? Who knows what naughty things I could be watching? I get New Orleans on this thing, you know!"
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #2, Don't kill us!
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela," Santa's a robot, so we should be able to destroy him with a logical paradox. Bender, you'd better cover your ears."
A Tale of Two Santas,Santa, Holy night! Intruders!
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela," Hold it, Santa! [She nods at Bender who covers his ears and sings to himself.] Consider this  You are programmed to destroy the naughty, but many of those you destroy are in fact nice. I submit to you that you are naughty and, logically, you must destroy yourself."
A Tale of Two Santas,Santa, Nice try. But my head was built with paradox-absorbing crumple-zones.
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela, Wait! This is what we're running from!
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, Faster! Faster!
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, Why aren't we moving?
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela, I don't know. Usually when I do stuff like this the ship moves.
A Tale of Two Santas,Santa," Ho, ho-- Eh?"
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, He's trapped!
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #2, Now we can make toys again!
A Tale of Two Santas,Neptunians, [chanting] Toys! Toys! Toys!
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, And I can deliver them. Billions and billions in one night.
A Tale of Two Santas,Santa, Ha! No human could do all that.
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, Evil Knievel could!
A Tale of Two Santas,Santa, Nuh-uh!
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," Santa's right. We need some sort of robot. [There is silence. The Neptunians, Santa, Fry and Leela stare at Bender.] Aw, crap! I'm some sort of robot."
A Tale of Two Santas,Neptunians, Hooray! [They throw their clothes in the air.] Hooray! [They throw their underwear in the air.] Hooray!
A Tale of Two Santas,Santa, Bender can't be Santa! He wasn't built to Yuletide specifications.
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," Oh, yeah? Well I wasn't built to steal Leela's purse either. [He pulls it out of his coat.] But that didn't stop me."
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela, Bender!
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender, Bow to your new Santa!
A Tale of Two Santas,Neptunians, Our hero!
A Tale of Two Santas,Neptunians," [singing] We are free and fairly sober,"
A Tale of Two Santas,With so many toys to build.,
A Tale of Two Santas,Neptunians," [singing] The machines are kinda tricky,"
A Tale of Two Santas,"Probably someone will be killed,",
A Tale of Two Santas,But we gladly work for nothing--,
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, [singing] Which is good because we don't intend to pay.
A Tale of Two Santas,All, [singing] The elves are back to work today!
A Tale of Two Santas,Neptunians, [singing] Hooray!
A Tale of Two Santas,[They saw logs and they go down a conveyor belt.],
A Tale of Two Santas,"We have just a couple hours,",
A Tale of Two Santas,"To make several billion gifts,",
A Tale of Two Santas,[A Neptunian boxes some toys. Another adds the polystyrene S's.],
A Tale of Two Santas,And the labour isn't easy--,
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela," [singing] Then you'll all work triple shifts,"
A Tale of Two Santas,You can make the job go quicker if you turn up the controls to super-speed.,
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry," ,  and  [singing] It's back to work on Xmas Eve!"
A Tale of Two Santas,Neptunians, [cheering] Hooray!
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela," [singing] And though you're cold and sore and ugly,"
A Tale of Two Santas,Your pride will mask the pain.,
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, [singing] Let my happy smile warm your hearts--
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #5, [singing] There's a toy lodged in my brain!
A Tale of Two Santas,Neptunians," [singing] We are getting awfully tired,"
A Tale of Two Santas,"And we can't work any faster,",
A Tale of Two Santas,"And we're very, very sorry--",
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," [singing] Why you selfish little bastards,"
A Tale of Two Santas,"Do you want the kids to think that Santa's just a crummy, empty-handed jerk?",
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #6, Ow!
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender, [singing] Then shut your yaps and back to work.
A Tale of Two Santas,Neptunians," [singing] Now it's very nearly Xmas,"
A Tale of Two Santas,"And we've done the best we could,",
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, [singing] These toys soldiers are poorly painted.
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela, [singing] And they're made from inferior wood.
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," [singing] I should give you all a beating,"
A Tale of Two Santas,But I really have to fly.,
A Tale of Two Santas,Santa," [singing] If I weren't stuck here frozen,"
A Tale of Two Santas,I'd harpoon you in the eye.,
A Tale of Two Santas,Neptunians," [singing] Now it's back into our tenements,"
A Tale of Two Santas,To drown ourselves in rye.,
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela," [singing] You did the best you could,"
A Tale of Two Santas,I guess that some of these gorillas are OK.,
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #7, We're adequate!
A Tale of Two Santas,All, [singing] The elves have rescued Xmas Day! Hooray!
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," [stupid voice] Duh! Gee, Bender, how you gonna get through these bars? [normal voice] I dunno, moron, suppose I bend them? [stupid voice] Duh, OK!"
A Tale of Two Santas,Girl, Mommy! Mommy! Santa's through the perimeter!
A Tale of Two Santas,Mrs. Grant," This is it, kids. Take your suicide pills so you won't suffer."
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," No, wait! I'm the good Santa. I've got toys ... at very reasonable prices!"
A Tale of Two Santas,Jeffery, Don't listen to him. He's the father of all lies and the uncle of all tricks!
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender, But I come bearing Tri-ominos!
A Tale of Two Santas,Mrs. Grant, Go for the shins!
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender, [groaning] One down...
A Tale of Two Santas,Petunia," Well, hello there, handsome! [She opens a cookie jar.] Won't you have a cookie?"
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," Uh, don't mind if I do. [He reaches in and a mousetrap snaps on his fingers.] Ow! What's in these things?"
A Tale of Two Santas,Petunia, Why don't you slip into something more fiery?
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender, Ow!
A Tale of Two Santas,Kwanzaabot," Yo, Kringle! What happened to you, doll?"
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," Oh, it's awful, Kwanzaabot. Everyone hates me."
A Tale of Two Santas,Kwanzaabot," At least they understand you, you know what I'm sayin'? Ain't nobody down with this Kwanzaa tip."
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender, Hey! Maybe you could lend me a hand with these deliveries.
A Tale of Two Santas,Kwanzaabot," No time! I gotta hand out the traditional Kwanzaa book. [He holds up a book called ""What The Hell Is Kwanzaa?"" and sighs.] I've been givin' these out for 647 years!"
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, Ah! Bathtub eggnog! Just the way Grandma used to drink. [He tastes it and spits it out.] Ew! It went sour!
A Tale of Two Santas,Zoidberg, Can't I have a scented bath in peace?
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela," Remember, Professor, Bender is Santa. So we don't need to hurt him, right?"
A Tale of Two Santas,Farnsworth," Yes, yes, yes. You sound like a broken mp3!"
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," Ho, ho-- [Farnsworth blasts Bender in the chest with a shotgun and he falls back.] Ow!"
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela, [shouting] Professor! Don't you remember what I told you?
A Tale of Two Santas,Farnsworth, [shouting] No!
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," [crying] Oh, there's gotta be a better way."
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," Bender, you're a genius!"
A Tale of Two Santas,Vyolet, This creates an unrealistic standard of beauty!
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender, Now it's time for Santa to screw open his present!
A Tale of Two Santas,Smitty, It's Santa! And we got him cornered!
A Tale of Two Santas,URL," Aw, I smell a juicy promotion for me."
A Tale of Two Santas,Smitty, And a juicy re-hiring-back-onto-the-force for me!
A Tale of Two Santas,Bailiff, This Xmas Day session of court will come to order. The Honourable Judge Whitey presiding.
A Tale of Two Santas,Whitey," Santa Claus, you stand accused of crimes against humanity. How do you plead?"
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender, Not Santa!
A Tale of Two Santas,Farnsworth, There he is again!
A Tale of Two Santas,Hyper-Chicken," Now, Pramala, I know it's scary in that there witness box but t'ain't no need to fear me. [He clucks and she flinches.] I'm sorry, I thought you was corn. Now, would you please point at that robot over there. [She points and the court gasps.] No further questions. [He walks off, sits down and opens his briefcase. There are nine chicks inside.] Daddy done good, huh?"
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender, Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?
A Tale of Two Santas,Pramala, Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender, And yet you haven't said what I told you to say. How can any of us trust you?
A Tale of Two Santas,Whitey, Quit badgering the witness!
A Tale of Two Santas,Hyper-Chicken, Badger? Where?
A Tale of Two Santas,Whitey," Whereas I have a ham dinner with mayonnaise waiting for me at my mansion, I find the defendant guilty. [The court gasps.] Santa Claus, I hereby sentence you to be executed at sundown."
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela, It's not fair. I just hope that dumb chicken is ashamed of himself.
A Tale of Two Santas,Smitty, Deactivated robot walking. We got a deactivated robot walking here.
A Tale of Two Santas,Robot," Hey, Santa, when you see the Robot Devil, tell him I'm-a comin'!"
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," Hey, that guy said to tell you that--"
A Tale of Two Santas,Robot Devil, I heard him!
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #1," Greetings, masters. My companion and I made lots of toys."
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela," Outta my way, shrimp-oh. We're here to bring Santa back so we can prove Bender's innocent."
A Tale of Two Santas,Santa, Do what you will. But we'll see who has the last ho.
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela, There.
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry," Oh, no! The ice is melting!"
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela, The pollution from the factory! It caused a greenhouse effect.
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #1, That would explain this heat.
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, And your breezy short-shorts!
A Tale of Two Santas,Aide #2," Uh, yeah! That would explain it."
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, Hurry! We've gotta think of another way to save Bender or Xmas will be ruined!
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela, Especially for Bender.
A Tale of Two Santas,Santa," Look out, Earth. I'm dreaming of a red Xmas."
A Tale of Two Santas,Poopenmeyer," Ah, good old Maggie! [His watch flies off his arm and sticks to a magnet followed by a flask and a iron from his pocket.] Eh? When I pull this switch, these powerful electromagnets will tear you limb-from-limb, killing you in the most humane possible manner."
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," But, Mr. Mayor, that doesn't sound humane."
A Tale of Two Santas,Poopenmeyer," It is for the witnesses because it's not boring! [He turns to the applauding witnesses and waves to them. He puts on his executioner mask and walks over to the switch.] The instant this random number generator reaches zero, you'll be executed."
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender, Aw!
A Tale of Two Santas,Poopenmeyer, Ten. Three. Twelve. Three again.
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela, Stop the execution!
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender, Leela!
A Tale of Two Santas,Poopenmeyer, Fifteen. Negative eight.
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela, You got the wrong Santa. And I'll prove it.
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, I'm Santa Claus!
A Tale of Two Santas,Poopenmeyer, What? Twenty-seven.
A Tale of Two Santas,Hermes, No. I'm Santa Claus.
A Tale of Two Santas,Poopenmeyer, Six.
A Tale of Two Santas,Amy," [disguised, deeper voice] We're also Santa Claus."
A Tale of Two Santas,Zoidberg, And I'm his friend Jesus!
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry," Your Mayor-ness, if you execute him, you have to execute all of us."
A Tale of Two Santas,Poopenmeyer," You people aren't Santa. You're not even robots! Ninety-one. How dare you lie in front of Jesus! [The display shows ""00"".] Hey! Zero!"
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," No! Not the magnets! [His eyes widen.] [singing] Swing low, sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home. [The witnesses applaud.] Swing low, sweet..."
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, This is horrible.
A Tale of Two Santas,Farnsworth, But it's not boring!
A Tale of Two Santas,Santa," Ho, ho, ho!"
A Tale of Two Santas,Poopenmeyer," My God! The real Santa! Get him, Jesus!"
A Tale of Two Santas,Zoidberg, I help those who help themselves.
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender, Santa! You saved my life. Please don't kill me!
A Tale of Two Santas,Santa," I'm not here to kill you, Bender! I need you to help me save Xmas."
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," Gee whiz, Santa! You want me to help you?"
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, Don't do it! He's evil!
A Tale of Two Santas,Santa," I know he is but I have no choice. I'm running late and if I don't complete my brutal rampage, well, it just wouldn't be Xmas. I guess what I'm asking is  Bender, won't you join my slaying tonight?"
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender, Well ... 'tis the season!
A Tale of Two Santas,Man, My hair!
A Tale of Two Santas,Woman, My wedding cake!
A Tale of Two Santas,Santa, Let it snow!
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," Merry Xmas, kids!"
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela," This wangs chun! After all the good we tried to do, Xmas turned out as rotten as ever."
A Tale of Two Santas,Farnsworth, No heat.
A Tale of Two Santas,Amy, No power.
A Tale of Two Santas,Hermes, Huddled together in fear like lice in a burning wig.
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, Wait a second! Maybe your futuristic Xmas isn't so rotten after all.
A Tale of Two Santas,Leela," What are you talking about, you crouton? You said it yourself  Xmas should be about bringing people together, not blowing them apart."
A Tale of Two Santas,Fry, But don't you see? Fear has brought us together. That's the magic of Xmas!
A Tale of Two Santas,Farnsworth, That's a big crock of-- [There is an explosion outside.] Hold me!
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," On, Trasher! On, Smasher! [The Kwanzaabot flies alongside.] Hey, Kwanzaabot, where you off to?"
A Tale of Two Santas,Kwanzaabot," Ah, you didn't hear about it? Chanukah Zombie's having a luau at the B'nai B'rith! You comin'?"
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender, Word!
A Tale of Two Santas,Santa," By the way, Bender, here's a small token of my appreciation for being Santa while I was trapped in the ice."
A Tale of Two Santas,Bender," Hey, chief, you screwed up. There's nothing in here."
A Tale of Two Santas,Santa," Oh, it might appear empty but the message is clear  Play Santa again and I'll kill you next year! [He kicks Bender out of the sleigh into the fiery city below and flies away.] Ho, ho, ho!"
A Tale of Two Santas,,
The Luck of the Fryrish,Doctor," Push, Mrs. Fry. You're almost there."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mr. Fry," You can do it, honey! Squeeze one out for America."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mrs. Fry," [shouting] Hey, keep it down! It's the 9th inning."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Commentator, [on radio] Here's the 02 pitch to Craypool. He's taking all the way for a called strike three!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mrs. Fry," Swing the bat, you bum!"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Doctor, It's a boy. And look at that red hair!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mr. Fry, You sayin' my son's a commie?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Commentator, [on radio] And Grote leans into the pitch. It hits him! The Mets win!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mrs. Fry, This is the happiest day of my life!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Doctor," Here's your baby, ma'am."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mrs. Fry," Yeah, OK, thanks."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mr. Fry," So, what should we name him?"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mrs. Fry," Uh, you pick. I picked dinner last night."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mr. Fry," Well, I was thinking of Philip. After those screwdrivers?"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mrs. Fry," That's a fantastic idea. More morphine, please."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mr. Fry," Look, Yancy, it's your baby brother, Philip."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy, I wanna be named Philip! Me Philip! Me Philip!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mr. Fry," Son, your name is Yancy, just like me and my grandfather and so on. All the way back to minuteman Yancy Fry, who blasted commies in the American Revolution. [Yancy salutes. Mr. Fry attaches a mobile to Philip's bed. It has planets and a spaceship on it.] Philip, until I find a suitable model of an ICBM, you'll have to make do learnin' to fear this toy spacecraft."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy, Mine! Mine!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, [shouting] C'mon!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Hermes, [shouting] Baby needs a new pair of shoes!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Zoidberg, To hell with your spoiled baby! I need those shoes!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Announcer," [on loudspeaker] And it's a dead heat! They're checking the electron microscope. And the winner is ... [A man holds up a ""3"" in a window.] ... number 3, in a quantum finish."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Farnsworth, No fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela," How'd you do, Fry?"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, I'll tell you when my horse finishes ... bad.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mr. Wong, In today's field we own four horses and two jockeys.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mrs. Wong," We just put our best jockey out to stud, Amy. He's perfect for you!"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Jockey," Hey, baby! Ever do it in a suitcase?"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender, Ooh! Look! It's the Centaur race.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," Come on! Come on! Hey, Leela, how about a kiss for good luck? [Leela sighs and reluctantly kisses him on the cheek.] I meant tongue luck."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Announcer, [on loudspeaker] And the winner is number four -- Steven.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, I am so unlucky! I've run over black cats that were luckier than me.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Paper-hatted salesman," [shouting] Get your piping-hot horse burgers, horse fries, horse cake and shakes. We got tongue straight from the horse's mouth."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela, Hmm.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Hermes, It all sounds good.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Paper-hatted salesman, All our horses are 100% horse-fed for that double-horse juiced-in goodness.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela, I'll have the cholesterol-free omelette with horse beaters.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Paper-hatted salesman," And you, sir, how can I horse you?"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Hermes, I'll have a horse coke.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Paper-hatted salesman, Horse Pepsi OK?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Hermes, Nay.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Jockey, Hey! What are you doing?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender, This.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," Dear Horse God, I know I don't usually pray to you. Sometimes I doubt you even exist. But if you're willing to grant me luck, please, stamp your hoof once. [The bell rings and only one horse leaves the box. The other horses stumble out tiredly. Bender chuckles.] Come on, number six! Move it! [Number six yawns and sits down.] Don't do that! What are you-- [He yawns.] Man, it's contagious!"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Announcer, [on loudspeaker] And the winner is Harry Trotter by the entire racetrack.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender, That'll teach those other horses to take drugs!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," That's it! You can only take my money for so long before you take it all, and I say enough. [He reaches into his shirt.] I've got one dollar left, and this one I'm holding on to! [A sudden gust of wind takes the dollar from his hand.] Oh, no you don't! [The dollar falls into a Slurm machine and comes back out and flies away again. It comes to rest on an overhead wire. Fry climbs the pole.] I may not know much about horses but I know a lot about doing anything for one dollar! [He reaches over to the dollar but it is out of reach. He climbs down the pole and returns with a rake.] If you think bad luck can defeat me then you don't know my name is Philip J.--"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Paper-hatted salesman, That is one unlucky guy!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, Kareem's got the sky hook but Philip J. Fry's got the space hook!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy, Yancy drives; he goes up with his patented space hook!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, Hey! That's my patented space hook! You stole it!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy, You're not the president of it!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, Holy camolie! A seven-leaf clover!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy, [shouting; mocking] I'm dying of old age!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, Game over! Phil wins! Yancy's fans are stunned! There'll be no celebration at the Yancy-dome!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy, Lucky.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela," Well, someone's in a good mode."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender," Let's just say I lucked-out at the track! Also, I rigged one race."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, Pah! I'd have won a lot of money too if I still had my lucky seven-leaf clover. Plus I'd still have my hair.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Hairbot," I got your page, Mr. Fry. Your new hair is ready."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Amy, So whatever happened to this seven-leaf clover?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, I hid it in a secret hiding place whose location I never told anyone. Not even Scruffy.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Zoidberg," So the clover is still in the hiding place, maybe?"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," Hey, yeah! Maybe it is still there. Underground in the ruins of Old New York, helping some ant defeat another ant or helping some piece of dirt turn its luck around."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Farnsworth, Dirt doesn't need luck.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," I'm going down there to get my clover back. Some of the tunnels have metal bars so I'll need someone who's good at bending. Leela, how 'bout you?"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela, Sure. I'll do it.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender, Like hell you will! Bending's my middle name.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, It is?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender, Yep. My full name is Bender Bending Rodríguez.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," Here's the entrance. [He steps onto the ladder in the manhole.] From this moment on, I declare my bad luck officially over."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender, He was fun.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela," Well, if we get bored looking for the clover, I've got Tetris on this thing."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," Look, up ahead."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender, Old New York  The city that inspired a casino in Las Vegas.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," Wow! We've got Manhattan all to ourselves! I can finally do all the crazy stuff I always dreamed of doing. [He stands on top of a newspaper box.] [shouting] Howard Stern is overrated! [He laughs and runs to a phone box and deliberately knocks the receiver off.] Uh, oops!"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender, New York is so burned.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, And remember when Mayor Giuliani cracked down on jaywalking?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela, No.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," Well, Rudy, how do you like this action?"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Teen #1," As you know, the big breakdance is Saturday. So if we wanna win those Jam Master J autographed parachute pants, our crew has to pop, lock and bust the freshest. Noticeably F.A.T., drop us a beat. [Noticeably F.A.T. makes beat box noises. Fry steps up.] Name?"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, Cosmic F.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Teen #1, Style?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, Outer space.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Teen #1, Special moves?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, [dancing] The moonwalk ... the robot ... the zero G.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Teen #1, Name?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy, Cosmic Y.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Teen #1, Style?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy," Uh, deep space!"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, Deep space?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Teen #1, Special moves?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy, The spacewalk...
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, Hey!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy, The robot...
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, The robot? That's similar to mine!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy, The zero G.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, What are you doing? You totally ripped off my routine.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy, You callin' me a biter?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," Why do you always have to steal everything from me, Yancy? Find your own life and live it."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy, Stop illin'! Word!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, Well I'd like to see you try and steal this. The septuple-head-spin.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy, He's just scratching. No one's ever done more than a quadruple.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," Oh, yeah? Noticeably F.A.T., rewind the tape."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Teen #1, Crazy sucker!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Teen #2," Phil, you're hot!"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Noticeably F.A.T.," That was ice cold, bro!"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Teen #1," Fry, if I ever see you try anything that crazy again, this crew might just have some new parachute pants!"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy, Stop hogging the clover.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," Alright, team, let's go find that clover!"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela, Which way to your house? The sign says we're at 71st Street.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," 71st Street? Hmm, never heard of it. Downtown could be in any direction."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender, No sweat. We'll just take a spin on the B-train!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender, Ooh! That feels funny! [Fry and Leela climb onto him and he gets an intercom out of his chest cabinet and speaks into it.] This is the Brooklyn-bound B-train making local stops at wherever the hell I feel like. Watch for the closing doors.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender," Wake up, buddy. End of the line!"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," Gosh! My old neighbourhood. [They walk down a deserted street and Fry points at things.] That's the bench where I found some shirts! That fire hydrant! In summer we'd light it on fire! On that corner, some guy with a bushy beard handed out a socialist newsletter!"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender, Was it poorly Xeroxed?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, You'd better believe it!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela," The old comedians were right, this place is a lot different from L.A."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mutant," Pardon me, but did I overhear you saying you used to live here?"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, That's right.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mutant, Did you know Andy Goldman?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," Yeah, he was my neighbour. Why?"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mutant, I mutated from him!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, Get outta here! What's Andy up to these days?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Andy, The short answer is I'm teaching.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela, He seemed nice.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, Sure. When he's sober!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, Holy camolies! The house I grew up in. It's still there!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender," Man, Father Time really took a bat to this place."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy, That stupid clover is a worthless piece of garbage! Give it! Give it! Give it!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, [shouting; from outside] Mom! Help!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mrs. Fry, Yes!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," Mom, Yancy's trying to steal my clover."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mrs. Fry," [uninterested] Yancy, stealing is wrong."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy," Come back here, you! I'm gonna pile drive you! [Fry runs into the basement and locks the door behind him.] You're dead meat!"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mr. Fry, What's happenin' up there? Did Kremlin Joe let fly with the nukes?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," Not yet, commander. Yancy's just trying to steal my stuff as usual."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mr. Fry, Well he'd better keep his hands off these bananas. Gonna need them when the radiation turns us all into monkeys.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," The Ronco Record Vault! Yancy'll never get his hands on you in here or my money back. [He opens the vault, flips through some records and takes one out.] Ah, The Breakfast Club soundtrack. Man, I can't wait till I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff. [He slips the clover into the record sleeve and puts it back into the vault and closes it.] Stay safe, clover. I may need you again someday."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, This was the storage room. My dad spent years turning it into a bomb shelter.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela, And yet you guys never had a single nuclear war.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender, What a waste.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, This is it. My Ronco Record Vault. [He blows the dust off it.] I still remember the combination  Three. [He turns the dial and tries to open the door.] It's stuck!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender," The Achilles heel of the Ronco design is its structural resonance frequency. Allow me. [He cracks his knuckles, puts his hand on the top of the vault and starts vibrating it. The room starts to shake around them, plaster falls from the ceiling and furniture shakes. Leela looks around. Bender's head vibrates right off his body and lands on the floor. The vault door opens.] There we go!"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, Here it is. The Breakfast Club soundtrack.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender," You mean ""breakfast club sandwich""?"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, I hid my seven-leaf clover in this very record jacket so my brother Yancy wouldn't get it. [He takes a deep breath.] Here goes. [He reaches into the sleeve.] It's gone! [He takes the record out and sticks his head into the sleeve.] The whole place has been cleaned out! Yancy stole my clover! That thief!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela, How do you know it didn't disintegrate?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, Everything else in here held up OK.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender, Except Sports by Huey Lewis.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, I don't know why my brother hated me so much.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela," Oh, brothers always fight. I'm sure deep down he loved you. He just never got a chance to say it before you got frozen."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, You think? 'Cause I always kinda wished that--
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender, Who is that God-like figure?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," It's my brother, Yancy! And there, in his lapel, my seven-leaf clover! I knew he stole it."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela," Hold the phone. If that's Yancy, why does the inscription say Philip J. Fry?"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, Wait a second. That's my name! Good Lord. He ditched his goofy name and stole mine!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender," Apparently this brave Adonis, this Cadillac of men, was the first person on Mars."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," First person on Mars? I should have been the first person on Mars. He stole my clover, he stole my name and he stole my life. [He punches the statue.] And now he broke my hand!"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender, His legend lives on.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Farnsworth, So you opened the record vault and the clover was gone?
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender, Yep. Nothing in there but all the best music of the 1980's in one amazing collection.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela," Survivor, Pat Benatar, The Scorpions. The list goes on."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, That clover helped my ratfink brother steal my dream of going into space. Now I'll never get there.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela, You went there this morning for doughnuts.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Hermes," First person on Mars? Oh, so your brother was that Philip J. Fry."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, I'm Philip J. Fry! He stole my name after I got frozen.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Farnsworth," Shut up, friends. My Internet browser heard us saying the word ""Fry"" and it found a movie about Philip J. Fry for us. [The staff gather around.] It also opened my calendar to Friday and ordered me some French fries."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Narrator," [voice-over; in movie] Philip J. Fry  Astronaut, philanthropist, entrepreneur was a great man truly worthy of narration. Fry was the first man on Mars ... [The scene changes to a man planting the American flag on Mars.] ... a feat that has never since been equalled."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, That should have been me!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Narrator, [voice-over; in movie] The ever-lucky Fry made his fortune after striking oil in the bathroom of the mansion he had won in a lottery.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, That's my clover! Yancy stole it!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Narrator," [voice-over; in movie] After a whirlwind fling with Icelandic supermodel Njörd, Fry scored a string of top 10 hits with his rock band Leaf Seven, known for their hypnotic rhythms, driving baselines and memorable hooks."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, That's what I'm known for!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Man," [in movie] Phil came in, right, strummed out this tune, yeah, and I said, ""That's a number one record!"""
The Luck of the Fryrish,Narrator," [voice-over; in movie] Today, Fry spends most of his time in his grave in Orbiting Meadows National Cemetery, buried with the trademark seven-leaf clover that will bring him luck in the next life, perhaps some Egyptians believe."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," So that's where my clover is? Hey, is that orbiting cemetery near here?"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela, It will be in a couple hours.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," Good. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender, I'll get my kit.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy," Thanks for lending me your tux, Dad. It'll be perfect for my wedding."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mr. Fry," Yancy, that tux got me through 'Nam in style. [He sighs.] I just wish your brother were still around to see this."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mrs. Fry," I'll never forget the day Philip disappeared. Wisconsin won the Rose Bowl 17-9. Oh, I miss him."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy," Oh, that reminds me  I was thinking I'd rummage through Phil's records for something to play at the wedding."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Mrs. Fry, Have a look downstairs. Your brother may be missing but his crap sure isn't.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy," Hmm, Breakfast Club. This'll clear out the room at the end of the reception."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela, They buried your brother in the World Heroes section? I'm impressed.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, I should be the one in that grave!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, Hmm. We lost Bender.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender, There! Now no one will be able to say I don't own John Larroquette's spine.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, Aha! My brother's grave!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela," [reading] Philip Fry, the original Martian."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," It's all lies, every word of it! He wasn't original, he wasn't a Martian, he wasn't Philip Fry and since when is he a the?"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender, You're twice the the he ever was.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry, It's clovering time!
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy's wife," So, had any ideas for names, Yancy?"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy," Uh, I'm sorta thinking one. [She hands him the baby.] Daddy has a present for you today. Do you know what it is? [He pulls the clover out of his pocket.] It's a lucky clover that can help you be successful whatever you do -- even breakdancing -- and it once belonged to someone very special."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy's wife, I know what name you wanna give him Yancy. It's OK.
The Luck of the Fryrish,Yancy," Really? [She nods.] Son, I'm naming you Philip J. Fry in honour of my little brother, who I miss every day. I love you, Philip, and I always will."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Fry," [reading] Here lies Philip J. Fry, named for his uncle to carry on his spirit."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender," Pay dirt! I got the clover! Plus his wedding ring. [He puts it on and flashes it around.] Sorry, ladies, I'm taken! Hey, Fry, you want me to smack the corpse up a little?"
The Luck of the Fryrish,Leela," Uh, Bender, I think Fry needs a moment alone."
The Luck of the Fryrish,Bender," Alright, grab a shovel. I'm only one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion."
The Luck of the Fryrish,,
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," Fry, I know those cookies are fresh-a-licious but they produce an awful lot of trash."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender, Ah!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," And, Bender, that aerosol head spray makes your antenna smell nice--"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender, Thank you.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, But it's doing long-term damage to the planet.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender, So? It's not like it's the only one we've got.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! I'm sending you on an extremely controversial mission."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry, Controversial?
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Farnsworth," Oh, my, no."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Farnsworth," For this highly controversial mission you'll be towing the Juan Valdez, an orbiting supertanker full of rich Columbian dark matter."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, Dark matter oil? What if we hit something? The tanker could leak.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Farnsworth," Impossible! [He presses a button and an enlarged holographic cross-section of the tanker appears.] The tanker has 6,000 hulls. So, unlike me, it's entirely leak-proof. [He points at a new hologram with the fing-longer.] Now, once you've hauled the tanker past the protestors--"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, Protestors?
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Farnsworth," Correct. 6,000 hulls."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, Why do we have to fly within three feet of this penguin preserve on Pluto?
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Farnsworth, [whispering] To avoid the tollbooth.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry," OK, she's all restocked with emergency jam. Let's get going."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," At the risk of sounding negative  No! Look, Professor, I can't participate in this mission."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Farnsworth, What are you yapping about?
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," This time it's your reckless disregard for the environment. In fact, I'm gonna go join those protestors."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Farnsworth, This is an outrage! I demand you hand over your captain's jacket.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, This is my normal jacket. I've had it for 10 years.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Farnsworth," I said hand it over! [She takes it off, throws it at him and storms out.] Well, Fry, or should I say Captain Fry? [He holds the jacket out to him then pulls it away.] No, I shouldn't. Because Bender is the new captain!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry, Bender?
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Farnsworth," That's right. Being captain is about intuition and heart. A good captain can't have either one. That's why cold, logical Bender is perfect for the job."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," Well, I do think of human life as expendable."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry, No fair! Leela was training me to be captain. She even let me sit in her lap and steer -- in this comic I drew.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Zoidberg, Ooh! The new one's out!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," Fry, the title of captain may inflate the human ego, but it's beneath the notice of my mighty robo-logic. [He puts a blue Napoleon-like hat on and stands up.] Now look spry, men! We launch at six bells!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr.," Greetings, Econauts. I'm Free Waterfall Sr., founder of Penguins Unlimited. [The crowd applauds.] Whoa! No, no! No applause. Every time you clap your hands you kill thousands of spores that'll some day form a nutritious fungus. Just show your approval with a mould-friendly thumbs up. [The crowd thumbs-ups.] Please hold your thumbs until the end. Now, folks, it's time to stop that tanker with a non-violent human circle."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, [standing up] Why do we have to resort to non-violence? Can't we just kick their asses?
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr.," Now, little lady, those people's asses are living things too."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," Aye! We're hitched up tighter than Davy Jones' U-Haul! At ease, men."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry, I am at ease.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," Mr. Fry, I like to give my first mate an informal nickname. From now on you will be known as ... Wiggles!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry, The hell I will! Have you even read the Captain's Handbook?
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender, I have now. And what's Peter Parrot's first rule of captaining?
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry, Always respect the chain o' command ... captain.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," Correct, Wiggles. You've just earned an invitation to the captain's table"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Zoidberg, [whispering] The captain's table! What an honour!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr., Our peace ring has 'em trapped like a tiger in a washing machine!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, Get ready!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Protestor #1, Look out!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Protestor #2, Hold on!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr., Here they come!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," When you were planning this peace ring, didn't you realise spaceships can move in three dimensions?"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr.," No, I did not."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr.," Folks, that tanker gave us the slip, but we'll stop 'em here on Pluto. If you're cold, rub your bodies with permafrost. It's nature's long johns. [He picks up some snow, puts his hand down his trousers and rubs it around.] If rubbing frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey, I don't wanna be right!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr., This here is our penguin preserve.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, Aw! They're so cute! They're like if puppies and kittens could have babies!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr., We use hand puppets around the young'uns to simulate a natural environment.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, That's adorable!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," But I suppose it's this medal I'm most proud of, Wiggles. I won it for saving the children of Earth from a giant kangaroo. It was on the Australian news, you probably didn't see it."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Zoidberg, Brilliant!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry," Would you cram a sock in it, Bender? Those aren't even medals, they're bottle-caps and pepperoni slices!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," Thank you, steward. Wiggles, weren't you about to propose a toast to your gallant captain?"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry," Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender, he's the best ... [Bender swirls his glass around.] ... at being a big jerk who's stupid and his big, ugly face is as dumb as a butt."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," Eh, I've heard better."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry, If I were in charge I wouldn't treat you like this. You're nothing but a big blowhard.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," Sir, you forget yourself! Shut up!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry, Being captain is obviously more important to you than being my friend. I'm going.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender, Going? But a captain can't drink without his first mate.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Zoidberg, You can drink with me maybe?
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender, I don't feel like drinking.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Zoidberg," Then, if you'll excuse me, I see some ravioli that only has two shoe prints on it. [Bender walks through it.] Three."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," [singing] Oh, Greenland is a barren land,"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,"A land that bears no green,",
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,"Where there's ice and snow,",
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,"And the whale fishes blow,",
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,And the--,
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Zoidberg," Captain, please, have some liquor. You robots need alcohol to function."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender, [sober] Gah! I once knew a guy ... you look like him. But he wasn't either. [His hat tumbles off and he groans.] I'm a good captain.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Zoidberg," Please, sir, I love you like a father!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Protestor #3," Here they come. Oh, I hope they read my sign!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, Bender's flying too low! And he's upside-down!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Protestor #3, He must be talking on a cell phone!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry, What's happening?
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Zoidberg," All 6,000 hulls have been breached!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry," Oh, the fools! If only they'd built it with 6,001 hulls! When will they learn?"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Linda, [solemn; on TV] Continuing our coverage of a tragic [upbeat] but far away [solemn] story. The crisis on Pluto worsens as dark matter spreads throughout the penguin habitat. The images are truly horrific.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," [on TV] I don't think any of us can understand how those poor, oil-drenched penguins feel."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Morbo," [on TV] Oily humanoid! [Linda chuckles.] At the time of the crash, the tanker captain had an alcohol level of .08 percent -- well below the legal limit for robots."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Hyper-Chicken," Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal  Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just got me the death penalty?"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Hyper-Chicken, I'd have done better but it's plum hard pleadin' a case while awaitin' trial for that there incompetence!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," Yeah, uh, good luck with that."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, Now you stay away from those puffin twins.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr.," Good way to avoid frostbite, folks  Put your hands between your buttocks. That's nature's pocket."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, Uh ... I think I'll go check on Bender.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr., Watch that he doesn't pick your pocket.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," Ah, can't beat fresh-squeezed!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," Bender, can you at least pretend you're being punished? [She runs her finger over a penguin's black feathers.] And clean the black parts too."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Smitty, Are they black with white feathers or white with black feathers?
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,URL," It don't matter, baby, they're all beautiful!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," Yo, screws, more Tegrin over here? [He sees them hugging.] Oh, ho! What's this?"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,URL," Aw, man! He got away!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Smitty, I guess this is why Chief says no hugging.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr.," Good work, everyone. I suggest you all go get some sleep. Me, well, I'm gonna stay up all night singing songs about penguins in a fine, piercing tenor."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," Has anyone seen Bender? [shouting] Bender? [She pats her knee.] Here robot, robot, robot."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," Hey, why weren't you Kong donkeys outside cleaning up?"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Zoidberg, They sent us inside for doing an unsatisfactory job. [Yolk drips from his mouth.] [ashamed] And eating penguin eggs.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry," You ate most of them. So, where's Captain Bender? Off catastrophising some other planet?"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Zoidberg," Damnit, Fry! He may have done wrong, but he's still your captain."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, I'm worried about him. He didn't come back with the group.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry, He didn't?
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," No, and with wind-chill it's 20 degrees below absolute zero. I'd better go find him."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry," Wait. Let me. Bender and I have our disagreements, but we're still friends and I'm gonna show him what that means. [He puts on Leela's jacket and Bender's hat.] To the ship."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, Why don't you just walk? He was only about 20 yards from here.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry," Madam, I am in command now."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Zoidberg," Such a man! I'd follow him to hell and back, I would."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," What the--? [The penguins and he dive into some water. Bender comes up to the surface.] What's this water made of, ice? Forget this!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Penguin #1, [in penguin] Full of fish?
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender, [in penguin] Not entirely.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Penguin #1, [in penguin] Then let's fish.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Zoidberg," Captain, I don't think we're on Pluto any longer. In fact, we may have left space as we know it."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry, Then where are we? You said you knew how to navigate.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Zoidberg, [shouting] Stop yelling at me!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr.," Folks, it's worse than we thought. Seems dark matter is nature's sex drug. It's like a perverted trail mix of penguin oestrogen, penguin Viagra and Spanish penguin fly. Why, it's making them ultra-fertile."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, How ultra?
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr.," Well your garden variety penguin lays one egg a year. Since the spill our penguins have been laying six eggs every 15 minutes. [The hippies gasp.] Also, the eggs hatch in only 12 hours. [The hippies gasp again.] Also, the males are laying eggs."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Doctor, This man is over-gasped.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr., If the birds keep multiplying there'll soon be too many to count. [Behind him a video clip of a skinny penguin appears.] Before long the penguins will exhaust their food supply and starve to death.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," Oh, if only we hadn't flown penguins to Pluto and dumped oil on them, this might never have happened. Can't we stop them from multiplying?"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr.," Yes, I reckon it is our responsibility. And thankfully we have a plan."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, What is it? We'll do anything.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr.," Everyone, grab your guns. I declare penguin hunting season officially open."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, You can't shoot penguins. Isn't there some way to keep them from breeding?
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr.," Cold showers don't work on Antarctic creatures. Now surely you agree that a quick, semi-painless death is a damn sight better than weeks of starvation."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," Well, I suppose... But-- I mean-- I joined Penguins Unlimited to love penguins, not to hunt them."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr., This time the two are one and the same! Now are you with us or are you gonna let innocent penguins suffer?
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," [crying] Oh, God! It's inhuman! It's like Hong Kong! I'll do it!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr., That's a good old-fashioned gun. Simple point-and-click interface. Rifle check!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Hunter #1," Oh, yeah!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Hunter #2, Wee doggy!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," Hey, you're enjoying this."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr.," Look, nobody enjoys shooting penguins. But if you have to shoot penguins, well, you might as well enjoy it."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," I'm sorry, but if it's fun in any way it's not environmentalism."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr.," Oh, really? How 'bout blowing up dams?"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, Yeah ... that is fun.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr., Let's conservate!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Zoidberg," [shouting; from ship] It's been an honour to serve under you, sir!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," Alright, this is for their own good. Don't leave orphans. Gotta kill entire families. [She looks down the gunsight.] But they're so cute. No! You can do this. It's just like murdering a little butler. I-I can't look. [She shakes as she starts to squeeze the trigger. A tear streams down her face. She shoots and the penguins squawk and run away.] [crying] Oh, no! What have I done? [She runs down the hillside. The penguins are gathered around a dead penguin. Leela falls to her knees and cries.] Oh, you poor little guy! I'm so sorry I-- Bender? [Bender opens his eyes and resets to Human Mode. He loads the human language and brings up his task list. 1] Bend. 2] Cheese It! He stands up and takes the bullet out of his head. Leela stops crying.] What's going on? Were you hiding out with these little guys?"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender, Of course not. Filthy ice rats! Scat! Shoo! [The penguins rub against him.] Gah! What are you doing? Get away!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, Aw! They love you!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," Well I don't love them. [A baby penguin looks up at him and cheeps.] Aw! [He regurgitates some food into it's mouth. Leela looks away.] I don't know why but when I look down at their little faces, it makes me wanna puke! In a good way!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Penguins, [in penguin] Stand still. It's our only hope.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender, [in penguin] That's puffin talk. Now follow me!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," Stop! Stop shooting! It's me, Leela."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Hunter #2, Sorry.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr.," Why aren't you firing randomly into those birds, little lady? Don't you wanna help 'em?"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, Not this way.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr., What? Why you're not a tree-hugging kook at all!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," Look, I don't know if shooting penguins will help the environment or not. But I do know the decision shouldn't be in the hands of people who just wanna kill for fun."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr.," Leela, you may just be farming some free-range truth there. [Leela smiles.] On the other hand, we already made up 200 pounds of batter for penguin tempura. OK, boys, it's them or us!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, No!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr., Hey! Where'd they--
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender, [shouting] Attack!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Hunter #1, Whoa!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Hunter #2, Ow!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender, [in penguin] We will fight them on the beaches! We will fight them on the glaciers!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Waterfall Sr., [shouting] Make sure they use every part of my body!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Old Man Waterfall," [shouting] I'll avenge your death, son!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, They used to be such peaceful birds. I suppose this was your doing.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," Yep. It's like I taught 'em  If it ain't black and white, peck scratch and bite! Now to take off my tuxedo. [He takes it off and puts it in his chest cabinet. The penguins turn away from Waterfall and move towards Leela and Bender.] Guys, it's me! Your lovable dictator! Uh-oh!"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," Oh, if only we had a toboggan."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender, Faster! Faster!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, Phew!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," Oh, phew! [The penguins dive into the water and swim towards the ice block.] Oh, right, they can swim. It's all coming back to me now."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela, It's Fry!
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender, Wiggles?
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," Well, at least it'll help reduce their population."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," Yeah, life is hilariously cruel. [He laughs then slips over and slides down towards the open mouth of the whale. The cargo bay lift comes down and Fry grabs Bender's hand.] Permission to come aboard, Wiggles?"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry, Granted. We can't take off without our captain.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," Oh, and bring my toboggan."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry," So, Leela, were you able to help the penguins?"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Leela," Well, sure. I mean ... not really. I mean ... nature will work itself out. It can't screw things up any worse than we did trying to fix things, right?"
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Fry, [mumbling] I 'unno.
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,Bender," Ah, quit your worrying. Thanks to my shining influence those stupid birds'll do just fine."
The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz,,
Bendless Love,Leela, Guidance system?
Bendless Love,Bender, Online.
Bendless Love,Leela, Autopilot?
Bendless Love,Autopilot, Present.
Bendless Love,Leela, Dark matter indicator?
Bendless Love,Fry, Making the noise.
Bendless Love,Leela, All systems operational. Let's rock!
Bendless Love,Leela," Gentlemen, I've completed my report on the crash."
Bendless Love,Bender, Whoa! I'm not reading that crap. Summarise it in one word.
Bendless Love,Leela," Sabotage. [Gasps all around. Leela points to an L-shaped piece of metal on the table.] This is a normal L-unit. Without it, space travel is but the fevered dream of a madman."
Bendless Love,Fry, Yep.
Bendless Love,Bender, Of course.
Bendless Love,Zoidberg, Doy!
Bendless Love,Hermes, It's an important unit.
Bendless Love,Leela," And this, my friends, is the L-unit I just removed from the ship."
Bendless Love,Fry," That doesn't look like an ""L"" at all. Unless you count lowercase."
Bendless Love,Bender, You know we don't!
Bendless Love,Leela, Whoever did this was strong. This is 340 pounds of Tonka-tough steel.
Bendless Love,Bender, Hmm. It should look like this. [He bends it into an L-shape.] But instead it looks like this.
Bendless Love,Fry, Who would do a thing like that?
Bendless Love,Bender," Who could do a thing like that? And by ""that"", I mean this."
Bendless Love,Zoidberg," Well, gang, it looks like we have another mystery on our hands."
Bendless Love,Hermes, I'd better make a chart of the suspects. I'll begin by drawing a line with my straight-edge. [He draws along his straight-edge but halfway along the line starts to bend. He gasps.] Sweet lamprey of Santa Fe! My edge has been bent!
Bendless Love,Amy, [crying] My javelin too! It's ruined. [She holds up her javelin which has been bent in eight places.] Now we'll never beat Jupiter State.
Bendless Love,Zoidberg," My slinky! [He runs over to the corner of the room and picks up a straightened slinky. He falls to his knees.] My cuddly, little pet slinky!"
Bendless Love,Farnsworth, What's all the hubbub?
Bendless Love,Leela, My God! Even the Professor's been bent.
Bendless Love,Farnsworth," That you for your sympathy, talking square of linoleum."
Bendless Love,Bender, I'll get you fixed up. [He bends Farnsworth backwards so his face is pointing upwards. Farnsworth screams.] That's fine.
Bendless Love,Amy," Wait a minute. Bender, what did you just do to the Professor?"
Bendless Love,Bender, I bent him.
Bendless Love,Amy, Aha!
Bendless Love,Hermes, Bender!
Bendless Love,Zoidberg, J'accuse!
Bendless Love,Bender," Oh, I see. A bunch of stuff gets bent so it must be the robot designed for bending."
Bendless Love,Hermes, I know how to settle this  We'll check last night's surveillance tapes.
Bendless Love,Fry, Huh?
Bendless Love,Amy, What tapes?
Bendless Love,Leela, Surveillance?
Bendless Love,Zoidberg, You've seen me naked?
Bendless Love,Hermes, Ah. Last night's tape. It was right next to Bathroom Bloopers 4.
Bendless Love,Bender," See? Nothing. Told you, losers."
Bendless Love,Fry, Wait! There on the screen. It's that guy you are.
Bendless Love,Bender, I'm sleepwalking.
Bendless Love,Farnsworth, Dear God! We've got robots on the ceiling.
Bendless Love,Fry," You weren't sleepwalking, you were sleep-bending!"
Bendless Love,Bender," This is quite a shock. On the other hand, it's not surprising in the least. After all, I've been bending since the day I was built."
Bendless Love,Bender, [voice-over] I was born on an assembly line in the bad part of Tijuana.
Bendless Love,Bender," Mama. [He reaches out and cries. The robotic arm opens a bottle of Olde Fortran and screws a baby bottle-top onto it and feeds Bender. The conveyor belt moves and carries Bender to a machine marked ""Bending School"". Another robot arm comes out of it and installs bending software into his head. A third one hands him a diploma and puts a hat on his head then it throws the hat in the air.] Hooray! I graduated! Time to bend around Europe for a few months, then get a job bending."
Bendless Love,Amy, You remember your own birth?
Bendless Love,Bender, Sure. It was only four years ago.
Bendless Love,Fry, You're only four years old?
Bendless Love,Bender," Precocious little scamp, ain't I?"
Bendless Love,Leela, Hmm. Bender must have a pent-up need to bend that's not being satisfied by his bend-free lifestyle.
Bendless Love,Farnsworth, Then he can't stay here. He's a menace to every straight person in the company. [Bender hangs his head in shame.] Go satisfy your bend lust and don't you come back to work until you do.
Bendless Love,Robots," [chanting] No more bending, no more work. Give us a raise, you big fat jerk."
Bendless Love,Sal, [shouting] Nevers!
Bendless Love,Joey, Yo! The Mafia supports you. But don't tell no one. Spread the word.
Bendless Love,Donbot," As the duly-elected mobsters of this union, it's our duty to support the struggle of these proud, lazy slobs."
Bendless Love,Joey," Yeah, but what if management remains intragnizent?"
Bendless Love,Donbot," From the context it is clear what you mean. In that case, Clamps may have a little surprise for them."
Bendless Love,Clamps, The clamps! [He clacks his clamps then turns to the Donbot.] [unsure] Right?
Bendless Love,Bender," Aw, no! A strike? Now I'll never get to bend anything. Oh, woe is Bender."
Bendless Love,Robot #1," Hang tough, brother. Management refused our demand to switch casual Friday to Monday."
Bendless Love,Bender, What?
Bendless Love,Robot #2, And now they're hiring scabs at ten-times the normal wage.
Bendless Love,Bender, Ten-times normal wage? [He rolls his sleeves up.] I'll give those jerks what for!
Bendless Love,Sal," Welcomes aboard, scab."
Bendless Love,Bender, Great to be here.
Bendless Love,Sal, Come on. I'll introduces you to your scab co-workers you'll be scabbing with. [He points to a bending unit.] This here's our scab foreman.
Bendless Love,Bender, Flexo?
Bendless Love,Flexo, Bender?
Bendless Love,Bender," Hey, sorry you got sent to that South American Turkish prison instead of me on account of mistaken identity."
Bendless Love,Flexo," You bastard! They treated me like an animal and that's what I became! [He laughs.] Nah, you're alright. Good to see you, buddy!"
Bendless Love,Sal," And here's another scab what also works here, Angle-ine."
Bendless Love,Bender, [sexfully] Hello.
Bendless Love,Sal," Hey, yous guyses wanna move that things?"
Bendless Love,Bender, [more sexfully] Hello!
Bendless Love,Robots," [chanting] Give us a raise, you big fat jerk."
Bendless Love,Sal, [from outside] Nevers!
Bendless Love,Bender," Ow! [He strolls over to Angle-ine.] Um, hi, Angle-ine. Whatcha up to?"
Bendless Love,Angle-ine, Making hangers. Guidance counsellor said I had a knack for it.
Bendless Love,Bender," That's cool, that's cool. So, um, uh, I was wondering if, y'know, it's cool if not, but, what are you doing after work?"
Bendless Love,Angle-ine, What I always do. Jack squat.
Bendless Love,Bender," Me too. [He chuckles again.] Man, we have a lot in common, huh?"
Bendless Love,Angle-ine, Well we are made of virtually identical components.
Bendless Love,Bender, [sexfully] Are you sure? Maybe I should sneak a peek at your access panel.
Bendless Love,Angle-ine," Hey, according to the scab handbook that's extremely inappropriate banter. [sexfully] And that's just the way I like it."
Bendless Love,Hermes, Haile H. Selassie!
Bendless Love,Zoidberg," There, little friend. Good as new."
Bendless Love,Farnsworth," What an exquisite day. That azure sky, the verdant treetops. [Behind him the crack addict exchanges money for crack with a dealer.] Those delightful birds with their chirp, chirp, chirp and their tweet, tweet, splat."
Bendless Love,Fry," Professor, I've never seen you so cheerful. What the hell's wrong with you?"
Bendless Love,Farnsworth," Hmm. I'm not quite sure. Perhaps seeing things from a new perspective has reminded me of life's beauty. Or perhaps my new posture is causing blood to pool in the back of my brain, resulting in a mild delirium. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose."
Bendless Love,Fry, I wish! It's a nickel.
Bendless Love,Bender, Union forever! Lousy scabs! They can't do those things! Et cetera!
Bendless Love,Bender, I bet watching me bend girders like this turns your legs all rubbery.
Bendless Love,Angle-ine," Well my legs are made of rubber. [She turns around.] And anyway, I am just as strong as you are, Mac."
Bendless Love,Bender," Oh, yeah? [A girder drops into his hands and he holds it out to Angle-ine.] Prove it. [She takes it and grunts as she tries to bend it. First she tries just with her hands then she puts it across her leg and tries and then she gives in and sighs. Bender stands behind her.] Here, let me help you."
Bendless Love,Farnsworth, My new bent outlook has completely re-energised me. I'm even dating a young Brazilian retired actress.
Bendless Love,Fry, Alright!
Bendless Love,Farnsworth, Some say I'm robbing the cradle but I say she's robbing the grave.
Bendless Love,Bender," Howdy, doodies. What's new?"
Bendless Love,Farnsworth," I was just regaling your former co-workers with a tale of bedroom antics, the likes of which--"
Bendless Love,Bender," Yeah, yeah! Big whoop! No one cares. I got Bender-related news. I'm in love and I'm taking all my friends out to celebrate."
Bendless Love,Amy, Let's get liquored up!
Bendless Love,Elzar," Hey, look at this crowd. You guys gotta try the pasta. It's got a real nice profit margin. Bam! So, special occasion tonight?"
Bendless Love,Bender," Oh, Elzar, you'll never guess what's happened?"
Bendless Love,Elzar, Bam?
Bendless Love,Bender, I met the most dynamite ladybot.
Bendless Love,Elzar," Hey, that's terrific. To celebrate, I'm gonna stick seven copies of my latest cookbook on your bill."
Bendless Love,Bender," Bless you, sir."
Bendless Love,Farnsworth," So, Bender, tell us about this new girlfriend of yours."
Bendless Love,Bender," I intend to. Through the lost art of the toast. [He stands and raises his glass.] To Angle-ine, she's got it all. Looks, charm and the love of a fabulous bending robot."
Bendless Love,Fry, She sure does.
Bendless Love,Bender, Flexo!
Bendless Love,Elzar," [shouting] Careful, that's a week old!"
Bendless Love,Bender," I finally meet a nice girl with a pair of legs that don't quit unexpectedly and that jerk Flexo steals her away? It's time to kick some shiny, metal ass. [He walks over to their table.] You degenerate hussy! I'm disappointed in you too, Angle-ine."
Bendless Love,Angle-ine," Bender, it's-it's not what you think."
Bendless Love,Bender," Oh, God! Then it's worse than I think."
Bendless Love,Angle-ine," Now, look, there is no reason to be upset. Flexo and I are divorced."
Bendless Love,Bender, Div-- Huh?
Bendless Love,Flexo, We're just havin' dinner 'cause we wanna stay friends.
Bendless Love,Bender," Uh, I knew that. What I'm actually outraged by is your choice of wine. Really, it's the steward's fault."
Bendless Love,Steward," Excellent choice, sir."
Bendless Love,Bender," [muttering] That Flexo, I'm knockin' him right on his butt. I can't believe this."
Bendless Love,Farnsworth," Obsessing won't help, Bender. Take a lean back and enjoy life."
Bendless Love,Bender, I can't. My Fembot may be in love with another Manbot.
Bendless Love,Leela, Well talk to her. Tell her about your feelings in an open an honest way.
Bendless Love,Fry, Yeah. Either that or be a man.
Bendless Love,Bender," OK, I've constructed an elaborate lie  I'll call Angle-ine while pretending to be Flexo, arrange a date, show up disguised as him and catch her two-timing me with myself."
Bendless Love,Fry, That's thinkin' like a man.
Bendless Love,Bender, [disguised voice] Hello? This is Flexo.
Bendless Love,Bender, Now we'll see who loves whom.
Bendless Love,Bender," Hey, hot stuff."
Bendless Love,Angle-ine," Hey, Flexo. [She hugs him.] So since when do you go to bars on work nights? It's not like you at all."
Bendless Love,Bender," Nonsense. It's exactly like me. Flexo  The fun-loving love machine Fembots love to love. Hey, barkeep, I'll have a Fuzzy Navel and she'll have the girliest drink in the house."
Bendless Love,Bartender-bot, Two Fuzzy Navel's comin' up.
Bendless Love,Bender, I hope they can make change for a fortune.
Bendless Love,Joey," Yo. Get an eye-load of that filthy scab with the beard flashing his filthy scab money. It's an insult to you, boss."
Bendless Love,Donbot, Yeah. That cash oughta be slushin' my fund and kicksing my back.
Bendless Love,Clamps, I'm greasing up my whoozits!
Bendless Love,Donbot," Whoa, whoa, Clamps, not yet. Let's just keep an eye on him and see if he does it a couple more times."
Bendless Love,Bender, You're lookin' good to Flexo tonight.
Bendless Love,Angle-ine, Quit makin' with the googly eyes. You know that I'm in love with Bender.
Bendless Love,Bender, Bender? That walking wuss factory?
Bendless Love,Angle-ine," Well he may be a walking factory but believe me he is no wuss. Now, look, you and me are through. I told you that when I divorced you."
Bendless Love,Bender," But going through a divorce together, you can't tell me that didn't bring us closer. Care to dance?"
Bendless Love,Angle-ine, You know I love dancing but you always hated it.
Bendless Love,Bender," In that case it's something I've always wanted to make up to you. [He puts his hand on hers. On the dancefloor he talks to the DJ-bot.] Hey, scratchmo. How 'bout dropping me and the lady some rump-rattling beats?"
Bendless Love,Donbot, I had hoped that by the second time he flashed his cash my rage would have subsided. Sadly that has not happened.
Bendless Love,Angle-ine," You used to be so inflexible, Flexo. You have really loosened up!"
Bendless Love,Bender, I recently upgraded my funk card. C'mon!
Bendless Love,Angle-ine, Alright!
Bendless Love,Bender," C'mon now, what's new! [His goatee flies off his face and lands on a fat Fembot's behind. Bender carefully removes it.] Ew!"
Bendless Love,Angle-ine, Flexo? What-What's going on?
Bendless Love,Bender, Um...
Bendless Love,Angle-ine, Flexo!
Bendless Love,Bender," So the moral of the story is  If you want it to stay sunk, tie a weight to it!"
Bendless Love,Angle-ine," [laughing] You always were a kick in the teeth, man."
Bendless Love,Bender," Aw, shucks, thunder-buns! You make me feel like a million volts."
Bendless Love,Angle-ine," Flexo, Flexo, Flexo. I'm starting to remember why I fell for you in the first place."
Bendless Love,Bender," [thinking] So, she's falling for Flexo, eh? I'd better seduce her a little more, just to be sure."
Bendless Love,Angle-ine," Well, it's late. I should get home to my trailer."
Bendless Love,Bender," I'll walk you out. After all, a true gentleman tends to his date's every need. [He takes a cigar out of his chest cabinet.] Tiparillo?"
Bendless Love,Bender," Here you are, my lad. Bring the lady's car around in the finest way possible."
Bendless Love,Joey, He's flashin' his cash loaf again.
Bendless Love,Donbot, How many times is that? Two or three?
Bendless Love,Clamps, Three.
Bendless Love,Donbot, Alright. That's the necessary number of times. That scab's gonna have a little on-the-job accident.
Bendless Love,Joey," With all due respect, Donbot, I don't think we should rely on an accident happening. Let's kill him ourselves."
Bendless Love,'Angle-ine," Well, goodnight. I-I had a great time."
Bendless Love,Bender, How 'bout a lift? To your place.
Bendless Love,Angle-ine, What?
Bendless Love,Bender," Admit it. You felt something for me tonight. And by ""me"" I mean Flexo."
Bendless Love,'Angle-ine," Hey, look, I had fun, but--"
Bendless Love,Bender, But?
Bendless Love,'Angle-ine, But--
Bendless Love,Bender, But?
Bendless Love,Angle-ine, [gasping] But... [They kiss. They pull their heads away and Bender sees his goatee has stuck to her face. She pulls it off.] Huh? Bender! You tricked me.
Bendless Love,Bender," That's right, baby. I ain't your lover boy, Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anybody pretending to be him."
Bendless Love,Angle-ine, Well maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you're pretending to be.
Bendless Love,Bender," Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now  Kill Flexo. [He punches his knuckles together.] Ow!"
Bendless Love,Angle-ine, [screaming] Nooo!
Bendless Love,Flexo," Thanks, I appreciate that. [He laughs.] Nah, I'm joshing you. That was quite annoying."
Bendless Love,Bender, You call yourself divorced? You're making a mockery of one of our oldest institutions.
Bendless Love,Flexo, What?
Bendless Love,Clamps," Alright, boss, give the word and I'll drop this unbendable girder. Clamp, clamp, ka-bamp!"
Bendless Love,Donbot," Remember, only kill the one with the beard. That other filthy scab we got nothing against."
Bendless Love,Flexo, That's low!
Bendless Love,Angle-ine, Please stop! I'm not worth it!
Bendless Love,Bender, Probably not. But I love you and I'm gonna kick his ass till I win you back.
Bendless Love,Donbot," [from control room] OK, Clamps. Now!"
Bendless Love,Clamps," Ooh, that's gotta clamp!"
Bendless Love,Angle-ine, Flexo? Are you OK?
Bendless Love,Flexo," Yeah, never better. [He coughs up oil.] Nah, I'm yankin' your chain, I'm dying."
Bendless Love,Angle-ine, You can't die. Tonight Bender showed me that I love you.
Bendless Love,Bender," But, I love you."
Bendless Love,Angle-ine, I know and I care for you too. But I could never love anyone as much as you made me realise I love Flexo.
Bendless Love,Bender," But ... but... [He sighs.] I love you so much, Angle-ine, I want you to be happy no matter what."
Bendless Love,Angle-ine," What, what are you saying?"
Bendless Love,Bender, I'm saying I've got an unbendable girder to bend.
Bendless Love,Angle-ine, You can't bend that girder. It's unbendable!
Bendless Love,Bender," Well I don't know anything about lifting, so that just leaves us the one option."
Bendless Love,Flexo," Thanks, buddy. Another year under that and I'd have been a goner."
Bendless Love,Angle-ine," I'll always remember this, Bender."
Bendless Love,Bender, [crying] Me too. Me too. [talking] Jerk.
Bendless Love,Leela," So Flexo and Angle-ine had sex right there on the factory floor? Well, at least you got bending out of your system."
Bendless Love,Bender," Yes. I won't be up to bending again for a long, long time."
Bendless Love,Farnsworth, Perhaps it's your outlook that needs a good bend. A 90-degree bend to a place where happiness is perpendicular to wonderment.
Bendless Love,Fry," Professor, we're all sick of your upbeat attitude."
Bendless Love,Amy, I'll say.
Bendless Love,Zoidberg, Believe it.
Bendless Love,Farnsworth, Nonsense. It's just like in the song I wrote 
Bendless Love,"(singing) We all need a new angle on life,",
Bendless Love,"You gotta bend away all your trouble and your strife,",
Bendless Love,Leela," Bender, you've gotta help us."
Bendless Love,Bender, I try to get out but they keep pulling me back in.
Bendless Love,Farnsworth," [singing] You gotta dangle,"
Bendless Love,"Have a new angle,",
Bendless Love,"Wangle a new dangle on life,",
Bendless Love,Amy," No, Bender! The other way."
Bendless Love,Bender, I like him better this way.
Bendless Love,Farnsworth, I'm sad now.
Bendless Love,Leela," Eh, it's fine."
Bendless Love,,
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Amy, Is Nibbler stoked for the big pet show?
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela," He ought to be with all the strict training I've been putting him through. [She puts Nibbler down and takes a whole joint out of the bag.] Nibbler, roll over and you get a ham. [Nibbler doesn't move.] Roll over. Roll over for the ham. [Nibbler chirps and licks his leg and arm.] You are so adorable! Who wants a ham?"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Farnsworth, Zooka barooka! First prize is $500 and a year's supply of dog food!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Bender," ""$500"", you say?"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Zoidberg," ""Dog food"", you say?"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," Man, that's dog's gonna be hard to beat. Look at him bring in the sheep! One sheep, two sheep ... [He yawns.] ... three sheep."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela," The dog's good, but our real competition is the Hypno-Toad. [The Hypno-Toad is a toad, almost the size of the sheep. It stares at them and it's eyes oscillate and buzz. The sheep walk in single file into the pen and one closes the gate behind it. The judges confer and the Hypno-Toad turns around and hypnotises them. They stare at it, open-mouthed and raise ""10"" cards. The crowd cheers. Leela stands at the side of the ring and puts Nibbler into it.] Your turn, Nibbler, honey. Herd those sheep!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Amy," Come on, Nibbler!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Bender," [to judge] Ma'am, I have a late entry  My hard-shelled wooping terrier, Mr. Zoidberg."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Bender, Faster! Faster.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Zoidberg, Ow!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Bender, Suck in that gut! You wanna be spayed?
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Bender," Silence, you cur! Puff out that brisket!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Bender, I should be weeping! I'm not weeping!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry, I love these things!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela," Shake paws, Nibbler. Come on, shake. [He doesn't.] He might be a little hungry. Shake, boy. Usually he's had more ham by now. Shake!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Judge #1," Third prize, a party-sized keg of guinea pigs, goes to Dave Spiegel and his owner, Fluffers. [A human-sized cat strokes a cat-sized man. The crowd cheers and Fluffers stands on the podium.] Second prize, this lovely afghan made from an Afghan, goes to Bender and his wooping terrier."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Bender, Second place? [He pulls Zoidberg's choke chain.] That's a fancy word for losing. [He whips Zoidberg as he speaks.] You didn't stick your landing!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Zoidberg," Forgive me, my friend."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Bender, Never!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Judge #1," And before we announce the winner we have a special award for a first-time contestant  Ms. Leela and her mystery pet, Nibbler!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, Me? Award? Him? Me? Good?
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Judge #1," That's just the kind of eloquence you'd expect from the owner of Dumbest Pet in Show. [He puts a conical hat on Nibbler with ""Dumb"" written down the middle of it. Everyone laughs.] And the grand prize winner ... [He looks at his notes and adjusts his glasses.] [monotonous] ... the Hypno-Toad. [The Hypno-Toad sits on the podium hypnotising the judge. The Hypno-Toad turns to the crowd and they clap in unison.] All glory to the Hypno-Toad."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, Maybe they're right. Maybe Nibbler is dumb.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," Don't listen to them, Leela. People said I was dumb, but I proved them."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! We were supposed to make a delivery to the planet Tweenis 12 but it's been completely destroyed."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, Why is that good news?
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Farnsworth, They paid in advance.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Bender, Excuse me.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Hermes," This is mighty strange. [He presses a remote control, the lights dim and a holographic display comes up on the table showing a series of planets.] First, the civilisation of Space Rome collapsed, then Don Martin 3 went kaflooie and now Tweenis 12."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry, [pointing] Looks like this planet is next in line.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, That's Earth. [Fry stares blankly.] The planet we live on.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry, I'd hate to be those guys.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Hermes," What's got into him? He's twitching like Zoidberg when someone mentions the word ""food""."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Zoidberg," [twitching] What, now?"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela," [shouting] No! Nibbler, come back!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela," Too bad Nibbler's not around. I guess I'll have to eat this raw, dripping ham by myself. [She sees a blue glow coming from a dumpster at the end of the alley.] Nibbler? [She walks closer to it.] Nibbler, you're scaring me. [The lid flips open and one of the brains comes out. Leela screams. She runs away and it chases her. Two more join it and she rolls under a fence. The brains bump into it. She sees Nibbler at the other end of the alley. He is dressed in a blue flight suit and is pulling a tiny spaceship out of a little shed. She gasps.] Nibbler? [He looks at her and climbs into the spaceship. There is a small hole in the roof for his third eye to go into.] Am I going crazy? Have my years of wild hedonism finally caught up with me? [Nibbler takes off and waves goodbye. The brains fly over the fence and Leela gasps.] [shouting] Nibbler, help! Don't leave me here. [Nibbler lands. Leela hurries into the ship and it blasts off again, knocking the brains out of the way. The ship flies around the Planet Express building and up into space.] Uh, Nibbler? Could you scooch the seat up just a little bit?"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry, Leela back yet?
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Bender," Fry, help me! My heart stopped beating!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry, You don't have a heart; you're a robot.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Bender," Sure ... right. Robot! [He looks at his arms.] Oh, Fry! My skin's all dry and clanky."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," Well, yeah. Robots are made of metal."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Bender, Am I a robot?
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," Bender, if this is some kind of scam, I don't get it. You already have my power of attorney."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Bender, Fry! [He gasps.] My skin!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Farnsworth, Ow. Ow. Ow. [Enter Fry.] I'm a genius. Ow. Ow.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," Dr. Zoidberg, why is everyone acting so weird?"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Zoidberg, Zoidy want balloon! Want balloon now! [He jumps around.] Zoidy want go outside!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry, [angry] I just let you back in!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela," This is unbelievable. I thought you were a furry little moron. But here you are flying an adorable spaceship. If only you could talk. [Nibbler chatters.] Wait! I understood that! [He chatters again.] You say you're transmitting your thoughts directly to my brain. [He says something else.] You say those awful flying brains are making everyone on Earth stupid? [He says something else.] Oh, stupider. And you go on to say that we're headed for your home planet where your race has lived since the beginning of the universe? [Nibbler says something that sounds like ""yes"".] So, how did the universe begin? [Nibbler tells her.] Then the meaning of existence-- [Nibbler acknowledges.] So every religion is wrong!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Linda," [on TV] You fell! [She turns to the camera and waves.] Hi! Today some bad things happened. One bad thing was a train got crashed in New Jersey. Wanna see? [The picture cuts to footage of a flaming train wreck.] People won't be late for work though, because the governor lady said, [deeper voice] ""I'm sending in more trains!"""
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Woman, [on TV] Go!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Man, [on TV] Wait for me! Wait for me!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Morbo, [on TV] Morbo can't understand his TelePrompTer. He forgot how you say that letter that looks like a man with a hat.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Linda," [on TV] It's a ""T"". It goes ""tuh""."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Morbo," [waving; on TV] Hello, little man. I will destroy you!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," Man, even the news monster is acting strange. What are we gonna do?"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Farnsworth," Duh, I know! Let's play the lottery!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Amy, No. Let's buy Internet stock!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Zoidberg, On margin! Zoidy wanna buy on margin!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Hermes, Look at me! I'm invisible!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry, Wait a minute! I know what's going on here. You've all become idiots!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Bender," Hey, let's all join the Reform Party!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Hermes," Oh, yeah!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Ken," Welcome back, Lord Nibbler, Ambassador to Earth, homeworld of the pizza bagel."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Nibbler, Thank you. I bear many receipts for reimbursement.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fiona," The four welcomes of friendship to you as well, Leela. We shall manipulate your mind so we appear to be speaking your language. Do not be afraid, my child."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, I'm not afraid.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fiona," Uh, good. Good."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela," So, your real name is Lord Nibbler? That's a coincidence."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Nibbler," That name is for your sake. In the time it would take to pronounce one letter of my true name, a trillion cosmoses would flair into existence and sink into eternal night."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela," Oh, you're all so cute!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Ken," No, we're not. [He pulls his hood off.] We Nibblonians are an ancient and powerful race. Behold. [A hologram appears above his head and changes as he narrates.] When the universe was forged in the crucible of the Big Bang, our mighty race was already 17 years old."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, Aww!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Ken," For the first millisecond of time, things were OK. But then there arose a terrible enemy  The Brain Spawn. [The Nibblonians chatter.] Ever since, we have waged unceasing war against these dreadful--"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Nibblonian Chef, Lunch is ready.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Ken, Then let the feast of a thousand hams begin.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela," So why are these Brain Spawn attacking Earth, Nibbler?"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Nibbler, The Brain Spawn hate all consciousness. The thoughts of others screech at them like the forced laughs of a billion art house movie patrons.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Ken," Thus, they travel from world to world making everyone stupid in order to wipe out all thought in the universe."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, Wipe out all thought? My God! They're like flying televisions.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fiona," And even we are powerless to stop them, fearsome though we are."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Nibbler," There is but one being who can resist them. A child of destiny whose bizarre brain wave pattern makes him immune to the Brain Spawn attack. [The hologram changes to Fry sitting in the Planet Express lounge looking at the soles of his feet.] He is the hope of the universe. [Leela gasps.] The fate of your world, perhaps all worlds, rests in his special mind."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela," Now, when you say ""special""..."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," Attention, New New Yorkers. Stop acting so stupid!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Ken," [on radio] Nibblonian fleet holding at perimeter of moron zone, formerly known as ""Earth""."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, Why would Fry be immune to the flying brains? Because he doesn't shower?
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fiona," The Brain Spawn suppress intelligence by attacking the delta brain wave. Every animal and robot in the universe generates this wave, as do certain trees."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Nibbler," Fry, however, does not."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fiona, Somehow he has cobbled together a random assortment of other brain waves into a working mind.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, Like a prom dress made from carpet remnants.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Nibbler," Yes, like your prom dress."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Ken," The Brain Spawn are commanded by a giant, evil brain with a gooey centre of pure hate."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fiona," Only Fry, with his superior, yet inferior mind, can approach him. You must tell him to disable it. We will do the rest."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, You can count on me.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fiona," No, we can't. Once on Earth, you will be too stupid to remember the message."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Nibbler, That's why we wrote it down for you.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Ken, We've also prepared a bag lunch and some mittens.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," Time to re-educate you dunce-bags. We'll start with US presidents. [He takes a head in a jar out of the box.] This was our first president, George Washington. [The staff stare blankly. Amy twitches and Farnsworth scratches his head.] Let's review. Who was our first president?"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Amy, Um.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Bender, A pickle jar?
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Washington, Thomas Jefferson?
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry, Leela! I've been so worried. Are you a bonehead?
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, I ... have to tell ... must ... important ... something--
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," Whoa, whoa! Slow down. You're going a mile a minute."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, This! You for this!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry, Thanks!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, No! [She runs over to it and puts her hand in the flame.] Ow! Fire hot.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Farnsworth, The professy will help! [He puts his hand in and his lab coat catches fire. He screams.] Fire indeed hot!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Arthur, Oh! Chester A. Arthur fall down.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, Brain. Brain make people dumb.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," No, Leela. Brain make people smart."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, You go fight biggest brain of all.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry, Even bigger than those? Holy nuts! Where is it?
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, [shrugging] I 'unno!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry, Hm. A giant brain is basically a giant nerd. And where would a giant nerd be? [He gasps.] The libary!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Big Brain," Pathetic human race. Arranging their knowledge by category just made it easier to absorb. Dewey, you fool, your decimal system has played right into my hands! [It laughs. Fry pushes the door wide open and he and Leela run in. Before the Big Brain can react, Fry has closed the door and Leela has tipped a bookshelf over so it blocks the door. It gasps.] What do you want?"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry, I'm here to kick your ass.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Big Brain, Wishful thinking. We have long since evolved beyond the need for asses. [It flies up towards the ceiling and envelopes Fry's head in a blue glow.] Odd. My stupefaction field is having no effect on your ability to think.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," That's right. And I think you'll find that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing! [He throws a book at the brain. It bounces of it harmlessly.] OK, better think of a new plan. Come on, Fry, think! [He rubs his temple.] Thinking ... thinking..."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Big Brain, Oh! Stop that!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," Hey! Thinking hurts him. Maybe I can think of a way to use that. [The Brain groans again.] Aha! Prepare to be thought at. Leela, give me a topic."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, Duh...
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," Seriously, I can't think of anything. [The Brain laughs, it's strength returning. Fry picks up some books.] Gotta find something to make me think. Hardy Boys, too easy. Nancy Drew, too hard. Aha! Perfect! Bonfire of the Vanities!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Big Brain, No! It's unbearable!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fiona, The brains are weakening. [She presses an intercom button.] Nibblonians to Nibble stations. Prepare cuddle bug for deployment in 40 nibblets.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Nibbler, Sometimes I fear we are cute.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fiona," Oh, niggle-snoosh!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry, Take that! And that! This sentence I don't understand but take this one!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Big Brain, You have not won yet. [It's purple glow returns.] Each book in this room is a gateway to a mental realm and I shall take you there and imprison you forever.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, Icky!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry, Where are we?
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Ahab, A gold doubloon to the man who first spies the white whale.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Queequeg, [pointing] Big whale over there.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Ahab, Arr! I saw it first!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Queequeg," Wait! That no white whale. It grey, think-y whale!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," Queequeg, let go of me! I have to kill it!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Big Brain," Farewell! You will all be trapped in this dense, symbolist tome forever!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry, Follow him! It's our only way out!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," Excuse me, have you seen a giant brain?"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Tom Sawyer, Yep. I let him help me whitewash Aunt Polly's fence.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Big Brain," Tom Sawyer, you tricked me. This is less fun than previously indicated. Let this corny slice of Americana be your tomb for all eternity."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Tom Sawyer," Please, no!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry, [shouting] Come on!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Woman," Mr. Fry, Mama tells us you're quite the oddity; a bachelor at your age."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry, You think I'm an oddity? Wait'll you see--
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Butler," Presenting the most eligible landowner in all Hertfordshire, Mr. Brainly."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Big Brain, I'm a gigantic brain!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Man #1, I say!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Man #2, Most un-gentleman-like!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Woman," Mr. Brainly, what news have you of the London season?"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Big Brain, Well--
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," Hey, Brain-y! Think fast!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Big Brain, I always think fast.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Ahab, The whale! He be white now!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," Leela, I've got an idea. Stay here with Queequeg."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, Is there Mrs. Queequeg?
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," Yes! I'm free! [He begins to climb a bookcase. He stands on the top of it with a book in one hand. He grabs a light with the other.] Alright, Brain. Get ready for some electroshock treatment!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela," Fry, don't die! Wake up! [He dies.] [screaming] Nooo!"
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," [writing] Leela cried for her lost love as Fry lay dead under the heavy bookcase. The Big Brain laughed in triumph... [He laughs.] Then, for no reason, he left Earth forever. The end. [He closes the book.] There! [He writes ""Fry Trick The Brain"" on the cover.] Now he's trapped in a book I wrote; a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Big Brain, The Big Brain am winning again. I am the greetest! [It laughs.] Now I am leaving Earth for no raeson!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Nibbler, The Big Brain is defeated. Let what must be done be done.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, Me ... feel ... a bit better in cognitive faculties.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Fry," [jumping up] I did it! [He holds up a book and addresses the ""camera"".] And it's all thanks to the books at my local library."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Nibbler," [voice-over] And so life returned to normal, or as normal as it gets on this primitive dirtball inhabited by psychotic apes."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Nibbler," [voice-over] Thanks to the effect of the brain rays, the people of Earth had no memory of what had transpired, except Fry, and no one believed him or cared what he had to say."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Nibbler," [voice-over] I, meanwhile, returned to my post, ever vigilant, lest Earth again come under Brain attack. And when that day comes, God help us. God help us all."
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Leela, Time for a diap-y change!
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,Nibbler, [voice-over] End transmission.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid,,
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, This place was a great choice. The food is amazing. And such generous portions.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Doug, You like the meal just wait until you try these after-dinner mints.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," You know, Doug, most guys are put off by my eye. It's nice to finally meet someone who's open-minded. [They gaze across the table into each other's eyes. Without averting his gaze, Doug slips out a long pink tongue and licks up the mint.] Ew!"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, What was wrong with your date last night?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, I don't know. Something I couldn't quite put my finger on. Possibly his vile lizard tongue.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Amy, You're too picky.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry," Yeah. If you rule out every guy with a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an explosive violent temper, of course you're gonna be lonely."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, There's nothing wrong with having high standards. Now can we please stop--
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zoidberg, The female Leela's problem is purely medical. Soon she will drop her eggs and they will hatch and all will be well.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Amy," You just have to give guys a chance. Sometimes you meet a guy and think he's a pig, but then later you realise he actually has a really good body."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Thank you all for the inspiring advice, but I'm perfectly happy with my life the way it is."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, That sounds like a cry for help.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Amy, Let's all take her out tonight. There's lots of great places to meet people.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Hermes, The Federal Sex Bureau.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, A saucy puppet show.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zoidberg, The rotting carcass of a whale.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Amy," Hmm, I'll pick!"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Amy," Oh, wow! It's totally retro!"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, Why's everyone wearing those rings?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Amy, Guh! Because nobody wears them anymore! Rings are stupid!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, I think they look cool.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Amy, Sh! Don't let anyone hear you say that!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Man," Hey, did that guy just say rings are cool?"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Amy," Nope, he said they're stupid."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Man, Cool!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Amy, So what do you think of that guy by the bar?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, I don't know. Maybe?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender," Forget it, he's gay."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, What? How can you tell?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, I just know these things. I've got what they call gaydar.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, There's no such thing.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender," No? [He pulls out a machine with a small antenna on it from his chest cabinet. The antenna swivels around.] OK, I got a lock on him. [The machine beeps.] Yep! He's gay!"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Amy, Are you sure?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, Definitely. Unless I'm getting interference from a gay weather balloon.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,21st-century girl, You're from the 20th century? That's incredible! I'm from the 21st century.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, No way! We've got so much in common.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,21st-century girl, We sure do. Remember when those cyborgs enslaved humanity?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry," Uh, yeah! That rings a bell."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Amy, This is Bolt Rolands. Bolt is a hyper-sled racer with 10 wins on the pro-circuit.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bolt," Hello, beautiful!"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, [whispering] I think she means 10 wins on the gay circuit.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bolt, I wish! Those cats can really fly.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Amy," This is M5438, an entity of pure energy."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," That's great, really, but he's just not what I'm looking for."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,M-5438," I understand. One day you will evolve beyond your physical body, and on that day I hope you will pick up the phone."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Amy, You're impossible.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, Just as well; I think he comes from a dimension that's big on musical theatre.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, Pst. I need the apartment tonight. Go see a saucy puppet show.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, Can do!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,The Hip Joint janitor," My, my, my! What's a beautiful lady like you— [Leela looks up.] Oh, my! Eurgh! I'm sorry, I thought you had two eyes."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender," So, Leela, you must have had your pick of the litter last night at closing time."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, Could you guys please stop talking about my personal life?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Farnsworth," Yes, let's all talk about Leela's personal life later. But right now we have business to attend to."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, A delivery?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Farnsworth, No. A tax-deductible mission of charity.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Computer Voice, This is Vergon 6.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Farnsworth, This is Vergon 6.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Amy, [sarcastic] Buh!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Farnsworth," It's a sunny little doomed planet, inhabited by a number of frisky little doomed animals."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, Animals?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Farnsworth," That's right. Animals in desperate need of rescue. You see, Vergon 6 was once filled with a super-dense substance known as dark matter, each pound of which weighs over ten thousand  pounds."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, Wait! What about the animals?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Farnsworth," Well, dark matter is extremely valuable as starship fuel. That's why it was all mined out, leaving the planet completely hollow."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Yes, but what about the animals?"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Farnsworth, The wha?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, The animals.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Farnsworth," I didn't say anything about animals. Now it seems that the planet will collapse within three days. Incidentally, this will kill all the animals."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, So we have to bring back two of each kind. Just like Noah's Ark.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, Why two? [Leela whispers something to him.] Oh!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, I bet you Leela's holding out for a nice guy with one eye.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender," That'll take forever. What she oughta do is find a nice guy with two eyes, then poke one out."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry," Yeah, that'd be a timesaver."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, Do you mind?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, Here you go. [He pulls out a fork.] You can use this as an eye-poker.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Thank you. But I don't care how many eyes a man has ... as long as it's less than five. All I'm looking for is a guy who's adventurous, self-confident..."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, [from ship] ...maybe a snappy dresser.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," These new uniforms are pretty snappy, eh, first officer?"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Kif," I suppose, Captain. I'm not as big a fan of velour as you are. Now what do you want to do about that unidentified ship?"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, Destroy them! [As he raises his arm he flexes his muscle. He stops to feel it.] Mmm! That's got a nice feel to it.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," Captain's journal  Star date, 3000.3."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Kif," Who are you talking to, sir?"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," You! Aren't you getting this? [Kif sighs and scurries to a typing machine. Zapp dictates.] We have detected a vessel attempting to break the security cordon around Vergon 6. I'm anticipating an all-out tactical dogfight, followed by a light dinner ... ravioli, ham, sundae bar."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Hey, look! That's Zapp Brannigan's ship."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, Uh-huh!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, Who's the Zapp Brannigan?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Kif," Shall I fire on them now, sir?"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," Not yet, Kif. In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary see your pieces. [Kif sighs.] What?"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly saved the Octillian System from a horde of rampaging Killbots.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, Wow!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender," A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we can always build more Killbots!"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, He's the most decorated captain in the whole Democratic Order of Planets.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, [teasing] Leela's got a boyfriend!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, No I don't. But I think we ought to meet with him and see if he'll help us rescue those animals.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender," Well, just in case you guys hit it off, you'll wanna take this with you. [He holds up the fork.]"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Kif," Sir, they're headed straight for us."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," A well-calculated move straight out of Sun Tzu's classic text The Art Of War, or my own masterwork  Zapp Brannigan's Big Book of War. [He holds up the book with a picture of him on the front.] But the one thing their captain doesn't realise and never will is that--"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Kif," Sir, they've docked with us and have come aboard."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," Then I have risked all and lost. Kif, old man, I'll be in the escape pod. [He gets up and heads for the door.] If that wicker chair I like survives the slaughter, have it sent to my P.O. box."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Hello, I'm Leela, captain of the Planet Express delivery ship. We've come aboard to plead for your assistance."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Kif," Well, if there's anything--"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, I'm in command here. Zapp Brannigan. Has my fame preceded me or was I too quick for you?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Oh, not at all. I'm just so, uh, really thrilled to meet you!"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, You're an impressive piece of captain. Beautiful and deadly -- a potent combination.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, [flattered] You don't mean that!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," But I do. I doubt I've seen more than three or four captains sexier than you, and only one who was deadlier."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, I heard that one time you single-handedly defeated a horde of rampaging somethings in the something-something-system.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, The Killbots? A trifle! It was simply a matter of outsmarting them.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, Wow! I never would have thought of that!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," You see, Killbots have a preset kill limit. Knowing their weakness, I sent wave after wave of my own men at them, until they reached their limit and shutdown. Kif, show them the medal I won. [Kif sighs and points to a medal on Zapp's uniform.]"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," More, please. [Kif grates.] A little more ... more ... keep going."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Captain Brannigan, we really need to talk to you about our mission."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," Whatever it is, I'm willing to put wave after wave of men at your disposal. Right, men?"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Crewman, [shouting] You suck!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, We're hoping to save the animals of Vergon 6 from extinction. And if you could just--
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, Vergon 6? This light dinner is over.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, Wait! What's wrong?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," The Democratic Order of Planets prohibits interfering with undeveloped worlds. It's a little rule known as ""Brannigan's Law""."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, But people already interfered. That planet was mined completely hollow.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," Yes, by a Democratic Order of Planets mining crew."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, This doesn't make any sense.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, I don't pretend to understand Brannigan's Law. I merely enforce it.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, Fine! We'll save the animals without your help.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, I'm afraid I can't allow that. Guards!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, What just happened?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, He's throwing us in prison.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, Ow! I might've liked Zapp Brannigan if he weren't a pompous dimwit who threw me in prison.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, You really are too picky.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," Kif, follow me up to the observation deck. I've got some musing to do."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Kif," Oh, jeez!"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," I'm facing a formidable female adversary, Kif. Suggestions?"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Kif," I fail to see any problem, sir. You already imprisoned her under directive B-10.8-1."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, You mean Brannigan's Law?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Kif," Right, that law."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, Which one?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Kif, Brannigan's Law.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," Kif, you're my best and most loyal friend but you've earned my contempt once again. As my protégé you should know that the only way to deal with a female adversary is to seduce her. [Kif sighs.] This time we are sure she's a woman, right?"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Kif, Yes.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," Good! Invite her to my quarters. Oh, and have the boy lay out my formal shorts."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Kif," ""The boy"", sir?"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, You. You lay out my formal shorts.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Kif, The jackass wants to see you in his quarters.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Good. This will be my chance to reason with him, captain to captain."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Kif, And he wants you to wear this.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, [sexilly; from inside] Come and get it!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," Welcome to my humble chamber, or as I call it, ""the Lovenasium"". Sham-pag-in?"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, I didn't realise you were such a coin-a-sewer.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, Well I have studied abroad. Or two!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, Captain--
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, Uh-huh?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, If we could speak seriously for a moment--
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, Uh-huh?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, I'd like you to reconsider letting us rescue those animals.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, Mm-hm. [He moves the bed closer to Leela. Leela pulls the plug out of the socket and the bed falls to the floor.] I like your style. I find it very... (whispering) erotic.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, What?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, [shouting] Erotic!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry," We can definitely escape, Bender. All you have to do is bend the hatch off this steam pipe."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender," Hey, yeah!"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, No good! It's full of steam!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, You look like a woman who enjoys the finer things. Come over here and feel my velour bedspread.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, I'm not really in the mood.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," Leela, it's real velour. Just let yourself go."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, Can I please just go back to prison?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, You'd rather sit in prison than spend one evening with the Zapper?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, Much rather! [Zapp starts to cry.] What are you doing?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," [crying] Oh, God, I'm pathetic. Sorry. Just go. You want the rest of the sham-pag-in?"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," No. And it's pronounced ""sham-pane""."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," [crying] Oh, God, no!"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, It's not a big deal.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," [crying] I get so lonely. I just thought you, a fellow captain, would understand."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Oh, forget it."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," [crying] Yeah, it's great ordering people around and stuff but through it all you're completely alone."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, It comes with the job.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, [crying] I'm just so lonely!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Oh, come on. Cheer up. It's not that bad."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, You wanna try escaping again?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender," Nah, I'm comfy."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry," Man, Leela's been gone a long time. I hope she's at least making progress with Zapp Brannigan."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," Good morning, lover."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Uh, listen, Zapp."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, Now you're officially my woman. Kudos! I can't say I don't envy you.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Zapp, last night was a mistake."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, A sexy mistake.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," No, just a regular mistake. For a split second my common sense was overwhelmed by pity."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, A split second is all it takes. That's why sooner or later you'll come crawling back to the Zapper.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, The only kind of crawling I'm doing to you is away ... from!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," Leela, you're obviously confused and aroused."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Look, I'm going down to Vergon 6 to save those animals whether you like it or not."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, Go ahead. I won't stop you.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, Threaten all you-- Wait. What?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," We both know you won't make it halfway to Vergon 6 before the craving sets in. Then you'll come crawling back for another taste of sweet, sweet candy ... bam!"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, Eurgh!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, [shouting] Kif!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Kif," Yes-- [He groans and looks away. Zapp is standing up holding the bed sheet over his crotch.] Yes, Captain?"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, I have made it with a woman. Inform the men.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Kif, The fatso says you're free to go.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, Really? Why?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Kif," [quietly] ""Why"" indeed."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, What does that mean?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, [defensively] Nothing.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, So should we get our stuff and head down to the planet?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," [defensively] We just talked, OK?!"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Alright, we don't have much time to collect these animals. The planet is supposed to collapse in approximately two hours ago."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Hello, there. [The animal sniffs around Leela's feet.] Hmm. He doesn't seem to be on the checklist."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender," So, you're saying we can cook him?"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry," Yeah, a barbecue! I'll wear my hilarious apron."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," No! I don't care how hilarious your apron is, we're not cooking him. [She picks the thing up.] Aww! I'll call him Nibbler."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, Aww! (whispering to Fry) I'll fire up the grill!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, I hope he'll be OK in there with all those big animals.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," Y'know, Kif, once my woman returns I won't have much time to hang out with the boys anymore."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Kif," That's a shame, sir."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," So let's make the most of our time together, shall we? [They sit in silence.] Never mind. Just give me a back rub."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, I found a pair of hermaphlamingos.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, Good. That's the last species.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, Hey. What the--?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, Where'd they all go?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, Nibbler!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, I can't believe we flew halfway across the galaxy and enjoyed a steam just to get lunch for that stupid animal!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, He's pending for a bending.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Leave him alone. It's not his fault that he's an unstoppable killing machine. Is it, snoogums?"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, The planet's kerploding!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Prepare for lift-off. [She turns the key in the ignition but the engine doesn't start. The fuel gauge reads empty.] We're out of fuel. Bender, I told you to fill the tank before we left."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender," Yeah, I'll do it when we get back."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry," Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, No way! Forget it! I refuse to go crawling back to him!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, What? What are you talking about?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, [defensively] Nothing. We just talked.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender," So what's your problem? It's not like you slept with him. [Leela hangs her head in shame.] Oh, my God!"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry," How could you, Leela? I thought you had some standards. I mean, jeez, he's a dumb, gross gorilla!"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, That's enough! Don't you think I feel bad enough already?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, No!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Alright, alright. I'll call him. [She presses a button and the videophone comes down.] I mean, if living is that important to you."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," And that's why you'll never make captain, Kif. [""Incoming Message"" repeatedly flashes on the viewscreen.] Hmm."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," [on screen] Hello, Zapp?"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," Well, well, well!"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Zapp, we're out of fuel..."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, [on screen] ...and Vergon 6 is about to implode. We need your help.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," So, crawling back to the Big Z like a bird on its belly. Delicious."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, [on screen] Bird's don't crawl.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, They've been known to.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Look, are you going to rescue us or not?"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, [on screen] Can't you ask a little more ... sexfully?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, [sexfully] Please?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, [sexfully; on screen] Big Z?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," Certainly. But first you'll have to get rid of that thing. [He points at Nibbler] That's the law, Leela. And Brannigan's Law is like Brannigan's love  Hard and fast!"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, [on screen] Now put that greasy rat outside and we'll tow you to safety.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," I would never abandon a helpless animal. Y'know, Zapp, once I thought you were a big, pompous buffoon. Then I realised that inside you were just a pitiful child. But now I realise that outside that child is a big, pompous buffoon!"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, [on screen] And which one rocked your world?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, Wow! Way to tell that guy off. Now what's your secret escape plan?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," Uh, I guess to sit here and wait for death."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, Can do!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, What the hell was that?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, Pew!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, I don't believe it! It's dark matter.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel?
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela," His species must've filled the entire planet with it. Did you do that, you cute little-- [The ship shakes again.] Come on. That should be more than enough fuel to get us outta here. Bender, pick it up and put it in the engine."
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, We made it! [She looks through a pair of binoculars.] And some of the animals survived.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Bender, So a couple of animals didn't die and Leela got lucky. That's what I call a successful mission!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Fry, We're heroes!
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Leela, [thinking] Dear Captain's Diary  I may not have found love on this mission but I did find a cute little companion who excretes starship fuel. And that's just as good.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, [from inside] Captain's journal  Star date ... uh.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Kif, [from inside] April 13th.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp, [from inside] April 13th ... point two.
Love's Labours Lost in Space,Zapp," We have failed to uphold Brannigan's Law. However, I did make it with a hot alien babe. And in the end is that not what man has dreamt of since first he looked up at the stars? Kif, I'm asking you a question!"
Love's Labours Lost in Space,,
That's Lobstertainment!,Humorbot 5.0," So I says, ""Super collider? I just met her!"" [The audience laughs.] And then they built the super collider. Thank you, you've been a great audience."
That's Lobstertainment!,Florp," Humorbot 5.0, ladies and gentlemen. Our next stand-up's a veteran of four comedy traffic schools. Give it way up for Bobcat Zoidberg!"
That's Lobstertainment!,Fry, [cheering] Alright!
That's Lobstertainment!,Leela, [cheering] Yeah!
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender," [cheering] Alright, Zoidberg!"
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," Earth  What a planet. On Earth, you enjoy eating a tasty clam. On my planet, clams enjoy eating a tasty you. [There is silence.] Maybe I'm not yelling loud enough. [shouting] On Earth, everybody is always looking for a giant squid. On my planet--"
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender, Reload.
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, So these three parasitic worms bore into a human's head--
That's Lobstertainment!,Woman #1," Ew, gross."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," And they walk up to the bar and then-- Uh-oh. [He sees a hook come on from the side of the stage.] Wait, stop! I've got more!"
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, My whole life I worked on that act. And they hated it.
That's Lobstertainment!,Hermes," You're a crazy, penniless, lobster doctor. No combination of you should be a comedian."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, But comedy is in my valves. My Uncle Harold was a big Hollywood star back in the era of silent holograms.
That's Lobstertainment!,Leela, Your uncle was Harold Zoid?
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, This I cannot deny.
That's Lobstertainment!,Farnsworth," Why, I've been a Harold Zoid fan since back when my hips were made of bone. As it happens, I still have some of my original 78s."
That's Lobstertainment!,Hermes," You're right, crabby. He's a hell of a lot funnier than you could ever be."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," Maybe so, but perhaps if I wrote him and asked for a few hundred pointers..."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," This letter has to be very personal, so I'm writing it in my own ink. [He puts a jar under his armpit and fills it with black ink. He dips a quill pen in and starts writing.] [thinking] Dear Uncle Zoid, greetings from your long-lost nephew. Norm and Sam and Sadie's boy, remember?"
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," [voice-over] Now I am the most important doctor at the delivery company where I work. But, sadly, my life is bereft of laughter."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," [reading] I beg of you, Mr. Funny Uncle, teach me the comedy business. Sincerely, Zoidberg. [talking] Oy, isn't that nice? He took the time."
That's Lobstertainment!,Woman #2, What's that scribbledy-gook?
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," This is a fan letter from my rich doctor nephew, who just might be my ticket out of this flophouse, he might. [The woman makes a weird noise and walks away.] Yeah, you'd better run. [He fills a jar of ink and writes.] Dear Rich Doctor Nephew, I can help you be funny. The first funny thing you must do is put all your money in the form of a cashier's check and come to Hollywood."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," [reading] Sincerely, Harold Zoid. P.S. Cashier's check. [talking] Did you hear that? I'm going to Hollywood!"
That's Lobstertainment!,Tour Guide," Welcome to Hollywood! I must warn you, there's no refund if you get discovered and leave the tour! [She laughs to herself.] I'm just kidding, that never happens. Now, to your right, you'll see 30th Century Fox Studios. [The building looks just like the logo for 20th Century Fox, updated slightly.] Fox uses those searchlights to blind pilots, then film the resulting plane crashes."
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender, Neat!
That's Lobstertainment!,Tour Guide," Ahead, you'll see the home of Mel Gibson, star of the hit film, Bravehead. [Gibson's head in a jar peeps through the door of his tiny house.] And do we have any fans of Calculon, star of the robot soap opera All My Circuits?"
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender," Oh! I am! Me! [He raises his hand, takes his whole arm off and waves it around with the other hand.] Bender is!"
That's Lobstertainment!,Tour Guide, Then you'll wanna get a close look at his luxurious Bel-Air home.
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender," Yes, I will."
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, Are you my new hot water heater?
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender," No, I'm Bender. We met once, remember?"
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, Absolutely not.
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender," Come on, don't you remember how much I was bugging you, don't you? 'Cause it was a lot, you remember, right?"
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon," Look, I'm programmed to be very busy. Unless you can heat water to 212 degrees, I'm not interested. [He closes the door and Bender immediately rings the bell. Calculon opens the door again.] Have you got an extra GOTO 10 line? I said I don't need a bender."
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender, Bender? That was the other guy. My name's Boiler.
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon," Nice work, Boiler."
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender, Thanks. And call me Bender.
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," That's where I'm meeting Uncle Zoid for lunch to discuss my Hollywood dreams. Next time you see me, don't be surprised if I've eaten."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," Uncle Zoid, you're looking young enough to be thrown back!"
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," Rich nephew, come over here and give your uncle a nice, big meal. [They hug and sit down.] So, here we are  A still-famous film comedian."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," And a rich, respected doctor with many surviving patients."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," Eating real food in a restaurant, as we both often do. So, you want to be a comedian, is it?"
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, It's my lifelong dream.
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid, [shouting] Well that dream dies now. [He bangs his claw on the table.] You're unfunny and untalented. That's why you're perfect for drama.
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, Hmm. Serious drama. Perhaps it is time to give up comedy.
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," I'm putting together a big drama picture right now, as we speak. The script is dynamite. I know because I wrote it myself. And with me directing and starring, I'll be back on top after 50 miserable years-- [Zoidberg gives him a curious look.] Uh, of fame."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," Ah, fame. Where do I come in?"
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," This fame film has a juicy part for you, if you completely finance it with your doctor money. So, are you in?"
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," Uh, OK. How much do I have to invest?"
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," Oh, not much, not much, [quietly and quickly] A million dollars. [Zoidberg spits water out off every valve in his head.] [normal] Then it's settled. Another blockbuster Hollywood deal."
That's Lobstertainment!,Waiter, What can I get you gentlemen?
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, Is bread free?
That's Lobstertainment!,Waiter, Yeah.
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, We'll split an order.
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender, What's with Monstro?
That's Lobstertainment!,Fry, He promised he'd give his Uncle Zoid a million bucks to make a movie.
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, [crying] I've only been here a day and already I'm a Hollywood phoney.
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender," [proud] Well, perhaps I could call on TV's Calculon to help, now that I'm in showbiz."
That's Lobstertainment!,Fry, Since when have you been in the biz?
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender," Long enough, little man. Long enough."
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender," Calculon, as your hot water heater ... [Calculon uses Bender as a hot water caddy and pours water into a mug with a tea bag in it.] ... I would be remiss if I didn't bring you scripts that could make you an international film star."
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, Of course. Tell me about the project.
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, It's a movie.
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, Interesting. Tell me more.
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender," Get this  For a scant $1 million investment, you can be the star."
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, And?
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender," And, uh, I guarantee it'll win you an Oscar."
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon," An Oscar, you say? That would get me out of this festering rat's nest called ""television"" once and for all. Let me see the script. [Zoidberg hands it to him and he speed-reads it.] No. No, I don't like the font. [He looks at the cover.] Wait! Harold Zoid? Was this written by the Harold Zoid?"
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, Written and Xeroxed.
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, Good heavens! A chance to work with the legendary Harold Zoid. He's one of my great idols. And-And you say you can guarantee me the Oscar?
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender, I can guarantee anything you want.
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, Then I'll do it!
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, Hooray!
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender, Here's your chequebook.
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon," Ladies and gentlemen, I give you our director, the legendary Harold Zoid!"
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," Thank you. A more classic movie plot there isn't  A son who does not want to follow in his father's business. And that business is being President of Earth, no less. The son, as it happens, is Vice President."
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender," [to Calculon] That plot makes perfect sense. Wink, wink."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," Bender, you said ""wink, wink"" out loud."
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender," No, I didn't. Raise middle finger."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," Now remember, and I can't stress this enough, this is a talkie, so I want the full gamut of emotions from every actor in every scene."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," The Magnificent Three. Scene one, take one."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," And, action!"
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon," Take back your gilded pen, Father. Signing bills into law was always your dream, not mine."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," Cut! Cut! Cut it! [He spits.] I said this is a talkie, damnit! You've got to emote more! And you extras, wave your arms and make faces. What is this, a morgue?"
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," The Magnificent Three. Scene 10, take 95."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid, Action. And I mean circus-grade action.
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon," [melodramatically] Sir, I call upon you not as a President but as a father."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," Cut, cut, cut it! [He turns to Calculon.] Would you show a little emotion? [He turns to the extras.] People, people, please. Just because it's a dramatic scene, doesn't mean you can't do a little comedy in the background. [The extras nod.] Throw a pie or two, for God's sake."
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, [screaming] Nooo!
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," Cut, cut it! Eck! Look, look, it's alright, kid. We'll, uh, we'll get it in editing. Alright, that's a wrap, everybody. I'm gonna see you all at the premiere which, by the way, when is?"
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," Well, editing is a long and expensive process but we spent all the money on pies, so it'll be ready Friday."
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender," Nice turnout, Calculon. That Oscar's practically on your mantel."
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, I just pray they like me half as much as I do.
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon," [in movie] I agreed to be your Vice President but I never agreed to be your son. [He splashes water in Zoid's face and leaves. Zoidberg, wearing a white naval uniform, opens the door for him and salutes.] Thank you, Lieutenant Smith."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," [in movie] Good morning, Mr. Vice President!"
That's Lobstertainment!,Fry," Leela, we're missing the premiere. [Leela wears a dress and hair sticks.] My only goal in life was to attend a Hollywood shindig. Just pay the valet the two bucks."
That's Lobstertainment!,Leela," No! It's the principle of the thing. Besides, I think I see a parking lot up ahead."
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon," [in movie] Father, I've asked you to join me on the White House roof so we could have a heart-to-heart talk. I will never follow in your footsteps. Here is my resignation as Vice President."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," [in movie] No! My son will not shame me like this. I would sooner die, I would!"
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, [in movie] Father! The ledge!
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid, [in movie] Oy!
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, [in movie] Oh!
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," [in movie] The President is dead. Congratulations, Mr. President!"
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, [screaming; in movie] Nooo!
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender, [cheering] Woo-hoo! Yeah! He's a visionary!
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, Everyone walked out. They hated it. I've seen plagues that had better opening nights than this. You said that Oscar was practically on my mantel.
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender," Now you know why I use the qualifier, ""practically""."
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, You listen to me. I'm out a million bucks here! You get me that Oscar or you're dead! You and these snivelling lobsters! Dead. You hear me? Dead!
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," Oy, now he emotes!"
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, Let's just hope Calculon breaks our legs; they'll grow back.
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," He's gonna kill us, you klutzel! Who told that under-acting stiff he was going to get an Oscar?"
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender, Me. It seemed like the least honest way to get him to pay for the movie.
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," He paid? [He turns to Zoidberg.] I though you paid, with your big-shot doctor money."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, [crying] I lied.
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," OK, enough with the blubbering, already. The way I directed the hell out of him, he may still very well get the nomination."
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender, Wink.
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, 400 categories and not a single nomination for me.
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, But you won this Golden Globe!
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, Piffle! That's the Emmy of movie awards! [He throws it towards Bender. He dodges it and it hits an All My Circuits  The Movie poster.] I told you I want an Oscar.
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender, Then maybe you should act better.
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, The Oscar isn't about acting. It's about earning the respect and admiration of the creative community.
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid, How 'bout we rig the awards?
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, That's fine too.
That's Lobstertainment!,Leela," It's no use. The tar is too thick. Plus, I think I flooded it."
That's Lobstertainment!,Fry," Well, we missed the premiere and we're gonna die. We might as well enjoy the sights. [He looks out of the window and a skeleton floats past.] Oh, my God! Sylvester Stallone!"
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, This is where you live? I though you were a big-shot Hollywood movie star.
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," No, I'm not. I'm an even bigger liar than you. My career went down the tubes the day they invented smell-a-vision."
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender, Calculon's gonna kill us for sure. It's all everybody else's fault.
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid, Oy. All I wanted was for people to think of me one last time before I die.
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," What are you talking about, Uncle? Everybody remembers Harold Zoid!"
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," As a pathetic has-been, they remember me. As a forgotten relic, they remember me. Bah! It's better to die now."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, No. This is one death Dr. Zoidberg won't be responsible for. Zoidberg away!
That's Lobstertainment!,Rivers," Hi, I'm Joan Rivers' head. I tell you, I've had so many face-lifts, they finally lifted it right off my body! It's true, it's true! Oh, oh, oh! Here comes Jack Nicholson's DNA reconstituted in a gorilla body."
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender, Catering.
That's Lobstertainment!,Rivers," Oh, and here's washed-up actor, whatshisname, Harold Zoid. Are you presenting one of those tacky honorary awards, or just getting one?"
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," I'm a seat-filler, Joan's head. My only marketable skill is to occupy space."
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon," You know, the second I don't win that award, you're cat food. Right, Boxy?"
That's Lobstertainment!,Announcer," And now, the host of the 1074th Academy Awards, Billy Crystal."
That's Lobstertainment!,Crystal," Now I know how a Pez dispenser feels. [The audience laughs. Jack Nicholson bangs his chest.] Oh, you like that one, Jack? [He impersonates a gorilla. The Oscar statue picks up Crystal's jar and puts it on a podium.] Alright, we're already one hour behind. [Nicholson grunts.] Our first award tonight  Best Cinematography in a Non-Visible Spectrum."
That's Lobstertainment!,Fry, It's been two weeks. You wanna play tic-tac-toe again before we eat our shoes?
That's Lobstertainment!,Leela," Oh, I always knew I'd die at the bottom of a pit. But a pit full of tar?"
That's Lobstertainment!,Fry, What was that? A tar dolphin or a tar shark?
That's Lobstertainment!,Leela," It's some kind of hollow tube, devoid of human life. [She gasps.] The Los Angeles subway! We can blast our way in and escape!"
That's Lobstertainment!,Fry," Alright, but I still feel like having a shoe."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, What category are they on?
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender, They're giving out the minor technical awards. I think they're up to writing.
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, That just leaves Best Soft-Drink Product Placement and then Best Actor. We don't have much time.
That's Lobstertainment!,Crystal, And the nominees for Best Soft-Drink Product Placement are 
That's Lobstertainment!,Slurm Machine," Star Trek  The Pepsi Generation, They Call Me Mr. Pibb and Snow White and the 7 Ups."
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender, And now to present the award for Best Actor ... [Zoidberg walks onto the stage.] ... a bit player in the flop movie The Magnificent Three ... [The audience murmur.] ... Dr. Zoidberg.
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon," [quietly] OK, Boxy, keep your prong on the trigger."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," And the nominees for Best Actor are  Sir Lawrence-- [He makes a weird noise.] ... in The Merchant of Venus, Hive Mind Gamma 7X in Bikini Party Summer, the Soda Machine Robot in Bikini Party Summer, Mark Jones in How Beige Was My Jacket and, instead of the fifth guy, Calculon, for his powerhouse performance in The Magnificent Three."
That's Lobstertainment!,Man #1," Uh-oh, he read the wrong name."
That's Lobstertainment!,Man #2," [whispering] Shh, just play along, like they did for Marisa Tomei."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," Hooray, I won't be murdered. I'll live another day. Another day of ... pathetic, forgotten misery."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg," And the winner is... [Calculon starts to stand up.] And the winner, instead of any of the nominees, is the legendary Harold Zoid!"
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," Thank you. Thank you so much! You know, through all my ups and downs, I always thought the most important thing in life was to win an Oscar. But tonight I realise what's really important is to win two Oscars. Ha! Ha! I'm kidding, I'm kidding. What really matters in life is that people care about you, whether it's a whole crowd ... [The audience is unenthusiastic.] ... or just one die-hard fan."
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," Thank you, nephew. [He kisses him.] Now I can die happy. 10 seconds from now, when Calculon kills us."
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, Harold Zoid!
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender, Hit the deck!
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, Where's that Oscar?
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," Here, enjoy. What are you getting upset? It's slightly less fraudulent for you to have it."
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon," Yes. Yes, it's a real beauty. Someday I hope to win one of my own."
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender," Then you're not going to kill us, Your Majesty?"
That's Lobstertainment!,Calculon, Nay. I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoidberg, Earthquake!
That's Lobstertainment!,Bender, Hit the deck!
That's Lobstertainment!,Zoid," Let the earth quake, I've got somebody's Oscar!"
That's Lobstertainment!,Fry, We made it! I'm at a Hollywood party!
That's Lobstertainment!,Doorman," I'm sorry, sir, this is a private-- Oh, pardon me, I see you're with Mr. Stallone."
That's Lobstertainment!,,
The Cyber House Rules,Morbo," So I gave the cookies you made to Fawn and the kids and they couldn't believe it -- they were delicious. But, I digress. [He turns to the camera.] [shouting] Tremble, puny earthlings! One day my race will destroy you all!"
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, Could one of you guys get that?
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," It's a doorbell baby! [She crouches down to the bundle of blankets in the basket. Fry and Bender appears behind her.] Hello, little guy. You know, I was abandoned as a baby too, so--"
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," Garbage, huh? I'll take care of it."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Bender, stop! It's a baby!"
The Cyber House Rules,Bender, [stamping] A baby what? [Leela kicks him in the head and he falls over.] Ow!
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Oh, it's just a card. From the orphanarium I grew up in."
The Cyber House Rules,Card," Leela, you're invited to a reunion at Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium. [The voice changes to an adult woman's voice.] Please stand clear of self-destructing basket."
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," A reunion at your old orphanarium, eh? You gonna go?"
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," No way, Jose-bot. I never wanna see those other orphans again! Not after the way they used to pick on me."
The Cyber House Rules,Kids, [chanting] One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!
The Cyber House Rules,Kirk," Nice depth-perception, one-eye!"
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," How can you make fun of me, Kirk? You're blind!"
The Cyber House Rules,Kirk," My eyes may not work, but at least I got two of them!"
The Cyber House Rules,Fry," Aww. That's terrible, Leela. But imagine the look on their faces when you show up with two friends who eat all the hors d'Oeuvres."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Well, I wouldn't mind rubbing my success in a few choice faces."
The Cyber House Rules,Bender, Set a course for adventure!
The Cyber House Rules,Fry, Ew!
The Cyber House Rules,Bender, What a dump!
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, Just like old times. Gosh! The bars on the windows seemed so much thicker back then. [An old man approaches her from behind. He is dressed in a grey suit and is wearing a grade 135 badge. He clears his throat and Leela turns around.] Mr. Vogel? Remember me?
The Cyber House Rules,Vogel, Leela! You're worthless and no one will ever love you!
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, You used to say that all the time!
The Cyber House Rules,Vogel," Oh, those were happier days."
The Cyber House Rules,Fry, Mmm! The gristle-in-a-blanket isn't half bad.
The Cyber House Rules,Bender, And try one of these Popsicle sticks. They've absorbed quite a bit of flavour.
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Hey, look. It's our old group picture."
The Cyber House Rules,Fry, I don't see you anywhere.
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, That's me over in Cootietown.
The Cyber House Rules,Bender, Whoa! Get a load of this average-looking guy!
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, That's Adlai Atkins. I used to have kind of a crush on him.
The Cyber House Rules,Kids, [chanting] One-eye! One-eye!
The Cyber House Rules,French Guy, Stupid as a French guy!
The Cyber House Rules,Kids, [chanting] One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Well, it's time to say hello to the old gang."
The Cyber House Rules,Man #1," So, whatcha been up to since you left the orphanarium?"
The Cyber House Rules,Man #2," Uh, living in a box, fighting the shakes. You?"
The Cyber House Rules,Man #1," Selling kidneys, teeth, whatever falls out of me."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," And what am I up to, you ask? Why, I'm a very successful space captain."
The Cyber House Rules,Man #2, Oh.
The Cyber House Rules,Man #1, Wow.
The Cyber House Rules,Man #3," How nice for you, Leela."
The Cyber House Rules,Woman, That's so good for a person with one eye.
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, Hey! You can't feel sorry for me! I'm a space captain and you're a bunch of losers.
The Cyber House Rules,Man #1," Uh, right, right. We're the losers!"
The Cyber House Rules,Kirk," Well, if it isn't old one-eye!"
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Oh, yeah? Well, shut up, cane boy!"
The Cyber House Rules,Man #3, He can't hear you. He's deaf now.
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," Leave Leela alone. She's leading a perfectly normal life. She's not gussied up, duded out, getting down or where it's at. Now run along."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Thanks, Adlai. I guess you never really outgrow being an eyeball-- Oddball!"
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," Nonsense. You're a space captain. That's a fine, conventional profession."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Well, you know, it's just for a package delivery service."
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai, Ah-ah. A package is just a box until it's delivered.
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, Huh. I'd never thought of it that way. So what do you do these days?
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," Oh, I'm a doctor."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," A tall doctor, you say?"
The Cyber House Rules,Vogel," Sir, you seem pretty stable. Have you thought about adopting one of our kids?"
The Cyber House Rules,Fry, Sure haven't.
The Cyber House Rules,Vogel, Well keep adoption in mind. It's a great way to have a kid without having sex.
The Cyber House Rules,Fry, [thoughtful] Really?
The Cyber House Rules,Vogel," Plus, the government will help out with a small stipend of $100 a week."
The Cyber House Rules,Bender, $100 a week?
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai, I'm so sorry I teased you back then. Let me make it up to you. I can fix it so no one ever makes fun of you again.
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, You mean by beating them up? Because I've broken that blind kid's nose like 10 times and it doesn't make any difference.
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," No, I specialise in phaser eye surgery. I can build you a paraffin eye and graft it on with skin from your foot. It won't be able to see but you'll look like a perfectly normal two-eyed person."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, Me? Perfectly normal?
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," Sons, daughters, meet Uncle Fry."
The Cyber House Rules,Fry," Hey, why are those kids following you? Do you have candy stuck to your ass?"
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," No. It's called ""parenting"". Come on, dumplings. We've got 12 government stipends to collect."
The Cyber House Rules,Boy, Our daddy's a giant toy!
The Cyber House Rules,Farnsworth, Phaser eye surgery is a capital idea. I'm sure Leela's tired of morons gaping at her eye all the time.
The Cyber House Rules,Amy," I think cosmetic surgery's great, Leela. I used to be too cute, so I had cuteness-reduction surgery here ... [She points to her cheek.] ... and here."
The Cyber House Rules,Fry, You guys are crazy. Leela doesn't need surgery. You look great the way you are.
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Oh, that's so sweet, Fry. But for once in my life, I just wanna look normal."
The Cyber House Rules,Fry," But you're better than normal, you're abnormal. If you ask me, you shouldn't care what other people think."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, You're right! I'll start by not caring what you think! [She stands up.] I'm getting the surgery.
The Cyber House Rules,Farnsworth, That a girl!
The Cyber House Rules,Amy, Right on!
The Cyber House Rules,Zoidberg," Wonderful. And while you're under the knife, you could also get an ink pouch to help you escape your enemies."
The Cyber House Rules,Farnsworth," That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard, you imbecile!"
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," Now we'll find out if the operation was a success. Hold on to your hats. [He starts to pull the bandages off. The staff peer at her closer. Adlai pulls off the bandages and reveals a smiling, two-eyed, blonde woman. The staff gasp.] Oh, I'm sorry, this is the wrong patient. [They move to another bed and Adlai pulls off the real Leela's bandages. The others gasp at Leela's new face. The pupil in her left eye falls out.] Oops."
The Cyber House Rules,Amy," Leela, those eyes look so great on you."
The Cyber House Rules,Fry, Bah! I think she looked fine before.
The Cyber House Rules,Farnsworth, No.
The Cyber House Rules,Zoidberg, No.
The Cyber House Rules,Amy, Uh-uh.
The Cyber House Rules,Hermes, Wrong.
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Wow, look at me. Although I don't have the hang of blinking yet."
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," You'll get it. Personally, I try not to blink too much because it seems flashy. But when I do, I enjoy it."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, I did it! I blunk!
The Cyber House Rules,Hermes, And just in time to screw up this picture I took!
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, Hooray!
The Cyber House Rules,Walt, Ow!
The Cyber House Rules,Igner, Ow!
The Cyber House Rules,Larry, Ow!
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, I've never felt so unremarkable! Today I actually blended in with a crowd!
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," Kids, meet the jerkbags I work with."
The Cyber House Rules,Kids," [chanting] Hello, jerkbags!"
The Cyber House Rules,Amy," Oh, they're so cute! What are their names?"
The Cyber House Rules,Bender, Kids have names?
The Cyber House Rules,Nina," My name's Nina, and his name's Albert--"
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," And from now on, you're all named Bender Jr.! [He takes a piece of paper out of his chest cabinet.] Lookie here! My first government stipend cheque! 12 baby humans, 1200 wing-wangs!"
The Cyber House Rules,Sally," Daddy Bender, we're hungry."
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," What is it with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food! [The kids look sad.] Oh, fine. I'll get you some stupid food."
The Cyber House Rules,Albert, Can we have Bender burgers again?
The Cyber House Rules,Bender, No. The cat shelter's on to me!
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," Hello, Leela. I was in a nearby tailor getting one of my Hawai'ian shirts toned down, so I thought I'd drop in for your follow-up exam."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, Oh. That's so handsome of you.
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," Just follow the light with your eyes. [He draws the light back and forth in front of her but only the real eye follows it.] Perfect! You know, a guy could fall head-over-heels for a gal like you. [Fry walks behind him and frowns.] As for me, I'm somewhat interested myself."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, What are you saying?
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," I've never been good with words, which is why I'm in such a delicate conundrum. Will you go out with me this Sunday?"
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, Sure!
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," I don't know what else to say, so I'll just say it. Okey-dokey, see you then."
The Cyber House Rules,Fry, This is so unfair! I liked you back when you were a cyclops! That guy's only interested now that you have two eyes.
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, You're just jealous!
The Cyber House Rules,Fry," No, I'm not! Oh, wait, I am. But my point remains valid!"
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Fry, I just wanna try dating a normal man, who if you go somewhere with him no one says he's crummy. I think I deserve that once in life."
The Cyber House Rules,Zoidberg," Be careful with that Adlai, Leela, he's a doctor, they're very poor."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Actually, most doctors are rich."
The Cyber House Rules,Zoidberg," What? When did this happen? You're joking, right? [He shakes her.] That's not funny!"
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," OK, they've got everything you need here  Booze, a couple of peanuts, they got a crapper in the back. That's one of the things you kids do, right?"
The Cyber House Rules,Albert, Yeah.
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," Then knock yourself out. [The kids scream and run off, eating things and spinning around on bar stools.] Hey! Hey! Only eat and drink enough to barely keep yourselves alive! I'm trying to make a profit here."
The Cyber House Rules,Nina, Daddy! Bethany's hitting me!
The Cyber House Rules,Bender, Here.
The Cyber House Rules,Fembot, These kids yours?
The Cyber House Rules,Bender, Yeah.
The Cyber House Rules,Fembot, Ooh. I'm attracted to a man with responsibility!
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," That's me, baby! Let me just ditch the kids in an alley and we can go have some fun."
The Cyber House Rules,Boy, Daddy Bender?
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," Son, daddy's trying to score with a cheap floozy right now, so we need you to cram a Tinkertoy in it!"
The Cyber House Rules,Boy," I love you, Daddy Bender!"
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," Hey, what the hell are you doing? Quit hugging me!"
The Cyber House Rules,Fembot, I guess you're busy. I'll catch you later.
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," You morons! I don't know what you're trying to pull but I got half a mind to hug each and every one of you and see how you like it! [The kids cheer.] [grumbling] Oh, come on!"
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," I thought I'd take you someplace ordinary, a place no one could object to."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, That sounds wonderful.
The Cyber House Rules,Man #4, I'd like an extra-beautiful bouquet for my extra-gorgeous sweetheart.
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," Average, please."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Oh, Adlai, I've had a wonderful time today. No one's stared at me or avoided staring at me or tried to burn me. You make me feel so not weird."
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," Leela, you're 999,999 in a million!"
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, Thanks for coming out to get to know my boyfriend. Isn't he dreamy?
The Cyber House Rules,Zoidberg, [mesmerised] Totally.
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," Uh, listen. I just want you all to know your Leela's one standard lady."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Oh, Adlai, stop!"
The Cyber House Rules,Fry, What's so wonderful about Leela being normal? The rest of us aren't normal and that's what makes us great. Like Dr. Zoidberg  He's a weird monster who smells like he eats garbage and does.
The Cyber House Rules,Zoidberg, Damn right!
The Cyber House Rules,Fry," And the Professor's a senile, amoral crackpot. [Farnsworth blubbers and waves.] Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant."
The Cyber House Rules,Hermes, Tally me banana.
The Cyber House Rules,Fry, Amy's a klutz from Mars.
The Cyber House Rules,Amy, Sploops!
The Cyber House Rules,Farnsworth," And, Fry, you've got that brain thing."
The Cyber House Rules,Fry," I already did! So, Leela, do you wanna be like us? Or do you wanna be like Adlai with no severe mental or social problems whatsoever?"
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, That's the dumbest question I ever heard!
The Cyber House Rules,Farnsworth, She's right!
The Cyber House Rules,Zoidberg, No doubt about it.
The Cyber House Rules,Amy, Duh!
The Cyber House Rules,Hermes, Daylight come!
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," Coming through, watch your heads!"
The Cyber House Rules,Zoidberg, Help! I'm under attack!
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," Remember your manners, kids. Forks go in the left pocket, spoons in the right."
The Cyber House Rules,Elzar, Which one of you cutie muffins gets the children's spicy squab?
The Cyber House Rules,Sam, Me!
The Cyber House Rules,Bender, Ah-ah-ah! What do we say when someone gives you something?
The Cyber House Rules,Sam, 'Bout time!
The Cyber House Rules,Bender, That's my boy!
The Cyber House Rules,Elzar, And here's your check. Bam!
The Cyber House Rules,Albert, I gotta go poopy!
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," Well you should've gone poopy before it was time to run out on the check! C'mon! Go, go! Through the kitchen!"
The Cyber House Rules,Elzar, [shouting] You little crooks! If I catch you I'm going to make cutie-muffin gumbo!
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," You know, seeing that strange robot force 12 children to do his bidding makes me think about kids of our own."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, Us? Me? You? Kids?
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," That's correct. It's time to stop living this vida bachelor loca, settle down and have kids."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Oh, Adlai, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!"
The Cyber House Rules,Albert," Daddy Bender, I want a piggy back ride."
The Cyber House Rules,Bender, Daddy's tired. Let's just have another dog-pile on Fry.
The Cyber House Rules,Sally," Tell us a story, Daddy Bender."
The Cyber House Rules,Kids, [chanting] Story! Story! Story!
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," Alright, fine, gather round."
The Cyber House Rules,Nina, We wanna hear this one again!
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," [reading] ""Bender's Arrest Record"" by the police. On March 3rd at 2pm, Bender was caught shoplifting."
The Cyber House Rules,Albert," Yeah, show us the picture! [Bender shows them a picture of him with a stolen watch on his arm. The kids laugh.] There he is!"
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," OK, kids. It's 9.00, you know what that means. Daddy's sick of looking at you so go to bed. [The kids groan.] The grown-ups have to talk. Come on, Ma."
The Cyber House Rules,Bender, Now to figure out how much money I'm raking in off those twerps! [He and Fry sit down at a cable spool that has been turned over to make a table. Bender looks over his accounts and mutters.] Oh! I need a calculator.
The Cyber House Rules,Fry, You are a calculator.
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," I mean a good calculator. Minus the food, the bunny rabbit wallpaper-- [He gasps.] I'm getting 100 bucks a kid and they're costing me 110!"
The Cyber House Rules,Fry, There goes my new kitchen cabinets.
The Cyber House Rules,Bender, I'm not sitting through one more PTA meeting. The kids have got to go!
The Cyber House Rules,Sam," Daddy, how do I flush you?"
The Cyber House Rules,Bender, [shouting] Just go to bed!
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," You know, doing this jigsaw puzzle of a pacifier factory makes me want to have children with you all the more."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Adlai, I was thinking, since we're both orphans, maybe we should adopt a child."
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," Adoption? Yes, that's acceptable. Heck, it's more than acceptable, it's adequately satisfactory!"
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," Hello? Imperial Dragon Restaurant? I've got a herd of you-know-whats for sale. Let me check. [He picks up Albert.] Oh, aren't you a cutie? [He puts him down and picks up the phone.] About 35lbs. [Fry taps his shoulder.] What?"
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Hi, Bender. We'd like to adopt a child."
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," Well, you've come to the right place because Honest Bender's Orphanarium means discount orphans. Now, little lady. What do I have to do to send you home with 12 orphans today?"
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," Uh, I'm afraid we only want one."
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," Whatever you say, chief. I'll show you what I got in stock."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, I remember this from when we were kids  The warden would trot you out in front of prospective parents and they'd judge you like a piece of meat.
The Cyber House Rules,Albert, I'm Albert.
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, Kind of fatty.
The Cyber House Rules,Bender, Then how about this little number? Pure-bred human. No vampire in there.
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Uh, um."
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai, Hmm.
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," If you're strapped for cash, you might wanna consider this irregular unit. [He picks up Sally, who is wearing a sash with ""As Is"" written on her.] Cursed with a third ear but so full of that emotion I understand is called ""love""."
The Cyber House Rules,Sally," One time, I did a hundred jump ropes."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Oh, I can't decide. We're gonna have to think about it."
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," OK, kids, grown-ups gotta talk now, time for bed."
The Cyber House Rules,Albert, But it's 10 in the morning!
The Cyber House Rules,Bender, I said hit the hay!
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Oh, they're all so adorable."
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," Yeah. You know, it's times like this I can hardly bear to let them go. Goodnight, you princes of Maine, you kings of New New England."
The Cyber House Rules,Smitty," You're under arrest for child cruelty, child endangerment, depriving children of food, selling children as food and misrepresenting the weight of livestock."
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," If you had kids of your own, you'd understand!"
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Officer, would it be alright if we adopted one of the kids?"
The Cyber House Rules,Smitty, Might as well. They're just gonna rot in the evidence locker.
The Cyber House Rules,Orphan #1, Nice ear!
The Cyber House Rules,Orphan #2," Hey, freaky ears!"
The Cyber House Rules,Orphan #3, How's you hearing?
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, I've made up my mind. Let's adopt her.
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai, Her? But there's plenty of normal ones.
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Come on, Adlai. She could really use a mom and dad."
The Cyber House Rules,Kids, [chanting] Ear-face! Ear-face! Sally won the ugly race!
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," On the other hand, the children bring up a good point. She does have an ear on her face."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, Well? So what? She may be different but she still deserves a good home.
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," Oh, alright. If you really want that one, I can give her an operation to make her acceptable."
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, She doesn't need an operation! She's fine the way she is!
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai," Oh, and I suppose you were fine the way you were?"
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, Damn right I was!
The Cyber House Rules,Fry, Yay!
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Shut up, Fry. Now look, Adlai. I'm proud to be different. And I just wished I'd realised that when I was her age."
The Cyber House Rules,Sally, I also have a tail!
The Cyber House Rules,Leela, Now take me to the hospital and put my eye back the way it was. Right now!
The Cyber House Rules,Adlai, Why should I do that?
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Listen, buddy. By the end of the day, one of us is gonna have one eye."
The Cyber House Rules,Vogel," In recognition of Bender's generous gift of 12 orphans and a government cheque for 1200 wing-wangs, I hereby rename this building the Bender B. Rodriguez Orphanarium!"
The Cyber House Rules,Fry, It's good to have the old weird-looking Leela back.
The Cyber House Rules,Leela," Aww! You're a true friend, Fry. I guess there's nothing wrong with being a little weird."
The Cyber House Rules,Fry," Leela, there's nothing wrong with anything."
The Cyber House Rules,Albert," We'll miss you, Daddy Bender."
The Cyber House Rules,Nina, We know robots don't have emotions but we drawed you this picture.
The Cyber House Rules,Sally," So if you ever miss us, even just a teeny bit, you can look at it."
The Cyber House Rules,Bender," Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. Sheesh! [He screws it up and throws it in his chest cabinet. The kids sigh and walk away. Bender checks they're gone and takes the screwed up paper out of his cabinet and sticks it to the inside of his door. He sighs. The kids cheer, run back and jump on him.] Hey! What the-- Get away! Come on! I just got all the gum off of there! Hey! Hey! [shouting] I hate you! I hate you all!"
The Cyber House Rules,,
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong, [from inside] Yes?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy," Hi, Dad. It's me and my co-workers."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mrs. Wong," [from inside] Open up, Leo. It's Amy and her weirdos."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mrs. Wong," Howdy, friends! Welcome to Mars!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela," Thanks so much for inviting us, Mr. Wong. I've never been to a Mars Day barbecue."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong," Oh, Mars Day much better than Earth Day. Dump trash wherever you want! Big, empty planet!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mrs. Wong," OK, then. Make yourselves at home."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zoidberg," Don't mind if I already did. By the way, do you have anymore of this Dom Perignon bubble bath? There was only enough to fill the tub halfway."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Farnsworth, This is quite a large ranch you have.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong, 17.9 billion acres. We own entire western hemisphere. [whispering] That the best hemisphere!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Farnsworth, It's the same on Earth.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong," Here is most number one product of all  The mighty buggalo. They used for everything; meat, milk and their shells make good row boat."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zoidberg, [shouting] I broke your television.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Hermes," Mon, it must take forever to brand all those cattle."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong, Not really. We own so much stuff it easier just to brand everything that not ours.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Hermes, Please don't do that.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy," Betsy! [It licks Amy. The rest of the staff gather around.] This is my sweet, little Betsy. I raised her from a larva that ate one of my sweaters."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong," Yes, everybody love Betsy. We going to eat her at Amy's wedding. If she ever get married!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy, Dad! Gleesh! Please don't say things like that when you meet my boyfriend tonight.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong," Oh, that right. We finally get to spend some time with this Mr. Kif."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mrs. Wong, I just hope he's a nice man who can make us lot of grandchildren. This not some parallel universe where you getting any younger.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp," Now remember, Kif, the quickest way to a girl's bed is through her parents. Have sex with them and you're in."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," Actually, sir, I'm-I'm a little nervous about meeting her family."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp," Well that's natural. After all you're meek and uninteresting. Until now you've gotten by on my left-over charisma, scrounging off it like a tiny charisma parasite."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif, I just hope they like me.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp," And why wouldn't they? Yes, yes, I know. Tiny, meek, uninteresting. Spare me your tedious life story, Kif. And above all have fun!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Bender," Yeah, yeah, get on down! [He scratches again.] Oh, yeah! Drop another barnyard bomb on us, Vanilla Corn!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,DJ," Yo, fool, it's Mixmaster Festus!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry," So what's Mars Day about, anyway?"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mrs. Wong," It commemorate the day centuries ago when our ancestor, Sir Reginald Wong, bought Mars from stupid natives."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela," How can you call the Native Martians ""stupid""?"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong, They sell whole planet for one bead. Sound stupid to me!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Farnsworth, That is stupid!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela," I can't believe you're laughing at the tragic exploitation of a proud, bead-loving people."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry," Lighten up, Leela. It's funny!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela, Of course it is. But you don't have to laugh!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," Amy, no! Not on your parents' planet!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,RJ," Howdy, Amy. Glad to see you've come back to the country. It's where the flavour is."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy," RJ, this is my boyfriend, Kif."
Where the Buggalo Roam,RJ," This wimp? You've gone a long way, baby. [He takes out a cigarette box.] Cigarette, partner?"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," Oh, I don't--"
Where the Buggalo Roam,RJ, I haven't even lit it yet!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif, Oh. Is it lit now?
Where the Buggalo Roam,RJ, Yep. [Kif coughs and spits the cigarette out. RJ catches it and smokes it.] You're pathetic!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zoidberg, Host-man! Host-woman! I'm having a wonderful time!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong," You here five hours and already you tear up couch, draw moustache on priceless painting and fill pool with brine shrimp."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zoidberg," [nudging Mrs. Wong] Not bad for a city boy, huh? [Mr. Wong takes a bite of caviar.] By the way, I took the liberty of fertilising your caviar."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy, Just relax. I'm sure my parents will love you.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," You don't understand. When I get nervous, I can't control my camouflage reflex. [He turns transparent.] Oh, dear! [He paces.] Oh, goodness! Oh, odds and bodkins!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry, I'll have a thorax and some feelers.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong, You want some salad with that?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry, Yuck!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy, Mom? Dad? You remember Kif?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong, This your boyfriend? I have instant dislike of him!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mrs. Wong, He too scrawny to father grandchildren.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy," He's not scrawny, he's just small-boned."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," Actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders that--"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong," Yes, yes! You a big squishy wuss! Amy should be dating real man. Like him!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," I can be manly too. I think I'll, uh, light up a smoke."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy, [whispering] Wrong way!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif, [wheezy] Smooth!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy, Look on the bright side  My parents left after you passed out so they didn't even see you barf.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," Oh, now they'll never think I'm manly enough to date their daughter."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy," It's OK, Kif. [Kif whimpers.] I'll go get you a tissue from your tote."
Where the Buggalo Roam,RJ," Hey there, Amy. Like you to meet my buddy, Joe."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Joe, Sorry I'm late. My pool game ran long at the jazz club!
Where the Buggalo Roam,RJ, Kids love him!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry, What's that weird sound?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong," Dust storm! Oh, dust storm! Everybody into house. Hurry, before we die. And wipe your damn feet!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mrs. Wong, Phew! Everyone OK? No one considering lawsuit?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Farnsworth, Hmm. I might have mental anguish.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong, I'll have you know I'm friends with every judge on planet.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Farnsworth, I'm OK then.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mrs. Wong," Storm dying down. Leo, check if buggalo herd is OK."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong, Oh!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela, What happened to the buggalo?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong, They been rustled under cover of storm. We ruined!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zoidberg, [screaming] Nooo!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy," Don't worry, Daddy. It'll be OK."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong," Oh, really? Who gonna save us? [He points at Leela.] One-eye? [He points at Zoidberg.] Lobster mooch? [He points at Bender.] Drunken garbage can?"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Hermes, This sounds like a job for--
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif, Lieutenant Kif Kroker!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Hermes, Alright then.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong," Aye-ah! Those buggalo are what made Wong family so rich and powerful. Oh, Inez, with them stolen, we ruined!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mrs. Wong, OK. I want a divorce.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zoidberg, Mom! Dad! Don't ask me to choose!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy," They're not your parents, I'm not your sister and that's not your golf cart."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zoidberg, Aw!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy, Everybody just calm down. Kif promised he'd catch the rustlers.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," Mrs. Wong, do you have a neckerchief I could borrow?"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," My plan is to take all the remaining buggalo and lead them on a rough, tough cattle drive. Then, when the rustlers attack, I'll make a citizen's arrest!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Farnsworth," It sounds dangerous. Someone could get killed. Fry, Leela, Bender, I want you to go with him."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry," Aw, man!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Wong. I'll get your cattle back or die trying."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong," Hey, we can't lose!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy," No, Kif! It's too risky. You don't have to do this to prove your manliness."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mrs. Wong," Oh, yes he does!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,RJ, Here are your mounts!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela, She's got a fine coat.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," Now, we need buggalo to lure the rustlers. How many are left?"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy," You're lookin' at her. Betsy's the only one left. She was curled up in my hamper when the storm hit. [Betsy leaps onto Kif.] Aw, she likes you!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," Saddle up, men. We got some no good rustlers to ... catch!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Bender," [singing]   We've got a right to pick a little fight with rustlers,"
Where the Buggalo Roam,"Somebody wants to pick a fight with us,",
Where the Buggalo Roam,He'd better bite my ass!,
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry, Yee-haw!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela," Wow, look at that  Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the solar system."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry, Where?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela, Right in front of you.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry, Oh. Oh!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif, We'll camp near the top. The rustlers will be sure to spot us there.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry, Where?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Bender," And even though the computer was off and unplugged, an image stayed on the screen. It was ... the Windows logo!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry," Pft, that's not scary!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Bender, It is if you're a laser printer.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela," OK, my turn to tell a ghost story. Once, there was this woman driving--"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry, Hook on the hand!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," OK, I've got one. This family--"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry, Man in the attic!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela," Fine, Mr. Know-It-All-About-Something-Finally, you tell a story!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry," With pleasure. [spookily] Once, not far from here, four people set out on a cattle drive--"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Bender," [speaking fast] Robot gets bored and kills Fry with a hammer! [normal] Sorry, go on."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry," And then, while they sat helplessly around the campfire ... a demented knife-wielding escaped lunatic libertarian zombie mutant snuck up and--"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy, [from bushes] Surprise!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif, Amy? What are you doing here?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy, I forgot to give you something before you left.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif, What?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy, Is that your camouflage reflex or are you just happy to see me?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," I love it out here, Amy. I feel so manly. I have a blister, I-I spit! A-And of course, I tell no one my feelings."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy," But you still have them, right?"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," Oh, yes. But I keep them inside until I can write them in my diary."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy," Ah, it's a wonderful night."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif, It sure is. I could just lie here beside you staring at the sky all night.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy, I can't! [She kisses him and the ground shakes.] What's that?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif, Maybe we just made love.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy, The buggalo! They're in the crater.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," The rustlers must have seen me coming and run off, scared."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy," Oh, Kif! You're so brave!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif, [nervous] Sh! They'll hear us!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," OK, the dynamite's in place."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy, Are you sure there's no other way to get the buggalo out?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela, Not unless your parents have thousands of helicopters at their disposal.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy," Well, actually--"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Bender, Too late! This is more fun!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy, Kif! You did it! But how did you know the dynamite would work?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif, I once took a seminar in ejecting chickens from a sand dune. The principle is essentially the same.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry," Hey, it's that ""barbecue's over"" sound again."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela, [shouting] Sandstorm! [The tornado picks up the buggalo and them. They tumble around inside the tornado and then fall to the ground.] We're in the eye of the storm!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry, Where?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Bender, What's that?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry, My God!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela, Who are they?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Singing Wind, Fehk! We are the Native Martians.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry," Also, I didn't know buggalo could fly."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Singing Wind, Only those who revere Mother Mars can fly buggalo. And only they shall have buggalo. And they're us.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," But your, um, Martian-ness, these buggalo aren't yours. They belong to the Wong family."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Singing Wind, You mean family that took all Martian land and gave us one lousy bead?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy, Uh-huh! Amy Wong. [She holds out her hand.] And you are?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Singing Wind, Mad at Wong family! We plan to ruin them by stealing buggalo. But now we take girl instead.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy, Wait! I'm too rich to be kidnapped!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif, Amy! Nooo!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Bender," Don't worry, Kif. I'm sure some other beautiful, rich girl will fall in love with you."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong, Hooray! You bring back cattle.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif, Yes ... but ... I'm afraid I've got some bad news as well.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mrs. Wong, Let Amy tell us. That way it soften the blow. [There is silence.] Why Amy being so quiet?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," Um ... well, um ... that is, um..."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong," Oh, no! Martians kidnap Amy! [Inside it says ""We Take Daughter. Us Want Land"" and there is a picture of Amy blindfolded, holding today's newspaper.] I know it them 'cause they no use good grammar."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," I'll get your daughter back, sir. I swear."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong," Forget it, squishy. You the one lose her in first place. You done enough."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mrs. Wong, Yeah. This time we get most decorated law man in the whole universe!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," You mean-- Oh, no, please. I beg you! Oh, for the love of--"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp," I am the man with no name. Zapp Brannigan, at your service!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mrs. Wong," Please, Mr. Brannigan, we need you go get our daughter back."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp, Very well. I'll clean up Kif's mess. I shall go bargain with the Martian's personally. [The Wongs gasp.] Your gasps intrigue me. Explain.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong, Martians have no land. They been gently encouraged to live on reservation deep underground. No one ever dare go there.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Farnsworth," This mission is incredibly dangerous. Someone's sure to be killed. Fry, Leela, Bender--"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Bender," Damn you, old man!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela," Aw, look. Betsy followed you, Kif!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp," I didn't realise you were bringing your girlfriend, lieutenant!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif, She won't leave me alone.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp," Did I say ""girlfriend""? She sounds more like a wife!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp, Behold  The Great Stone Face of Mars.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry, Hm.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp, The only known entrance to the Martian reservation.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela, What about the Great Stone Ass of Mars?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp," Well, yeah, but it's way over the other side of the planet."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp," Nose-ward, ho!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Singing Wind," Fehk! I am Singing Wind, chief of the Martian tribe."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp, Take me to your leader.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Singing Wind, Moving along. Why you trespass on our land?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp, We come to negotiate the release of Amy Wong. And just to clarify  Land is the stuff that has sky over it.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela, They have such respect for the planet.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Martian #1, Cynthia used to drink Slurm.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Singing Wind, We will give back girl when we get back planet surface.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp, How do we even know she's alive?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy, I'm fine.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp, Sh! You're weakening our bargaining position. How about instead you give us the girl and we carve a bunch of our presidents into your sacred mountain?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Singing Wind, You waste words. We want return of land that was taken from us.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Bender," Uh, actually you traded it for a bead."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Singing Wind, Tribe suffer heap big buyer's remorse. We want land back!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp," Chief, my people are a people of law. And that law is ... [He pulls out a gun.] ... no backsies!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Singing Wind, The time for stupid statements is over!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp," Oh, boy!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela," Ow, ow, ow, ow! My eye!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zoidberg, [from inside] Ma! Pa! Our precious ranch!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," Amy, no! It's too windy! [Betsy nudges him and Kif smiles. Amy screams as the tornado lifts her higher.] Stay calm, dearest! I'll save you!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy, Kif! [She gasps.] You're flying Betsy!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif, Need a lift?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Singing Wind, Great Mother Mars! He has the gift!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela," Yay, Kif!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp," Kroker, that was one Brannigan-esque feat of heroism!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Singing Wind," We have misjudged you, green one. You fly the buggalo like us. You have true reverence for Mother Mars. Let there be peace between us."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Martian #2, Yes. Let us smoke-em peace pipe.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif, Smoke-em?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Singing Wind," Here, take."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," Ooh, no thanks. I'm on the peace patch."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Singing Wind," You must smoke peace pipe, and you must do it peacefully. Or we'll kill you."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," Well, it's just really that I don't feel that--"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp," Don't be such a chicken, Kif. Teenagers all smoke and they seem pretty on-the-ball."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry, Yeah!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp," Yes, sir!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Bender, Way to suck it!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," Hey, I'm smoking! I'm the greatest! [He takes another puff. Singing Wind pats him on the back. Kif coughs and splutters and the Martians gasp.] Oh, monkey trumpets!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Singing Wind, You have coughed at our offer of peace. So you must die!
Where the Buggalo Roam,Martian #3, The very bead used to crush our dreams shall be used to crush your bones.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," Well, actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders that--"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Fry, Wait. That's the bead you traded your land for?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela, It's a gigantic diamond! That thing must be worth a fortune.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Singing Wind, Really?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Bender," Oh, Chief, you've made me the happiest girl in the world!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy," Y'know, if you still want your land, we could just trade back for it."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Singing Wind, Hmm. We always thought bead was worthless. We assumed our ancestors were cheated because they not have concept of ownership.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Bender, So we can have the diamond?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Singing Wind, No. We do have concept of ownership. You are free to go. Sorry about all the rustling and kidnapping.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Leela, But what about your sacred land?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Singing Wind," Land shmand! We don't wanna live on this planet. It's a dump. We'll buy new planet and act like it's sacred. With cash like this, who's going to argue? Nobody, that's who!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy," Then Kif flew Betsy, rescued me from the tornado and made peace with the Martians."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mr. Wong, Please! He too much of a wimp.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Mrs. Wong, Yeah. I'm sure it was all Mr. Zapp Brannigan here.
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zapp," Please, you give me too little credit."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zoidberg," Captain Brannigan, you're always welcome here at Rancho Zoidberg!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Zoidberg," Money doesn't make good people, no, siree!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy," Thanks for saving my life, Kif. You're my hero."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," Oh, you're kind. But your parents still don't like me."
Where the Buggalo Roam,Amy, Well globviously! But if they liked you then I wouldn't. Don't you know anything about girls?
Where the Buggalo Roam,Kif," [writing] Dear diary, I just made love for the second time!"
Where the Buggalo Roam,,
Insane in the Mainframe,Announcer, [voice-over] Futurama is brought to you by ... [The oval retreats the right side of the screen and is replaced by a man with enormous teeth.] ... Thompson's Teeth  The only teeth strong enough to eat other teeth.
Insane in the Mainframe,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Today marks our dear friend Dr. Zoidberg's 10th year with Planet Express. Huzzahs are in order."
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, [unenthusiastic] Huzzah!
Insane in the Mainframe,Leela, [unenthusiastic] Huzzah!
Insane in the Mainframe,Amy, [unenthusiastic] Huzzah!
Insane in the Mainframe,Zoidberg, Hooray for me! Hooray for Zoidberg!
Insane in the Mainframe,Hermes," I will now read the mandatory speech. [He opens a book called ""Minimum Obligations Manual"".] [reading] Dear employee. Has it really been five, 10 or 15 years? If not, please disregard this and get back to work. Distribute token of appreciation and applaud."
Insane in the Mainframe,Zoidberg," Look! Coupons! I can get two oil changes for the price of one! Now if I could only afford the one ... and the car. Ah, the years! So many memories, so many strange fluids gushing out of patients' bodies--"
Insane in the Mainframe,Hermes," Yes, yes. Now here's your pension statement. [He hands Zoidberg a piece of paper. Zoidberg reads it. He has accumulated a grand total of $0.00.] It's empty because you haven't paid into it, you dumb stinkbug!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Zoidberg, You kept track of it all these years!
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," Oh, no, I'm boned! I haven't paid into the pension either. What'll I do when I retire?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender, I thought you were retired.
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," Hey, I don't see you planning for your old age."
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," I got plans. I'm gonna turn my on/off switch to ""off""."
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, Well I'm gonna take action. It's time to check on my retirement fund. [He takes a $100 bill out of his sock.] Damn! Still only $100.
Insane in the Mainframe,Franklin," [on bill] A penny saved is a penny earned. Also, could you get some athlete's foot cream for my face?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, He's right! I've gotta start investing wisely.
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," Well, I'm down to my last lottery ticket. [He scratches a panel on the ""Whiff-n-Win"" ticket.] Cherry. [Another panel.] Cherry! [The last one.] Mule. Crud!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," So, you got six bucks left to retire on. I recommend Tender Vittles."
Insane in the Mainframe,Teller, You're opening a retirement account for $6? I'm sure a wealthy ... [She sniffs.] ... mule farmer like yourself is aware that we charge a $10 monthly fee.
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, [shrugging] You gotta spend money to make money.
Insane in the Mainframe,Teller," Here you are, sir. Your account is now overdrawn by $4."
Insane in the Mainframe,Robot," Gee, I've seen lines move faster in a sperm bank."
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender, That's for sure-- [He turns around.] Roberto! Is that you?
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto," Bender! Hey, man!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender, You old lunatic! How you been?
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto," Not bad, not bad. [He pulls out a knife.] Everybody on the floor! This is a stick-up!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," Yeah, I'm doing OK too. [The teller hands Roberto several bags of money.] I'm taking a Chinese cooking class at the Learning Annex."
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto, Cool. Ca-Can you give me a hand here?
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," Sure thing, pal."
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto," Hey, you! Red! [He cuts the top off the plant.] Quit watering that plant and get the door!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," Well, nice talking to you."
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto, Same here. [He takes the money from Bender and puts his arms around their shoulders.] You guys are alright! Here's something for your trouble.
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," Hey, thanks, buddy!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Smitty," Freeze, punks! You're under arrest!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Nixon, [on $1000 bill] Shoot them in the back! Quick! While they're not looking!
Insane in the Mainframe,Bailiff, Court is in session. The Honourable Judge Whitey presiding.
Insane in the Mainframe,Whitey," The charge is bank robbery. Now, my caddie chauffeur informs me that a bank is a place where people put money that isn't properly invested. Therefore, robbing a bank is tantamount to that most heinous of crimes, theft of money."
Insane in the Mainframe,Hyper-Chicken," As the surveillance camera for the bank what all the judge was a-jawing about, could y'all tell us what you done seen the day of the crime?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Camera," Well, let's see. My memory's a little fuzzy, but it went exactly like this "
Insane in the Mainframe,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour, I move that I be disbarred for introducing this evidence against my own clients."
Insane in the Mainframe,Hyper-Chicken," Mr. Fry, do you recognise the robot a-huggin' on you in this here hologram?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, I sure do! That's the real robber and I'll never forget his name as long as I live. And that name is--
Insane in the Mainframe,Leela, [shouting] Fry! Just give a name. You don't wanna look stupid on Court TV!
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, You're right. You're right. It was--
Insane in the Mainframe,Whitey, Yes? What? You say if I testify I'll be killed? Oh. It's for you.
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto, [on phone] ...and the other hamburger will...
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto," ...also be made of your lungs. So long, pal."
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, I refuse to testify on the grounds that my organs will be chopped up into a patty.
Insane in the Mainframe,Whitey," Ah, the 67th Amendment."
Insane in the Mainframe,Hyper-Chicken, I may be a simple country Hyper-Chicken but I know when we're finger-licked. Whattya say we plead insanity?
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender, A few months in an insane asylum? I could do that standing on my head.
Insane in the Mainframe,Hyper-Chicken," If you start now, it might help our case."
Insane in the Mainframe,Whitey," Counselor, what evidence do you offer to support this new plea of insanity?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Hyper-Chicken," Well, for one, they done hired me to represent them."
Insane in the Mainframe,Whitey," Insanity plea is accepted. Mr. Bender, I hereby commit you to the asylum for criminally insane robots until such time as you are deemed cured."
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender, Yahoo! The system fails again!
Insane in the Mainframe,Whitey," And, Mr. Fry, I sentence you to the home for criminally insane humans."
Insane in the Mainframe,Bailiff," Your Honour, that facility has been full ever since you ruled that being poor is a mental illness."
Insane in the Mainframe,Whitey, [banging gavel] Order! Order! The only poor people I want to hear about are the people who tend to my pores at the spa. Just send them both to the robot loony bin and let's go.
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, [from box] Ow! My head! Ow! My feet! Ow! My head! Ow! My feet!
Insane in the Mainframe,Farnsworth, Keep your chin up!
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, [from box] Ow! My chin!
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," I don't belong here, Bender. This is an asylum for insane robots!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," Well, you meet half the qualifications."
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," Oh, good, a physical! Once they examine my fragile, naked, pink body, they'll see I'm not a--"
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, What the--
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender, [shouting] I find that offensive!
Insane in the Mainframe,Dr. Perceptron, Greetings. I am Dr. Perceptron. Let me give you something to help you relax.
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," Look! There's been a terrible mistake. I'm a human being. See? [He lifts up his gown and grabs his belly.] I'm all squishy and flabby. Also, I complain a lot."
Insane in the Mainframe,Dr. Perceptron," Yes, you do. You need to relax more. [He gives Fry another shock.] Terrific. Now, consider the following  You were admitted to this robot asylum. Therefore, you must be a robot. Diagnosis complete."
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, I do other human stuff! I age! See?
Insane in the Mainframe,Nurse Ratchet," I'm Nurse Ratchet. Please come with me, won't you?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Nurse Ratchet," We'll meet your roommate next, shall we? His name is Malfunctioning Eddie."
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, The car dealer? Wow! I guess his prices really were insane.
Insane in the Mainframe,Nurse Ratchet, He's very excitable. [She takes the straight jacket off him and presses the open button on the door.] So don't say anything to surprise him.
Insane in the Mainframe,Malfunctioning Eddie, Pleased to meet you.
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," [shaking his hand] Actually, we've met once before."
Insane in the Mainframe,Malfunctioning Eddie, What?
Insane in the Mainframe,Hairbot, I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl.
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender, Whoa! Someone had a busy day.
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," My roommate exploded. Oh, you gotta help me, Bender. How can I prove I'm human?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender, You could drop dead. That'd show 'em.
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, I don't wanna!
Insane in the Mainframe,Unit 2013," Hey, man. I believe you're a human."
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, You do?
Insane in the Mainframe,Unit 2013," Sure. They don't believe I'm a human either. Name's Unit 2013. C'mon. Lemme introduce you around. [He takes Fry to a robot.] Fry, meet Norm. How's it going, pal? Still picking up transmissions from the CIA on your teeth?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Norm, They just won't stop!
Insane in the Mainframe,Woman," [on radio] The CIA cafeteria menu for the week of May 15th is as follows  Monday, shepherd's pie. Tu--"
Insane in the Mainframe,Unit 2013," [making ""cuckoo"" gesture] Cuckoo!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," Let me guess, he thinks he's Lincoln?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Unit 2013," Well, he's supposed to. Problem is he's got multiple personalities -- all of them Lincoln."
Insane in the Mainframe,Lincolnbot, I was born in 200 log cabins.
Insane in the Mainframe,Unit 2013," And this here is Frankie. He's convinced he's a lunchroom worker, so they put him to work in the lunchroom. [patronising] How is work in the lunchroom, Frankie?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Frankie, [shrugging] It's alright.
Insane in the Mainframe,Unit 2013, Poor Frankie!
Insane in the Mainframe,Mad Hatterbot, Change places!
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," Bender, I can't take much more of this! I want outta here!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," Are you crazy? This place is great! Electroshock whenever you want it, two Lincolns for every Napoleon. [He sips some oil.] Ah! Sweet light crude!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, But I'm not a robot like you. I don't like having discs crammed into me. Unless they're Oreos -- and then only in the mouth! Don't you understand? I'm gonna die here!
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," Ah, quit your bellyaching and take it like a robot."
Insane in the Mainframe,Mad Hatterbot, Change places!
Insane in the Mainframe,Victor, The doctor says you are making great strides with your exploding problem.
Insane in the Mainframe,Malfunctioning Eddie," Well, the way I see it--"
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, You gotta get me out of here. I would have starved to death if not for that sick vending machine robot. [The Pay 'n' Chew robot coughs and a Bachelor Bar falls onto the floor.] Gimme! Gimme!
Insane in the Mainframe,Hermes, Poor Fry! He's got the munchies for freedom!
Insane in the Mainframe,Leela, We're all trying to help you. We've petitioned the governor but he doesn't want to appear soft on people who've been falsely imprisoned.
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, At least I have friends on the outside. Bender's been no help at all.
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," Je suis Napoleon! [He laughs.] No, seriously, I'm not."
Insane in the Mainframe,Amy, Bender! You should be more ashamed of yourself than usual.
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," Ah, lighten up, honey. I'm just trying to get through a difficult time using humour."
Insane in the Mainframe,Nurse Ratchet, Visiting hours are over. Time for our medication disks.
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," [shouting] Help me! For God's sake, help me!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Farnsworth," Oh, don't worry, Fry. I too once spent a nightmare-ish time in a robot asylum. But now it's nearly over. So long."
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," [sleep-talking] Thirty days hath September, April, June and ... wonder ... is that peanut butter ... what am I gonna do? [He hears a whirring outside and wakes up.] [talking] Oh, God! What? What? What is it now?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Dr. Perceptron, You are being released.
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," Finally! Sweet justice! Sweet, juicy justice!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Dr. Perceptron, Not you. Him.
Insane in the Mainframe,Malfunctioning Eddie, Me? What a surprise. [Fry flinches. There is a tiny explosion on Eddie's shoulder.] Look!
Insane in the Mainframe,Malfunctioning Eddie, I barely exploded at all.
Insane in the Mainframe,Dr. Perceptron, We can control that with medication.
Insane in the Mainframe,Nurse Ratchet, Fry? Are we ready to meet our new roommate?
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto," Hi, Red!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, Roberto! W-W-W-What are you doing here?
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto, I got busted robbing that bank again.
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, [shaking] Why would you hold up the same bank twice?
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto," Ah, that first time was just to case the joint and rob it a little. [He sees Fry shaking.] What's the matter? You scared?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, N-- N-- N--
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto," Noticeably? I'll say! Now stand back, I gotta practise my stabbing."
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, No! Please! Help! Stop it! Please!
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender, [shouting; from cell] Hey! Keep it down in there! I'm tuning my banjo!
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto," Jeez, Red. Quit cowering. You call yourself a robot?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, I'm not a robot! [shouting] I'm not a robot!
Insane in the Mainframe,Dr. Perceptron," In answer to your question, Hermes, yes, your friend is cured."
Insane in the Mainframe,Hermes, Oh!
Insane in the Mainframe,Farnsworth, What a relief!
Insane in the Mainframe,Leela, Thank God!
Insane in the Mainframe,Dr. Perceptron, You'll notice he no longer suffers delusions of humanity.
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," [mechanical voice] Affirmative. I feel nothing. I am a robot. Beep, beep, beep ..."
Insane in the Mainframe,Leela," You've made a terrible mistake. He's a human being, not a machine. Oh, Fry!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," [singing] Gonna sing a little tale about a battle called Waterloo. [talking] Bonjour, y'all!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Zoidberg," Listen to me, Fry. Just because you think you're a robot, doesn't make you a robot. After all, I think I'm a doctor but that doesn't make me a doctor. These fancy clothes do!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, [mechanical voice] Negative. I must be a robot. Why else would human women refuse to date me?
Insane in the Mainframe,Leela," Oh, lots of reasons."
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," [mechanical voice] Bio-units, terminate noise exchange. It is time for you to ingest sandwiches from my compartment."
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender, Here we go. Just a minute. Aha!
Insane in the Mainframe,Commentator," [on radio] And down the stretch, it's Daddy's Little Grandpa, followed by Perennial Loser, and bringing up the rear, it's Lasty!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," Come on, Lasty!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto," Hey, Bender."
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," Roberto! Ooh, what a surprise to see you in here! Especially 'cause I didn't squeal on you, remember? Remember all that squealing I didn't do? Remember? Do you?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto," Yeah, yeah. Now lie down and play dead. And don't ham it up!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," Uh, sure. [He jumps on. Roberto covers his body with a sheet.] Anything for you, buddy."
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto," Wait here, Bender. I need to get a disguise."
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," Uh, what's with the get-up?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto, I'm in disguise 'cause I'm thinking of escaping. You in? Or do I gotta kill you so you don't squeal?
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender, I'm in! I'm in! [He laughs nervously.] So when were you planning the breakout?
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto, I'm thinking maybe a few seconds ago.
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender, Quick! Let's keep escaping!
Insane in the Mainframe,Hermes," Times two, carry the one..."
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," Oh, you sad, worthless human."
Insane in the Mainframe,Hermes, What are ya-- Sacred hog of Prague! That was my anniversary gift to LaBarbara!
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, Fear not! For I shall assist ye!
Insane in the Mainframe,Hermes," Robots don't say ""ye""!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," Relax, mammal. My robotic software shall meet your calculatory needs. [He looks at the paperwork.] What is the meaning of this symbol?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Hermes," That's a plus sign, you pointy-haired loony! Quit thinking you're a robot!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, I'll show ye!
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, Stand back. I'm a tool-bot.
Insane in the Mainframe,Leela, You're not a tool-bot. You're not a food-motron. You're not a robot of any kind.
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," Yes, I am. I simply haven't discovered my primary function yet."
Insane in the Mainframe,Leela," OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can."
Insane in the Mainframe,Farnsworth, You're going to do his laundry?
Insane in the Mainframe,Leela," [sexfully] Fry, this is for you."
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, Beep.
Insane in the Mainframe,Leela," Oh, for God's sake!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Zoidberg," By a scallop's forelocks! What's with all the beer, Fry?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," [drunk] Alcohol fuels my power cells. [He stands up.] And as a mighty robot, I-- [He burps and falls back onto the couch, tipping it over backwards.] Beep."
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto," Thanks for helping me escape, Bender."
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," Oh, it was nothing."
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto, [shouting] It was not nothing! [talking] I wanna repay you. Let me get you something in here.
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto, [shouting] Hands up! This is a stick-up again!
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," Wow! Hitting the same place three times? I admire your style, Roberto."
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto, Gimme the remaining dough. And the calendars ... and that pen. Try to tear it so most of the beads are on my end!
Insane in the Mainframe,URL, Police! You're busted!
Insane in the Mainframe,Smitty, And don't try anything. This glass here is laser-proof. [Roberto puts his arm through the glass and waves his knife around.] Fire lasers! [They do and the laser bolts bounce off the glass.] Duck! Lasers!
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender, Come on! I got a place where I like to hide after crimes.
Insane in the Mainframe,Amy, Aw! He looks like a little insane drunken angel.
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," [panting] Hey, everybody. Meet my good pal, Roberto."
Insane in the Mainframe,Hermes," Hey, mon."
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto, Nice to meet you.
Insane in the Mainframe,Smitty, [on megaphone; from outside] Come out with your hands up.
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto, [shouting] Hostages!
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto, Back off! I got hostages!
Insane in the Mainframe,Zoidberg, Hooray! I'm helping!
Insane in the Mainframe,Smitty, [on megaphone] Do you have any better hostages?
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto," To show them who's crazy, I'm gonna execute some of you. How 'bout you?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Farnsworth, Ouch! That's going to bleed when my heart beats.
Insane in the Mainframe,Leela, Wait! Take me first!
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender, Yes! Take her first.
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto, Shut up! Stop telling me how to do this!
Insane in the Mainframe,Zoidberg," Oh, the fear!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto, I'm thinking of a number between one and ten. Guess it and you die first. Go!
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender, Um ... OK. Fifty ... six ... ish?
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto," 56? 56? Oh, man! Now that's all I can think about! I'm gonna kill you, you ... no good ... 56-ing--"
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender, Don't kill me yet! I'm starting to come down with Stockholm Syndrome ... handsome!
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," Halt, fellow robot!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto," Hey, Red. You're just in time to join the hostage situation. Which side you wanna be on?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," The side that kicks your twisted, metal ass!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Leela, Fry! Stay back. He's too powerful.
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," Negative, bossy meat creature. I know now what my primary function is  I am a battle-droid. Sworn to protect the weak from crazy robots."
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto, I'm not crazy! Don't call me crazy! I'm just not user-friendly!
Insane in the Mainframe,Hermes, Fry! Don't be a hero! It's not covered by the health plan!
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto, Let's see how much of a robot you really are!
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, No knife can penetrate my skin-tanium armour.
Insane in the Mainframe,Roberto," Help! Help! He is a battle-droid! Somebody help me! Mommy! I'm sorry I spilled the transmission fluid, Mommy! No! No! Don't weld me to the wall, Mommy!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Smitty, [on megaphone] We're willing to listen to your demands.
Insane in the Mainframe,URL," Hey, baby. Wash that off before you put it back."
Insane in the Mainframe,Hermes, Who's brave now?
Insane in the Mainframe,Amy, Hooray!
Insane in the Mainframe,Zoidberg, Bravo!
Insane in the Mainframe,Leela," You did it, Fry."
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," Congratulations, buddy. You're a credit to my race."
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," [mechanical voice] It was nothing. I-- [He sees his bleeding arm and screams. His wipes some onto his finger and looks at it.] [normal] Blood? Robots don't have blood. I must be a, a--"
Insane in the Mainframe,Zoidberg, A squid?
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," A human! Oh, my God! I'm a human!"
Insane in the Mainframe,Zoidberg, Also good.
Insane in the Mainframe,Leela," Thanks for saving us, Fry."
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry, I'm gonna continue never washing this cheek again.
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," Buddy, you may be wrapped in greasy skin, but inside, you've got the heart of a robot."
Insane in the Mainframe,Fry," Aw. Thanks, Bender."
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender," Just like inside me, I've got the heart of a human. [He takes one out and everyone gasps and cringes.] What?"
Insane in the Mainframe,Bender, [over credits] What?
Insane in the Mainframe,,
The Route of All Evil,Bender," Ah, beer! So many choices, and it makes so little difference."
The Route of All Evil,Fry, How 'bout Löbrau? It has dots on it.
The Route of All Evil,Bender, Overruled. The choice of champions is Pabst Blue Robot!
The Route of All Evil,Fry, I can't drink that! The metal shavings make my throat bloody.
The Route of All Evil,Bender, Baby wants a Zima!
The Route of All Evil,Leela," Hey, hey! We can all fight when we're drunk. Now, listen, why don't we just brew our own beer?"
The Route of All Evil,Bender, You can brew your own beer?
The Route of All Evil,Leela, Sure. The kids at the orphanarium used to do it all the time.
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," Cursed bacteria of Liberia. My own son, suspended from boarding school."
The Route of All Evil,Dwight," It's not my fault, Dad."
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," And you, Cubert! I cloned you from one of my warts and I can send you straight back in there."
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, Nuh-uh!
The Route of All Evil,Zoidberg, What's going on? Is this angry yelling or busted-hearing-aid yelling?
The Route of All Evil,Hermes, I'm afraid it's both.
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth, [shouting] What?
The Route of All Evil,LaBarbara," Now hold on. Everyone, cool your daiquiris! Let's give the little vermin a chance to explain themselves."
The Route of All Evil,Dwight," It was self defence, Mom. Just look at this letter the principal sent. [He puts the letter in a machine. Cubert's and Dwight's classroom appears on the TV.] We were in science class and we had just finished building a miniature black hole."
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, [on TV] That was easy.
The Route of All Evil,Bret, [on TV] Pretty scrawny black hole. It must be hungry.
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, [on TV] Duh! Black holes don't need food.
The Route of All Evil,Bret, [on TV] Neither do nerds!
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, [on TV] My Manwich!
The Route of All Evil,Cubert," [on TV] That's it, Bret. You've compressed our lunches to a singularity for the last time! Salt him, Dwight!"
The Route of All Evil,Bret," [on TV] When I re-solidify, I'm gonna put you in a world of goop!"
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, See? That bully started it. We couldn't fight back with brawn so we used our brains!
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth, I've warned you not to use those things!
The Route of All Evil,Leela," Let's see. We've got our malt, our hops. We just need a big disposable tub to mix it in."
The Route of All Evil,Bender, Yo!
The Route of All Evil,Leela, Now it needs to boil for a couple hours.
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," Dwight, you remember the crew."
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, [unenthusiastic] Eh.
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," Crew, you remember Cubert? [The crew respond without enthusiasm.] Wonderful! Then I'm sure you won't mind being their legal guardians for a month!"
The Route of All Evil,Cubert," Well, well. [He looks at Leela.] If it isn't my old friend, stretch pants ... [He looks at Bender.] ... no pants and ... [He looks at Fry.] ... idiot!"
The Route of All Evil,Bender, We're making beer. I'm the brewery.
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, I heard alcohol makes you stupid.
The Route of All Evil,Fry, No I'm ... doesn't.
The Route of All Evil,Leela," Actually, Dwight, you're right. Alcohol is very, very bad ... for children. But once you turn 21 it becomes very, very good. So scram!"
The Route of All Evil,Dwight," Aw, man!"
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, I'm sick of this.
The Route of All Evil,Cubert," Hey, Dad. What useless contraption are you half-baking today?"
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," Eh, wha? Oh! This is my latest invention; a device that lets anyone sound exactly like me!"
The Route of All Evil,Cubert," [Farnsworth's voice] Good news, everyone! I'm a horse's butt!"
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," I am? That's not good news at all, you little--"
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, What's this devices marketability? Who's the target consumer?
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," There is no target consumer! Only targets. Targets that will tremble in fear as their new master hands down edicts in my glorious, booming voice! [He speaks through the machine and there is feedback.] Now quit pestering me, you scoundrels!"
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," [singing] Stamp it, file it. Oh, yeah! Send it overnight!"
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, Can I collate that?
The Route of All Evil,Hermes, No!
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, Can I shred these contracts?
The Route of All Evil,Hermes, No!
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, Wow! A power-stamper!
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," Now look at all the work I gotta do! [He stamps ""void"" stamps over the ""tax-exempts"" all over the room. He stamps his head.] Ow!"
The Route of All Evil,Leela, Mmm. The ingredients are cooked. And they've picked up some of your natural robot flavourings. Time to add the yeast.
The Route of All Evil,Bender, Yeast? You mean I'll have a lifeform growing inside me? [crying] It's so beautiful.
The Route of All Evil,Leela, Talk to me.
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," [on communicator] This is Professor Farnsworth. I have an important delivery for you and your dumb crew. You must deliver a pizza to Dogdoo 8, a planet at the edge of the universe."
The Route of All Evil,Cubert," [Farnsworth's voice] Sorry I can't come down to say goodbye, but I'm busy inventing useless junk."
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, [Farnsworth's voice] And I smell bad.
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, Hey!
The Route of All Evil,Leela," If you were my kids, you'd get quite a talking to ... from your father ... when he got home from the Senate."
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," Oh, bother! What have they done now?"
The Route of All Evil,Bender, Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake pizza delivery.
The Route of All Evil,Fry, The address was on Dogdoo 8 but the universe ends right after Dogdoo 7.
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," Child man, is this true?"
The Route of All Evil,Dwight," Yeah, but why are you mad at us? Your dummy brigade wasted a week on an obviously fake mission."
The Route of All Evil,Cubert," [pointing at Bender] Plus, they're making bootleg beer inside company property!"
The Route of All Evil,Bender, [shouting] Lies! Lies and slander!
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth, Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed? That's the last straw! You boys have been underfoot long enough!
The Route of All Evil,Hermes, You jerked the words right outta my mouth. We're their fathers and it's high times we acted like it.
The Route of All Evil,Bender, Ooh-hoo! Here comes violence!
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," Get a job, you lazy kids!"
The Route of All Evil,Bender, I guess if you want children beaten ... [He pulls out a blernsball bat.] ... you have to do it yourself.
The Route of All Evil,Cubert," Come on, Dad, shuffle faster!"
The Route of All Evil,Dwight," You don't wanna miss the unveiling of our new company, do you?"
The Route of All Evil,Hermes, Company? [He laughs.] How cute! What will you be pedalling? Lemonade? Shoe shines? Cootie insurance?
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth, Perhaps they've constructed a teddy bear hospital!
The Route of All Evil,Cubert," Actually, we're starting a competing delivery company."
The Route of All Evil,Hermes, Welcome to the world of business!
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," Who's going to use a delivery service with a kicked sign? Nobody, that's who!"
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, But we already have a client signed up. We're delivering the Daily Supernova.
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," So your delivery company is just a cute, harmless paper route?"
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth, Phew!
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, No! It's a serious business.
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," Yes it's a tremendous responsibility, alright! [He chuckles.] What if a paper were to land in a puddle?"
The Route of All Evil,Hermes, Civilisation as we know it might get splashed!
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, Why do they always treat us like dumb kids? We're practically old enough to find the Fox Network infantile!
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, We'll show 'em. All Awesome Express needs is a sturdy interstellar delivery craft. [He shows Dwight an advert for a hovercraft.] Voilà! You got a quarter?
The Route of All Evil,Dwight," Man, the ad said to allow four to six seconds for delivery."
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, More like seven!
The Route of All Evil,Bender, I'm really starting to swell up with beer. I must look ridiculous.
The Route of All Evil,Fry," No, you have a healthy glow."
The Route of All Evil,Bender," Oh, my God! I just felt it ferment!"
The Route of All Evil,Leela, Ooh! Let me feel. [She and Fry sit next to Bender. She puts her ear to his chest.] Have you thought about what to name it?
The Route of All Evil,Bender," I was thinking ""Benderbrau"" if it's an ale, ""Botweiser"" if it's a lager."
The Route of All Evil,Fry," I hope it's a lager so I can take it to a ball game. [Bender belches again. Leela giggles.] Ooh, I felt that one!"
The Route of All Evil,Cubert," Uh, there's a crack in the hull here. That could cause explosive decompression."
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, Put a sticker on it.
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," Off on your first delivery, eh? You be careful, my little tinkler. [He pinches Dwight's cheek.] Remember we used to call you that, huh? Tinkler?"
The Route of All Evil,Sal, Gets movin'! Those newspapers won'ts deliver themselveses! Only the Sunday edition can dos that.
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," Goodness, there must be 50 papers in that bundle! That's a big number, 50."
The Route of All Evil,Cubert," Yeah, if you're an idiot!"
The Route of All Evil,Dwight," Three, two, one."
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, All systems go.
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, Blast-off!
The Route of All Evil,Hermes, [shouting] See you at din-din!
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth, [shouting] I'm blowing you a kiss.
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, Take evasive action!
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth, [shouting] It's closing in! You can't avoid it! It's a cheek-seeker. And ... gotcha!
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, [screaming] Nooo!
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," Business is down, so I filed papers to have you all reclassified as slaves."
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," Well, well. If it isn't our little munchkin moguls!"
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," What's the trouble, men? Need some penny rolls for your profits?"
The Route of All Evil,Cubert," Actually, thanks to Dwight's brilliant accounting and my unaccountable brilliance ... [He snorts.] ... our paper route now has over a million customers!"
The Route of All Evil,Dwight," We're finally making more money than you guys! Aren't you impressed now, Pops? Aren'tcha? Aren'tcha?"
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," Uh, in a small way, yes. But you still don't have your own building or conference table or ... or one of those things!"
The Route of All Evil,Zoidberg, Hello!
The Route of All Evil,Dwight," Our dads are never impressed, no matter what we do."
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, Maybe we should start a fire.
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, If we really wanna impress them we'll have to crush them with strategy ... Dwight Lightning!
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, Very well. But I get to name the next strategy.
The Route of All Evil,Announcer, [on TV] This week on The Real World  The Sun.
The Route of All Evil,Man, [on TV] I'm burning to death!
The Route of All Evil,Leela, You know how much an apartment that big would cost on the Sun?
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," People, as you know, our young sons have become great successes in the very same field as us."
The Route of All Evil,Bender, [simultaneous] Alright!
The Route of All Evil,Fry, [simultaneous] That's great!
The Route of All Evil,Leela, [simultaneous] That's good!
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," Naturally, we're humiliated."
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," That's why we need you, our loyal crew, to make Planet Express 800% more profitable."
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," We'll start by slashing salaries, and this time I mean really slashing."
The Route of All Evil,Leela," Uh, guys, I don't know how to tell you this, so I'll just let Fry blurt it out thoughtlessly."
The Route of All Evil,Fry, We don't work for you anymore!
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth, What?
The Route of All Evil,Leela, Dwight and Cubert made us a better offer. We're paperboys now.
The Route of All Evil,Cubert," Incoming! We got papers to stuff, team! Hup two, hup two!"
The Route of All Evil,Fry," Yes, sir."
The Route of All Evil,Bender, Right away!
The Route of All Evil,Leela," We're on it, Mr. Farnsworth."
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," Folks, the situation is grim but we shall prevail, thanks to you, our crack team of loyal dregs!"
The Route of All Evil,Hermes, I don't even know who this guy is!
The Route of All Evil,Scruffy," I'm Scruffy, the janitor."
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," Yes, of course you are. Now we've got to buckle down and save Planet Express."
The Route of All Evil,Scruffy, I'm on break.
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, Sorry to interrupt this whirlwind of activity but we have an announcement.
The Route of All Evil,Dwight," I direct your attention to these forms, which I'm presently engaged in handing to you."
The Route of All Evil,Hermes, Sweet guinea pig of Winnipeg! They've taken over our company!
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth, Balderdash! I never agreed to that!
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, No. But you did declare yourself dead three years ago as a tax dodge.
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," Tax dodge, nothing! You take one nap in a ditch at the park and they start declaring you this and that."
The Route of All Evil,Cubert," Either way, I technically inherit your building and your spaceship, which means Planet Express is now ... [He presses a button and an Awesome Express banner falls over the Planet Express logo on the screen.] ... Awesome Express!"
The Route of All Evil,Hermes, [angry] You rotten kids! [nice] Will you be hiring?
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, No.
The Route of All Evil,Hermes, [angry] You rotten kids!
The Route of All Evil,Fry," There. One million papers, folded and loaded!"
The Route of All Evil,Cubert," Hey, Leela, help me apply these flame decals I got in my cereal. They'll make the ship go faster."
The Route of All Evil,Leela, And what's your scientific basis for thinking that?
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, I'm 12.
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," Oh, did I ever tell you how I used to own that ship?"
The Route of All Evil,Zoidberg, There but for the grace of God.
The Route of All Evil,Bender," [singing] Hush, little brewski,"
The Route of All Evil,"Don't you leak,",
The Route of All Evil,Daddy wants to drink for at least a week.,
The Route of All Evil,"[He rumbles.] (talking) Oh, my God! I think it's time!",
The Route of All Evil,Fry," Hurry, Leela! Get some coasters and cold mugs."
The Route of All Evil,Fry," Push, Bender, push!"
The Route of All Evil,Leela, You're doing great!
The Route of All Evil,Bender, It feels like I'm trying to push a water bed outta me.
The Route of All Evil,Fry, Almost there. Just two more bottles.
The Route of All Evil,Bender, Is it OK? I can't hear anything.
The Route of All Evil,Fry," It's an ale! Five gallons, six ounces!"
The Route of All Evil,Dwight," Hey, what's goin' on? This is a delivery company not a delivery room!"
The Route of All Evil,Cubert," We just busted our bums delivering a million papers and this is how you greet us, with a bunch of frosty, cold beers?"
The Route of All Evil,Fry," Hey, wait a second. How did you deliver a million papers in one hour?"
The Route of All Evil,Cubert," Uh ... we just did, OK? 'Cause we're awesome! Yeah! Awesome."
The Route of All Evil,Dwight," Yeah, awesome!"
The Route of All Evil,Leela," Hello, Awesome Express; the rude, crude delivery dudes. How may I direct your call? What's that? You haven't gotten your paper? In how long?"
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," Uh, might a homeless old man have a touch more beef bourguignon? And another tequila slammer? [LaBarbara scoffs.] Please?"
The Route of All Evil,LaBarbara," Don't you sweet talk me, you wrinkly, old tube sack!"
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," Might I have one too, wife?"
The Route of All Evil,LaBarbara," Oh, you're both pathetic, being jealous of your own offspring. Now you should be happy they became successes, instead of following in your foot stamps."
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," Oh, it's true. But they grow up so fast. We just wanted a few more years of being better than them."
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," They're so stinking talented, they don't even need their fathers anymore."
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, Dad! We screwed up!
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," You did? Tough luck, suckers!"
The Route of All Evil,Dwight," Please, help us, Pops. We agreed to deliver way more papers than we can handle."
The Route of All Evil,Cubert," [crying] But we couldn't handle them, so we started dumping the extras in a crater on the Moon."
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, [crying] And now everyone's yelling at us about our missing papers!
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, [crying] And we don't know what to do!
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth, Why did you boys do all this?
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, [crying] We just wanted you to be proud of us.
The Route of All Evil,Hermes, Proud of you? You ruined us with sleazy business practices and a complete disregard for human decency. Of course we're proud of you!
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," Damn right we are! Now come on, let's go do a little father-son weaselling out of this."
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth, [from ship] Good thing I had this net installed for catching giraffes.
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," OK, boys, let me show you how a paper man does it."
The Route of All Evil,Little Prince, Au revoir!
The Route of All Evil,Dwight," Can I use the gun, Dad?"
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," Aw, what kind of father would I be if I said no?"
The Route of All Evil,Dwight," Only one house to go. We did it! [They cheer. The screen beeps and displays the Blob house. Inside, Bret Blob lifts weights.] Run away! That bully, Bret Blob, lives there!"
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, He's ugly mean stupid stink mucus! And last week we sort of ... broke his window.
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," Alright, alright. What do we do when we break somebody's window?"
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, [sheepish] Pay for it?
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," Oh, heavens, no! We apologise, with nice, cheap words!"
The Route of All Evil,Bret, I thought I heard the doorbell but I see it was the dorkbell!
The Route of All Evil,Dwight," Man, you're funny. Good one, Bret."
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," Now, now, no need to give us the business. We'd like a word with you daddy."
The Route of All Evil,Bret, Whatever. [shouting] Dad!
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," Don't worry, boys. I'm sure his father is a perfectly normal, reasonable man."
The Route of All Evil,Horrible Gelatinous Blob, What the hell do you want?
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," Mr. Blob, our sons have come to apologise for damaging your window. They've learned their lesson and they want to make amends."
The Route of All Evil,Cubert," Sorry, sir."
The Route of All Evil,Dwight," Yeah, sorry."
The Route of All Evil,Horrible Gelatinous Blob, You can shove your apology into the bottom of your one-way digestive system.
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth, Now see here. We assured our sons that you'd accept their apology.
The Route of All Evil,Horrible Gelatinous Blob," Aww. Tell you what, I'll accept their apology when they kiss my ass! Which I don't have!"
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth, No one gives my boy that option!
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," Bring it on, Jello-pop!"
The Route of All Evil,Cubert," Yeah, get him, Dad!"
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, Show 'em who's boss! [Horrible Gelatinous Blob grabs Farnsworth and Hermes and smacks them around. Then some more.] Get 'em ... Pops!
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, Right.
The Route of All Evil,Cubert, That was incredible! You are the bravest dads in the entire trauma centre!
The Route of All Evil,Dwight, You guys almost had him ... until he digested you.
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," Oh, you're good kids. [He coughs.] If I could feel anything right now, it would be pride. [Cubert and Dwight hug their dads, making them scream.] I was wrong! I can still feel pain!"
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth, He's come to finish the job! Someone toss me out the window!
The Route of All Evil,Horrible Gelatinous Blob," No, no, wait. I-I feel terrible about what happened. I-I've just been under a lot of stress lately down at the plant, y'know. They're-They're bringing in computers to ""improve productivity"" and, well, that's no excuse for how I acted. But the boy needs to see that real men solve their disagreements with words, not violence, so, uh, if you'll accept my apology, well, I hope we can put this embarrassing incident behind us."
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth, I suppose.
The Route of All Evil,Bender," Hey, chumps, I heard you were on the ass-end of an ass-kicking so I figured you could use a couple these little babies."
The Route of All Evil,Hermes," Oh, why not? Might as well live it up as long as I've got this catheter in me!"
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," Won't you join us, Mr. Blob?"
The Route of All Evil,Horrible Gelatinous Blob, Sounds like a plan!
The Route of All Evil,Hermes, This is what makes life worth clinging to; three fathers enjoying a day out with their sons.
The Route of All Evil,Farnsworth," It would seem we've taught our boys a lesson about life  Man or Blob, it's what's inside that counts."
The Route of All Evil,,
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," [singing] Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, uh-huh, uh-huh"
Bendin' in the Wind,"Well, Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride,",
Bendin' in the Wind,"Blah, blah, blah, something, Bender is great!",
Bendin' in the Wind,"Froggy went a-courtin' and Bender is great, uh-huh--",
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," Oh, my God! They dug up a bag of olestra chips from my time! [He opens the packet and Bender eats one. Something clangs around inside of him and he shits a brick. Then some.] There must be layers and layers of old stuff down there."
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, What's that? One of those Led Zeppelins I've heard so much about?
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," No, it's an old Volkswagen van. [He wipes the window clean and sees some hippie skeletons inside.] [shouting] Hey, Mister? Mind if I take this old van?"
Bendin' in the Wind,Sal," [shouting] Sure. You wanna dump the corpses out of theres, it's yourses."
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," Yeah, yeah, I've gotten used cars before."
Bendin' in the Wind,Leela, What's that? One of those Jefferson Starships I've heard so much about?
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," It's called a van, and in light of the fact that it's not a-rockin', I invite you to come a-knockin'!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Amy," Wow, neat."
Bendin' in the Wind,Hermes, It's a triumph of free-spirited German engineering.
Bendin' in the Wind,Amy," Hey, the speedometer only goes up to 80. This thing can't go faster than 80,000 miles an hour?"
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," No, it can't, but it's got a driver's-side floor and an 8-track player with genuine mono sound."
Bendin' in the Wind,Farnsworth, Where's the device that lets you speed or slow the passage of time?
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry, Under the seat.
Bendin' in the Wind,Leela, Why won't it start?
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry, It just needs some gas.
Bendin' in the Wind,Farnsworth," Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas. Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038."
Bendin' in the Wind,Leela," Gas was an environmental disaster, anyway. Now we use alternative fuels."
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry, Like what?
Bendin' in the Wind,Leela," Whale oil. [She points to a barrel of Mobil Dick Whale Oil.] Bender, lift it up to the can opener."
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Oh, no! I'm not going near it. Last time, that magnetic psycho nearly cut my head off."
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," Oh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up your inhibition unit and makes you sing folk songs."
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, What? Who said anything about me secretly wanting to be a folk singer? How ridiculous.
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," Bender, if you don't open that can right now, your fear will own you, and nothing that can opener could ever do would be worse than that."
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," OK, OK, I can do this. It's time to take life by the cans."
Bendin' in the Wind,Leela, Come on!
Bendin' in the Wind,Hermes, You can do it!
Bendin' in the Wind,Amy, Bender!
Bendin' in the Wind,Farnsworth," Go on, you dummy."
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," [singing] Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,"
Bendin' in the Wind,[He screams in pain.],
Bendin' in the Wind,"Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,",
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," Oh, no!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," [singing] Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,"
Bendin' in the Wind,Cause the master's gone away.,
Bendin' in the Wind,Zoidberg, [tapping his feet] It's toe-tapping-ly tragic.
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Doc, I can't move my arms and legs. What's wrong with me?"
Bendin' in the Wind,Doctor, This is the worst part of the job.
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," What is it, good news?"
Bendin' in the Wind,Doctor," Bender, your hydraulics are shot. You'll never move again."
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, You mean--
Bendin' in the Wind,Doctor," I'm sorry, you'll have to get a new one."
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," Oh, no! This is terrible."
Bendin' in the Wind,Zoidberg, Poor Bender.
Bendin' in the Wind,Farnsworth," Well, let's drag him to the kerb."
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," Wait a minute, Bender is my best friend. We can't just dump him in the gutter like Grandma's ashes."
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," [crying] Oh, my life is over. I'll never know happiness again."
Bendin' in the Wind,Robot," Ho, ho! Hello there!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Leela," Look, Bender! It's Patch Cord Adams. He heals with the power of laughter."
Bendin' in the Wind,Patch Cord Adams," Come on, take it. What's the matter, can't move your arms?"
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Obviously not, or I'd be strangling you right now."
Bendin' in the Wind,Patch Cord Adams," Hey, here's a giggle! [He plugs himself into a Jokebook Computer and downloads some jokes.] Did you hear why they're using Windows 3000 as a prison guard?"
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," No, why?"
Bendin' in the Wind,Patch Cord Adams, 'Cause it always locks up.
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," For the love of God, somebody kick his ass!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Patch Cord Adams," Well, so long. Get well soon. [He looks at Bender's medical notes.] Oh, well, so long anyway."
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Oh, I'm doomed. Everybody leave me alone. I don't wanna be seen this way."
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," Aw, you look so sad. You want me to send Patch Cord Adams back in?"
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Hey, the blues. The tragic sound of other people's suffering. That's kind of a pick-me-up. [The doctor draws back the curtain and reveals the head in a jar of Beck. Beck wears a futuristic harmonica holder around his neck with little arms that move the harmonica back and forth in front of his mouth. The doctor pulls a mask over his face and welds Beck's jar to the neck of a life-sized dummy. Beck stops playing.] Wow, that was great."
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," Hey, thanks. You a fan?"
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," I dunno. Let me see. [He focuses his eyes and sees Beck's nameplate.] Oh, my God, you're Beck! I'd get up to shake your hand and steal your wallet but my crappy body crapped out on me."
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, Don't take it so hard. I used to miss my body too but then I fished this mannequin out of the 92c Store dumpster.
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Wow. We've sure got a lot in common, Beck. I always dreamed of being a musician-poet who transcends genres even as he re-invents them, just like you."
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," So do it, robot. It's easier than it looks."
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Eh, thanks, but it's hopeless. I'll never be a musician now."
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, Or maybe you'll be the best musician ever.
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, What's this for?
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," Try and scrape it across your chest like a knife on burnt toast. [Bender struggles and strains as he tries to move the little arms on the harmonica holder.] Come on, move those arms. Use the power of mental thinking. Make it dynamic. [Bender starts moving the arms with ease and scrapes them across his scarred chest.] Yeah-ee! Alright, congratulations, my friend."
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, Why? 'Cause I can make annoying noises?
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," Exactly. I use those all the time in my music. Bender, I want you to become my new washboard player."
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, Alright! [He does a happy dance with the little arms.] Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Well, that's my good friend, Beck. I'm off to rock a series of mid-level venues."
Bendin' in the Wind,Hermes," Kudos, Bender. You got mangled and now you're a singer. Both our dreams came true."
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," Hey, I have an idea. Who wants to cram in my van and follow Bender on tour and live there, in the van?"
Bendin' in the Wind,Zoidberg," Oh, I don't know, Fry. I think I'm too poor to follow a band around in a van."
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," [shouting] Come on, move it! We gotta get to the concert and make the audience wait for it at the start."
Bendin' in the Wind,Zoidberg," Bad news, friends. My shell ran."
Bendin' in the Wind,Amy," Zoidberg, you idiot, my outfit. It's, it's--"
Bendin' in the Wind,Leela, Kinda cool.
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," Yeah, I like it."
Bendin' in the Wind,Amy," Me too, now that I'm used to it."
Bendin' in the Wind,Zoidberg," Then it was all on purpose! You're lucky to have Zoidberg as a friend. But cross me, and I'll turn on you like that!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," [singing] There's a destination a little up the road,"
Bendin' in the Wind,"From the habitations and the towns we know,",
Bendin' in the Wind,"A place we saw the lights turn low,",
Bendin' in the Wind,"The jigsaw jazz and the get-fresh glow,",
Bendin' in the Wind,"Pullin' out jives and jamboree handouts,",
Bendin' in the Wind,"Two turntables and a microphone,",
Bendin' in the Wind,"Bottles and cans just clap your hands,",
Bendin' in the Wind,Just clap your hands.,
Bendin' in the Wind,All, [singing] Where it's at!
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, [electric voice] Got a washboard stomach and a microphone.
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, That was a washboard break.
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," Oh, yeah!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Amy," Yeah! [She turns around to the bar.] One bowl of Jell-O knuckles, please."
Bendin' in the Wind,Barman, That'll be three pick-e-tures of George Washington.
Bendin' in the Wind,Amy," Oh, no! My beautiful money."
Bendin' in the Wind,Leela, It got ruined in the wash.
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," Mine too, even my change."
Bendin' in the Wind,Barman," Get lost, you money-less hippies!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Horrible Gelatinous Hick," You heard him, freaks. We don't like your type around here. These are the types we like."
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," Bender, that was the best 40-minute washboard solo I've ever heard. And the parts when I was awake blew my mind."
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Whoa, check out all those broken robots. Howdy, fellas!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Robot #1," I don't believe my broken eyes! It's Bender, the washboard player! Hey, man, we caught your concert from here."
Bendin' in the Wind,Robot #2, You rock!
Bendin' in the Wind,Fembot," Oh, oh, Bender! Sign my chest! It's in that bin behind me."
Bendin' in the Wind,Robot #3," Yo, brother, thanks for showing that broken robots are still useful."
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Aw, hang in there, folks. I'll bet before you know it, you guys'll be-- [He is interrupted by the sound of machinery in a building grinding up the robots and turning them into paperweights.] That is so wrong. They can't just melt down broken robots. Not right when they're kissing my ass."
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," Whoa, dog. Just cold chill. [A woman moves him closer to Bender.] You know, when I'm upset, I write a song about it. Like when I wrote Devil's Haircut, I was feeling really-- What's that song about?"
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Hey, yeah, I could write a song! With real words, not phoney ones like ""odelay""."
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," ""Odelay"" is a word. Just look it up in the Becktionary."
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, Ooh!
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," I'm working on my song. Hand me the Becktionary. [A man offers him the book.] No, no, the rhyming Becktionary."
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, I wish I could help raise awareness about broken robots. But what can I do? I only weigh eight pounds.
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Wait a minute, you know lots of rock stars, and most of them like to look like they care about things!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, We can all get together for a big benefit concert in San Francisco!
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," And we could call it ""Bend-Aid"", after me, Bender!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, And you can sing that song you're writing!
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, And I'll let you sing backup! But remember who the star is. Me  Bender.
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Alright. ""Hands in the air"" rhymes with ""Just don't care"" and ... finished! [He sniffs.] Eck! Smells like something died in the wall!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry, Surprise!
Bendin' in the Wind,Leela, Mind if we crash here tonight? The colours in the van are keeping us awake.
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Alright, but hands off the minibar."
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," Wow, I forgot about TV. Living free on the road, you realise how much better life is without it. Well, let's see what's on."
Bendin' in the Wind,Announcer #1," [voice-over; on TV] Tuesday, Golden Gate Park, the monsters of vaguely-folkish alterna-rock will strum your brains out at Bend-Aid! Featuring Beck, Wailing Fungus and special guest, Bender!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Announcer #2, [voice-over; on TV] A portion of the proceeds might go to help broken robots.
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry, Yeah!
Bendin' in the Wind,Zoidberg," Hooray, robot!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Amy," Bender, you're famous!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, Yeah.
Bendin' in the Wind,Leela," This coming-together of superstars really means a lot to you, doesn't it, Bender?"
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," [crying] Uh-huh. Helping my defective brothers is the first thing I've ever cared about, even the slightest bit. You know, when I first got broken, I thought my life was over. But look at me now  I've got fame, money, groupies, and it's all thanks to being completely immobilised. [He stops crying and stands up.] That's why I'll be proud to go up on stage tomorrow and say, ""Look at me, world, I am a broken robot!""."
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," Bender, you can move! You're cured!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Oh, crap! It's a miracle!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, I can move again. [crying] My music career is over.
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," Bender, I don't claim to understand ""the biz"" but wouldn't being able to move help your music career?"
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," [crying] No, don't you see? I was a hero to broken robots 'cause I was one of them. But how can I sing about being damaged if I'm not? That's like Christina Aguilera singing in Spanish. [He gasps and stops crying.] Wait, that's it! I'll fake it!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Amy, You'd better not do that at the concert.
Bendin' in the Wind,Zoidberg," I can't stop. When I eat too much dirt, I get stuff in my throat."
Bendin' in the Wind,Amy," You are so disgusting, I--"
Bendin' in the Wind,Leela, They're beautiful.
Bendin' in the Wind,Zoidberg," Ew, you're touching them!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Amy," I've never seen pearls like this. Dr. Zoidberg, you're amazing."
Bendin' in the Wind,Zoidberg, I am? At last! Recognition!
Bendin' in the Wind,Emcee," [on loudspeaker] Gentle hippies, put your filthy hands together for the folk stylings of Cylon and Garfunkel!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Garfunkel," Here's a song that was beautiful when performed by my ancestor, Art."
Bendin' in the Wind,(singing) Are you going to Scarborough Fair?,
Bendin' in the Wind,Cylon," and  [singing] Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme."
Bendin' in the Wind,Garfunkel, [singing] Remember me to one who loves there.
Bendin' in the Wind,Cylon, and  [singing] She once was a true love of mine.
Bendin' in the Wind,Leela, We're home.
Bendin' in the Wind,Amy," Well, let's earn some bread."
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," Brothers and sisters, get your love beads. Can't journey to the centre of your mind without love beads!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Hippie #1," Wow, look at the colours. These'll go great with my soul."
Bendin' in the Wind,Zoidberg," Glad you like them. I've been making fine jewellery for years, apparently."
Bendin' in the Wind,Hippie #2, I'll take three.
Bendin' in the Wind,Hippie #3," Give me one, man!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Hippie #4, I'll trade you a bad poem!
Bendin' in the Wind,Emcee," [on loudspeaker] And now, stand up and turn on your hidden tape recorders for ... Beck! With special guest, Bender, the broken robot."
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry, [shouting] Bender rules!
Bendin' in the Wind,Hippie #5," Groove on, man!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Leela," Rock it, Bender!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Zoidberg, Play that thing!
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," [singing] Can't you hear those cavalry drums,"
Bendin' in the Wind,Hijacking your equilibrium...,
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Whoa-oh, yeah!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," [singing] ...Midnight hags in the mausoleum,"
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," Thank you. That song doesn't usually last three hours, but we got into a serious thing ... and then I forgot how it ended. Anyway, one last item of business before we go."
Bendin' in the Wind,Garfunkel," Bender, to start your foundation for broken robots, here's a big, cardboard cheque for $14,000."
Bendin' in the Wind,Cylon, It's been an emotional day for me.
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, [crying] I don't know what to say.
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," Then maybe you should sing it. Lay it down, boys."
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Ladies, gentlemen, smoking heaps of machinery ... [The broken robots cheer.] ... this is a song called My Broken Friend."
Bendin' in the Wind,[The crowd cheer.],
Bendin' in the Wind,"(singing) People say my broken friend is useless,",
Bendin' in the Wind,"But I say his mind is free,",
Bendin' in the Wind,"There's lots of things my mangled robot friend could be,",
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, Kick it!
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, [singing] He could make a good...
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, and  [singing] ...hat-rack
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," [singing] He only has to stand there,"
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, [singing] Or a cheap...
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," and  [singing] ...doorstop,"
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, [singing] He doesn't need to move
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, [singing] Or a great big...
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," and  [singing] ...giant Thermos,"
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," [singing] With a twist-off top,"
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," [singing] That would be good for soup,"
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, [singing] He could be a storage closet...
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," and  [singing] ...for outdated pants,"
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, I like 'em tight!
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," [singing] My broken friend could do it all,"
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, and  [singing] Just give him a chance!
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," [singing] That robot has a tragic secret,"
Bendin' in the Wind,That I'd like to share...,
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, For real?
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," [singing] ...My broken friend is closer to me,"
Bendin' in the Wind,Than an ass to a chair...,
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, Hm.
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, [singing] ...That robot's name I never told you...
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, Who's that?
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, [singing] ...You could not foresee...
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," C'mon, give it up."
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, [singing] ...I'll say it loud and sing it proud...
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, and  [singing] His name is you and me.
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," [singing] Don't melt me down into a crowbar,"
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," [singing] It suffers alone,"
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," [singing] Just 'cause I can't move my arms and legs,"
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, Hey.
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, [singing] Or toss me into a trash can...
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," Bender, what are you doing?"
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, [singing] ...Just 'cause I can't cook you ham and eggs...
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, What are you doing?
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, [singing] ...Don't crush me into an anchor...
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, Yo! What's the dealy-o?
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, [singing] ...Just 'cause I can't jump and dance and sing...
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, Hold it! What? No!
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," [singing] ...I'm telling you, my broken friend..."
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, B-Bender.
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, [singing] ...Put your hands in the air like you just don't care!
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, No!
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," [singing] I'm telling you, my broken friend..."
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, Cut it!
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, [singing] ...Can do 'most anything!
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, Cut it!
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, Yeah!
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, Cut it!
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, Curse my natural showmanship!
Bendin' in the Wind,Robot #4," [shouting] You big, fat fraud! You're not really broken!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Robot #5, [shouting] But you will be in a minute! Bum-rush the stage!
Bendin' in the Wind,Robot #6, Get him!
Bendin' in the Wind,Hippie #6," Oh, harsh! I didn't get my beads."
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," You, minion, lift up my arm. [A stage hand points his arm forwards.] After him!"
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Well, everyone, prepare to get your guts kicked out by folk singers."
Bendin' in the Wind,Caterpillar Alien, What is this? The Year of the Jerk?
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry, Hurry! The Golden Gate Bridge! Put the metal to the pedal to the other metal.
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Oh, no! I forgot this is a hoverbridge."
Bendin' in the Wind,Leela, And I forgot this isn't a hovercar.
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry, Is any of that a problem?
Bendin' in the Wind,Zoidberg, Not if you've lived a life without regret.
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, I'll save me!
Bendin' in the Wind,Leela," Quick, grab his footcups."
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender, Hey? What? No.
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry, Phew!
Bendin' in the Wind,Leela, Bummer.
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," [shouting] Someone fat get in my way! [He lands on the thin woman and squashes her. He gets up and staggers away. Beck's bus rams him and knocks him over. Beck, Cylon and Garfunkel get out. Bender groans.] [talking] I'm broken again. I can't move any part of me."
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck, Good.
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," I'm really sorry I lied, Beck. All I ever wanted was to make music with you. I never meant to hurt anyone, or help anyone."
Bendin' in the Wind,Beck," Bender, that's some played-out, new-jack, horse crap-- But I know you don't mean it so apology accepted."
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," So, I can, uh, keep the cheque?"
Bendin' in the Wind,Garfunkel, Over my dead career!
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Well, it was worth a shot."
Bendin' in the Wind,Fry," [shouting] C'mon, Bender. If you're done scamming Beck, we're heading home."
Bendin' in the Wind,Bender," Alright, alright. Let me just do one thing to cheer myself up."
Bendin' in the Wind,[He takes a magnet from Ye Olde Tourist Trappe and puts it on his head. His pupils go wild and he starts to sing.],
Bendin' in the Wind,"Fry cracked corn,",
Bendin' in the Wind,"And I don't care,",
Bendin' in the Wind,"Leela cracked corn,",
Bendin' in the Wind,"I still don't care,",
Bendin' in the Wind,"Bender cracked corn,",
Bendin' in the Wind,And he is great!,
Bendin' in the Wind,"Take that, you stupid corn!",
Bendin' in the Wind,,
Time Keeps on Slippin',Hermes," Go get it, boy!"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry," So, Leela, how about a romantic ride in one of those swan boats? They're kinda dangerous but I finally mastered them."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," Those aren't swan boats, they're swans."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry, Oh. That explains these boat eggs.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth, Wha?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," Pitiful ballplayers of Earth, I am Ethan ""Bubblegum"" Tate, commander of the Harlem Globetrotters. [The crowd gasps.] For generations, your puny planet has lived in peace with the Globetrotter Homeworld. But now, for no reason, we challenge you to defend your honour on the basketball court. [The crowd murmurs.] Will no one meet our challenge? Have none of you pathetic Earthlings game?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry, [shouting] What happens if we lose?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," Nothing. There's nothing at stake and no threat, beyond the shame of defeat!"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," This will not stand! [He steps forward and the crowd murmurs.] I'll take you on, you air-balling bozos."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," You, old man? Sweet Clyde, laugh derisively at him."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," I may be an old man. In fact, I'm fairly sure I am. But I'll put you Globetrotters in your place with my team of mutant atomic supermen!"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Hermes," Hooray, Professor!"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth, Behold  My mutant atomic supermen.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," They're only a foot high, Professor."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," Well, they're still young. Mere atomic super boys, really. We'll need to speed up their growth with time particles called Chronitons."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender, Aren't those the particles that destroyed an entire civilisa--
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! You're off to the Tempus Nebula to gather Chronitons."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry," Hey, Leela, look at me!"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela, Your face can take a lot of punishment. That's good to know.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry, There's a lot about my face you don't know! Perhaps you and it could get better acquainted over dinner.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," Alright! Cool your jets, hotshot."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry," C'mon, Leela, why won't you go out with me? We both know there's something there."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," No, I mean cool your jets. They're melting Bender's face."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender," [shouting] Ow! Oh, my God! Ow!"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela, Here you go. Hot off the nebula.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," None too soon. While you were gone the Trotters held a news conference to announce that I was a jive sucker. [He screws a cap onto the bottle and puts it on the side of the cage. The supermen drink the particles and start to grow. One grows extremely tall, another grows an extra three arms, another grows a cannon in the middle of his chest, another turns into a spider and another gets radioactive eyes.] Behold! My invincible nuclear mutants."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Amy, Hi!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Arachneon, [sexfully] Hello!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Albert, Marv Albert here at Madison Cube Garden where the Harlem Globetrotters take on a squad of atomic supermen in what promises to be a by-the-numbers athletic contest with no surprises whatsoever. [The referee blows the whistle and the game begins.] Here's the tip-off. Globetrotter ball. Sweet Clyde Dixon to Bubblegum Tate. Drives down-court-- And Curly Joe from the rear.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Zoidberg, That one grabbed his behindus!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela, Sh!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Hermes, Quiet!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," Who dares laugh at the Jesters of Dunk? We came to terrify and humiliate you, not tickle your funnybones. Watch as I embarrass your civilisation by passing the ball to Curly Joe. [He throws the ball and Thorias jumps for it but it springs back into Tate's hand.] Only to have it remain in my hands with elastic. [He laughs and the crowd ""boos"".] And perhaps this will wipe the smiles from your faces."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Albert, Goosh goes up. [Armo grabs it.] Rejected! Grotrian from half-court. [He scores.] Yes!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Albert," Supermen lead 45-42. Arachneon with the steal, to Thorias. Thorias from downtown! [Thorias puts the ball into his cannon and blasts it into the net.] Yes! He's really showing us what a man with a cannon in his chest can do!"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," No showboarding, you atomic hotdog!"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Albert," And that's the half, with the Supermen up 48-42. Surprisingly dull, so far. [Arachneon drinks some water and signs some autographs for some kids.] Bubblegum, the Trotters are down by six. Reactions?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," It was always our plan to trail at the half, thus deepening Earth's eventual humiliation. Also, what game were the refs watching?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Albert," Curly Joe, easily amused by his own antics ... [Curly Joe slides down Grotrian's arms onto the court.] ... continues to wreak havoc on--"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," What the-- [The crowd mumbles.] Did everything just jump around, or did my brain just stroke off there for a second?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Albert," Ladies and gentlemen, something very strange has just happened in this basketball game between space clowns and atomic monsters."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth, Time-out! Time-out!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry, What's happening?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," We seem to be lurching forward randomly in time, like a needle skipping on a record player."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Amy, What's causing it? Is it my outfit?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth, No. It must have something to do with those time particles I used to grow the Supermen. Time and space are ripping apart at the seams.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Thorias, Oops!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," Oh, great! Now, on top of everything, we need a new fifth man."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry," Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Put me in, Professor. I wanna show Leela my skills."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth, Hmm. Will said skills pay the bills?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry, Who cares? We're 35 points ahead with two minutes left. What could possibly--
Time Keeps on Slippin',Albert," Globetrotters win, 244-86. A dark day for humanity, folks. We have been beaten ... in basketball."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Curly Joe," Yeah, that's how we do it!"
Time Keeps on Slippin','Sweet' Clyde, How's that?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate, You are all fools of the highest calibre.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again you screwed up. Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Hermes," I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes. We have bigger problems. This time disruption is extremely serious."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," Damn right, brother man. This chronological wang-dang-doodle could destroy the very matrix of reality."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth, Tate? What do you know about this?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," Not much, yet. But I am senior lecturer of physics at Globetrotter U. And I'd like to help you investigate."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth, You're that Bubblegum Tate?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," Well I sure ain't his grandma. Now look here, Prof. [He draws some diagrams on a board.] I think we got ourselves an excess of Chronitons in the subatomic interstices."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," Yes, I see. Something involving that many big words could easily destabilise time itself."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry, Is that a problem?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," Indeed so. At this rate, by Tuesday it will be Thursday; by Wednesday, it will be August; and by Thursday, it will be the end of existence as we know it."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Man, I'll have to ask you to clear out now. The circus need to set up for tomorrow's big--
Time Keeps on Slippin',Linda, [on TV] Time continues to skip forward randomly. Details at 11.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Linda, [on TV] This is the news at 11. The mysterious and unexplained--
Time Keeps on Slippin',Linda," [on TV] Turning to entertainment news, teen singer Wendy might just be the latest--"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Linda, [on TV] --won three Grammys last night--
Time Keeps on Slippin',Linda, [on TV] --found dead in her bathtub.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," Interesting. It's as if we behave normally during the time skips, but then we have no memory of it."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry, You mean we just--
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," My, yes. Ooh, just like that. Any luck, Bubblegum?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," Not yet. Listen, I hope you don't mind if I dribble a little while I work."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth, Not if you'll grant me the same liberty.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender," Ooh! Ooh! Bubblegum? My name's Bender and I'm a huge fan of your work, both on and off the court. Can I be a Globetrotter?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," Shut up, turkey."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," Bubblegum, look at this. The background time radiation is fluctuating wildly."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," Good Lord! That sucker's shaking around like some fine, imported booty."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Hermes," Say, I'm no physicist, but I think I know how to stop the skipping. We'll just--"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Hermes, I don't know how this was suppose to work.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Amy," Professor, I hope you find out what's wrong before we skip right past my birth--"
Time Keeps on Slippin',All," --ppy birthday, Amy."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Amy, Hooray! Look at all these presents!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Zoidberg, I hope we all have as much tomorrow at my birth--
Time Keeps on Slippin',Zoidberg, What?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry," Psst! Leela. I've set up a time-proof shelter in the closet. There's only room for two, and you're the one I wanna share it with."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," Fry, that's so sweet. Let me see."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela, How exactly will this protect us from time jumps?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry," [sexfully] Because when we're together in here, baby, time will stand still."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry, Ow!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Zoidberg, Hmm. [He hovers his claw over it.] Hmm.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," Dr. Zoidberg, can I talk to you about Fry?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Zoidberg," Leela, I would be honoured."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela, --does the worst W.C. Fields imitation I've ever seen. Zoidberg!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Zoidberg," Sorry, you must have been boring me."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," The thing is, Fry is very sweet, but he's so immature. I love his boyish charm but I hate his childishness."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Zoidberg, So he's not perfect. You don't wanna end up old and lonely like Zoidberg! [He cries then suddenly stops.] You were saying?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," Ah, there is it. The Tempus Nebula. Take a whiff through the Smellescope."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate, What's that funky jazz?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," The odour of pure time leaking. When my crew removed the Chronitons, it destabilised the nebula, causing time skips throughout the universe."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender, Ooh! Let Bubblegum tell it.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," Pretend these basketballs are time particles, my silver honky. As the nebula bounce-passes them off us ... [He throws the balls at Bender and they dent his head.] ... they cause these dents, or ""time skips""."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender, You are so smart!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate, Hold up. What if we were to move this cluster of starts to these algebraic co-ordinates?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth, Their gravity might just divert the Chronitons to the empty side of the universe.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate, Yeah. But is it possible? Moving stars would require one bad-ass gravity pump. And we'd need all the money on Earth to--
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate, What the--
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth, Wha?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Nixon," Here's the funding for your gravity pump. But it damn well better work! We can't spend all of Earth's money every day. Now, how long will it take to build?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," It won't be easy, Nixon. A jim-jam this complex might take months or even--"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," Ah, there we are. One gravity pump. [The gravity pump is huge and has a basketball on the end.] Powerful enough to move the stars themselves. Now to begin the arduous task of attaching it to the ship so th--"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," [waving] Off you go, apparently."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," [from ship] Easy, Leela. Just finger-roll that star to the cosmic basket."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela, Just a few ... more ... hundred ... thousand ... miles. There!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate, [from ship] Nothing but nebula!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," We'll have to run some tests back on Earth, but I think we've stopped the time skips."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender, Alright!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate, Jamming!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry, Hooray for Leela!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender, And what better way to celebrate our success than by me showing Bubblegum the Globetrotter uniform I made myself!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," Let me see. [Bender takes the crude uniform out of his chest cabinet and Tate rubs his hands together.] Hello, lawsuit!"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry," Leela, I want you to know I think the way you moved those stars around was really wonderful. I got you something."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," Moderately-priced, domestic, non-vintage champagne? How did you know?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry," You deserve it. I mean, nobody ever stops to tell you what a great captain you are."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela, Aw! That is so true and sweet.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry," You're smart, you're beautiful, and best of all, you'll go out with me-e?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," Fry, please try to understand  You're a man, I'm a woman. We're just too different."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender," Hey, Leela. Bubblegum might let me organise a bake sale for the Globetrotter wives. Can you teach me to make cupcakes?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," Alright, but I wanna lick the beaters."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry," I got her champagne, I opened it. What does a guy have to do?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," 86 the chump stuff, F-man. It's time to win Leela's heart with a big-showy, three-point romantic gesture."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry, Hmm. Maybe this is the moment to show her my real surprise.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," Fry, what are you doing?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate, Uh-oh. Time to boogie on down to the sauna!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry, Look. I've been studying how to pilot the ship. Impressed?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," Yeah, actually. You're doing OK. The core reactor temperature's nominal, the blinker's off."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry," I learned how to work the gravity pump too. In case we need to move more stars. So, are we dating now?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," Is that what this is all about? Please, just cut it out now."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry," Look, Leela. I know there's some perfect, amazing thing I can do to make you love me, and when I figure out what it is--"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," Fry, stop. I don't wanna hurt you, but there is absolutely, positively no way that you and I will ever, ever--"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Preacherbot, --man and wife. You may kiss the bride.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Albert, Yes!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Zoidberg, He looks radiant!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," Ye Gods, Bubblegum! We failed. The time skips haven't stopped at all."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," Even in these formal shorts, I feel like a failure."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," You tricked me into marrying you, didn't you?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry, Of course not.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela, How'd you do it? Drugs in the champagne? Hypnosis?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry," No! Drugs are for losers and hypnosis is for losers with big, weird eyebrows. I don't know what amazing thing I did you make you love me but, whatever it was, we're married now. We've got the rest of our lives to work--"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Whitey, Divorce is final.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry, What?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," Well, let's divide up the china. I guess I'll take the NFC helmets and you can have the AFC helmets."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry, Fine. Break my heart again.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Zoidberg," Don't be so hard on yourself, Fry. You lost the woman of your dreams but you still have Zoidberg. You all still have Zoidberg."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry, How did I do it? How did I get Leela to love me? I've got to figure it out.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Hermes," Maybe you're just a fantastic lover, Fry."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Amy," Um, no."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry, I don't know what I'm doing.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender," Maybe she'd come back to you if your best friend Bender were a Globetrotter. What do you say, Bubblegum?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," Hell, no."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry," Oh, it's hopeless. I did something so great that it won Leela's heart and I'll never, ever know what it was. My life is empty."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Zoidberg, [sexfully] Zoidberg!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth, No wonder we failed to stop the time skips. Diverting Chronitons is mathematically impossible. I knew I should have checked your show-boating Globetrotter algebra.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," Man, I thought you knew that algebra was all razz-ma-tazz. A Globetrotter always saves the good algebra for the final minutes."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender, Vintage Bubblegum!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth, The time skips are worse than ever now. Isolated spots are jumping by years at a time. Look.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Boy, Stupid senior citizens. Why should we have to pay for their social security benefits?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Old Man, I deserve free money!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," Well, I'm stumped. We'll have to call in the finest scientific minds in the univ--"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," Perhaps we could explode the whole damned nebula. What do you think, Curly Joe?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Curly Joe," No, man. An explosion big enough to destroy that mama would take out half the universe."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Sweet Clyde," You gotta Globetrotter that explosion up a little, Farnsy. Make it an implosion."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth," By God, Sweet Clyde is right. An implosion might just form a black hole that would stop more Chronitons from escaping."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," Whoa. Slow that brain train down, Prof. We'd need some kind of doomsday device to initiate an implosion like that."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Farnsworth, Doomsday device? Ah! Now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! [He presses a button and a machine rises out of the floor.] I suppose I could part with one and still be feared.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," Give me some skin, Prof. I'm making you an honorary Globetrotter. In fact, everybody in this room's an honorary Globetrotter."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Amy, Hooray!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Hermes, Yes!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Zoidberg, I'm a Globetrotter!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender, [gasping] Did you just say--
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," Too late, hot plate."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender," Oh, crap."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," We must leave now, for we are needed elsewhere. But we wish you Godspeed."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender," Please, please let me come with you. I can make myself taller."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate," Bender, you can talk trash, you can handle the ball. But look in your heart and ask yourself  Are you funky enough to be a Globetrotter? Are you?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender, Yes.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate, Are you?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender," I mean, with time, my funk level could--"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate, Are you?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender, [sadly] No.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Tate, Deal with it.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender, Oh! No!
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," [on radio] Careful with that doomsday device, Bender."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender," What does it matter? I'll never be a Globetrotter. My life, and, by extension, everyone else's, is meaningless."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela, [on radio] Roger.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry," Leela, about the wedding. I don't know what I did to make you love me, and I don't think I tricked you into it, but maybe I did. And if I did, I'm sorry."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," It's OK, Fry. You know we'll always be friends, right?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry, Yeah. But I don't guess anything I could do will ever make you feel the same way about me that I do about you.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela, I guess not.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender," Well, the doomsday device is ready. Maybe blasting this quadrant of space into a hell storm of flaming nothingness will cheer me up a little."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," OK. Let me just take the ship out to a safe distance. [She is about to sit down when she sees Fry still looking sad.] Actually, I think I'll go down and prep the detonator. Fry, why don't you take the helm?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry, She's so great. I feel like I can almost remember the magical thing I did to make her love me. But I guess I never will.
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender," Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like to have a dream I'll never achieve."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry," Oh! [He walks to the window and presses his face against the glass. As the ship gets further away from the nebula Fry sees the stars around it form an ""O"" in a huge message that reads ""I Love You, Leela"".] That's how I must have done it! I moved the stars themselves to write her a love note in the sky."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela," [on intercom] Detonation in three, two, one."
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry," [screaming] No! [The doomsday device implodes and the nebula, the stars and Fry's message disappear. Fry stares at the empty void. Leela and Bender walk in.] Did you see it? Did you see it?"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Bender, The explosion?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry," No, not the explosion!"
Time Keeps on Slippin',Leela, Then what?
Time Keeps on Slippin',Fry, [quietly] Nothing.
Time Keeps on Slippin',,
I Dated a Robot,Narrator," [voice-over; on TV] You're entering a realm which is unusual. Maybe it's magic or contains some kind of monster. The second one. Prepare to enter ... The Scary Door. [The scene on TV shows a man coming out of the casino.] Please send a man round back and pick up Clyde Smith, a professional gambler who's about to have an unfortunate accident."
I Dated a Robot,Smith, [on TV] A casino where I'm winning? That car musta killed me. I must be in heaven! [He plays again and wins again.] A casino where I always win? That's boring. I must really be ... in hell!
I Dated a Robot,Sebastian Cabot," [on TV] No, Mr. Smith. You're not in heaven or hell. You're on an aeroplane."
I Dated a Robot,Smith, [on TV] There's a gremlin destroying the plane! You've gotta believe me!
I Dated a Robot,Sebastian Cabot, [on TV] Why should I believe you? You're Hitler!
I Dated a Robot,Smith, [on TV] No! [He turns to the seat next to him.] Eva Braun! Help me!
I Dated a Robot,Bender, Saw it comin'!
I Dated a Robot,Fry," I just saw something incredibly cool  A big, floating ball that lit up with every colour in the rainbow, plus some new ones that were so beautiful I fell to my knees and cried."
I Dated a Robot,Amy, Was it out in front of Discount Shoe Outlet?
I Dated a Robot,Fry, Yeah.
I Dated a Robot,Amy, They have a college kid wear that to attract customers.
I Dated a Robot,Fry," Well I don't care if it was some dork in a costume. For one brief moment I felt the heartbeat of creation, and it was one with my own."
I Dated a Robot,Amy, Big deal!
I Dated a Robot,Bender, We all feel like that all the time. You don't hear us gassin' on about it.
I Dated a Robot,Fry," How can you people be so blasé? Here you are in the year 3000 or so, yet you just sit around like it's the boring time I came from."
I Dated a Robot,Farnsworth, Boring? Wasn't that the period when they cracked the human genome and boy bands roamed the Earth?
I Dated a Robot,Fry, Yeah. But now it's the distant future. Why aren't we out doing everything I ever dreamed of?
I Dated a Robot,Leela," Hey, you know what might be a hoot?"
I Dated a Robot,Farnsworth, No. Why would I know that?
I Dated a Robot,Leela, Let's take the rest of the morning off and take Fry to do everything he ever wanted to do.
I Dated a Robot,Fry, [sexfully] Everything?
I Dated a Robot,Leela, Except that.
I Dated a Robot,Sal," Sos your fantasies has always been to destroys a planet, huh?"
I Dated a Robot,Fry," Yeah, what did they ever do for me?"
I Dated a Robot,Leela, Wow! The most humdrum activities look almost exciting through your eyes. What should we do next?
I Dated a Robot,Fry, I wanna see the edge of the universe!
I Dated a Robot,Amy, Ooh! That sounds cool.
I Dated a Robot,Zoidberg," It's funny. You live in the universe, but you never do these things till someone comes to visit."
I Dated a Robot,Farnsworth, [from ship] There it is! The edge of the universe!
I Dated a Robot,Fry, Far out! So there's an infinite number of parallel universes?
I Dated a Robot,Farnsworth," No, just the two."
I Dated a Robot,Fry," Oh, well, I'm sure that's enough."
I Dated a Robot,Bender, I'm sick of parallel Bender lording his cowboy hat over me! Let's move on to Fry's next fantasy.
I Dated a Robot,Fry," [shouting] Yee-haw! Bow before your master, puny mortals! [He hoots.] Giddy-up!"
I Dated a Robot,Girl," Mommy, why is that man like that?"
I Dated a Robot,Mother, Don't look at him!
I Dated a Robot,Fry, That was fun. Let's give him a treat!
I Dated a Robot,Leela, Keep your palms flat.
I Dated a Robot,Fry, The tongue tickles.
I Dated a Robot,Fry, These new hands are great. I'm gonna break 'em in tonight.
I Dated a Robot,Farnsworth," Yes, it's been quite an hour and a half."
I Dated a Robot,Fry, I've only got two fantasies left  Be invisible in a chocolate factory and be romantically linked with a celebrity.
I Dated a Robot,Bender, I could pound your head till you think that's what happened.
I Dated a Robot,Fry, OK.
I Dated a Robot,Leela," Wait, hold on. It is actually possible to meet any celebrity you want."
I Dated a Robot,Fry, It is?
I Dated a Robot,Leela, Of course! You should read a blimp sometime.
I Dated a Robot,Fry, [reading] Download a celebrity from the Internet? What part of that do I understand?
I Dated a Robot,Leela, It's simple. You can download a celebrity's personality and appearance into a blank robot.
I Dated a Robot,Fry," Hey, I have an idea. Let's do that!"
I Dated a Robot,Farnsworth, Onto the Internet you go!
I Dated a Robot,Bender," Oh, and while you're there, pick me up a few credit card numbers."
I Dated a Robot,Trekkie #1, No way! Kirk could kick Picard's ass!
I Dated a Robot,Trekkie #2, Yeah? At least Picard had the guts to admit he was bald!
I Dated a Robot,Trekkie #1, What? You take that back!
I Dated a Robot,Fry, Ooh! eBay!
I Dated a Robot,Auctioneer, Are there no further bids for this exquisite galaxy? [He bangs his gavel.] Sold to The Being of Inconceivable Horror.
I Dated a Robot,The Being of Inconceivable Horror, Will a money order be OK?
I Dated a Robot,Auctioneer, Yes.
I Dated a Robot,Fry, So where's the celebrity dating place?
I Dated a Robot,Leela, Let's search the web. [They both look around. Leela points.] Over there.
I Dated a Robot,Salesman, Welcome to Nappster. Let's see what celebrities we've got in stock. [An image of a celebrity appears in front of him.] Can I interest you in Gwyneth Paltrow?
I Dated a Robot,Fry, Nah. I read in Newsweek that she drinks human blood.
I Dated a Robot,Salesman," Then, uh, how about Cleopatra, whose beauty destroyed mighty empires."
I Dated a Robot,Fry, I'd prefer someone from the era of shaved underarms. Do you have anything with more of a Lucy-Liu-feel to it?
I Dated a Robot,Salesman," Nah, nothing like that. Though we do have Lucy Liu. [Fry gasps.] Only woman ever to be named People magazine's sexiest woman of the year twice. In 2003, and then again in 2063."
I Dated a Robot,Fry, I'd like the 2003 model.
I Dated a Robot,Fry, I've found her! What do I do now?
I Dated a Robot,Farnsworth, Download her. Let's just put a blank robot in the drive.
I Dated a Robot,Fry, It worked!
I Dated a Robot,Liubot," You're one sexy man, [mechanical voice] Philip J. Fry."
I Dated a Robot,Fry, [muffled] It worked perfectly!
I Dated a Robot,Leela," Well, you downloaded Lucy Liu. Are you just going to stare vacantly at her and not say anything?"
I Dated a Robot,Liubot," I find your slack-jawed stare very attractive, [mechanical voice] Philip J. Fry."
I Dated a Robot,Fry, Did you hear that? She likes me!
I Dated a Robot,Farnsworth," Well, duh! She's programmed to like you!"
I Dated a Robot,Fry, But this is Lucy Liu! Perhaps the only good actress of the 21st century! She's more than just a piece of software.
I Dated a Robot,Liubot, Would you like to take a moment to register me?
I Dated a Robot,Fry," Uh, not right now."
I Dated a Robot,Liubot," I'll remind you later, you hot stud, you!"
I Dated a Robot,Fry," So, uh, what do you feel like doing?"
I Dated a Robot,Liubot, Would you like to take a moment to register me?
I Dated a Robot,Fry, I said later!
I Dated a Robot,Fry," Then when I feel so stuffed I can't eat anymore, I just use the restroom, and then I can eat more."
I Dated a Robot,Liubot," You should write a book, Fry. People need to know about the [mechanical voice] can eat more."
I Dated a Robot,Fry," Oh, Lucy! You're just like I always thought you'd be from your movies."
I Dated a Robot,Liubot," My personality is mathematically derived from my movies, proportionally weighted by box office receipts."
I Dated a Robot,Fry, You're cute!
I Dated a Robot,Liubot, You're cute!
I Dated a Robot,Fry, You!
I Dated a Robot,Liubot, You!
I Dated a Robot,Fry, You!
I Dated a Robot,Liubot, You!
I Dated a Robot,Fry, You!
I Dated a Robot,Farnsworth," Oh, dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop and he's an idiot. Well, that's love for you."
I Dated a Robot,Bender, Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!
I Dated a Robot,Leela," Bender, this is Fry's decision ... and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life."
I Dated a Robot,Leela, She doesn't really love you. She can't. She's just a machine that--
I Dated a Robot,Bender," [shaking his fist] Stay away from our women! You got metal fever, boy! Metal fever!"
I Dated a Robot,Fry," Well, so what if I love a robot? It's not hurting anybody."
I Dated a Robot,Hermes, My God! He never took middle school hygiene. He never saw the propaganda film.
I Dated a Robot,Farnsworth, It's just lucky I keep a copy in the VCR at all times.
I Dated a Robot,Narrator," [in movie] Ordinary human dating. It's enjoyable and it serves an important purpose. [He turns the table over and a crying baby appears. He turns it back again.] But when a human dates an artificial mate, there is no purpose. Only enjoyment. And that leads to ... tragedy."
I Dated a Robot,Billy, [in movie] Neat-o! A Marilyn Monroe-bot!
I Dated a Robot,Monroe-bot," [in movie] Ooh! You're a real dreamboat, [mechanical voice] Billy Everyteen."
I Dated a Robot,Narrator, [in movie] Harmless fun? Let's see what happens next.
I Dated a Robot,Billy's Mom," [in movie] Billy, do you want to walk your dog?"
I Dated a Robot,Billy," [in movie] No thanks, Mom. I'd rather make out with my Monroe-bot."
I Dated a Robot,Billy's Dad," [in movie] Billy, do want to get a paper route and earn some extra cash?"
I Dated a Robot,Billy," [in movie] No thanks, Dad. I'd rather make out with my Monroe-bot."
I Dated a Robot,Mavis," [in movie] Billy, do you want to come over tonight? We can make out together."
I Dated a Robot,Billy," [in movie] Gee, Mavis, your house is across the street. That's an awfully long way to go for making out."
I Dated a Robot,Narrator," [in movie] Did you notice what went wrong in that scene? Ordinarily, Billy would work hard to make money from his paper route. Then he'd use the money to buy dinner for Mavis, thus earning the slim chance to perform the reproductive act. But in a world where teens can date robots, why should he bother? Why should anyone bother? Let's take a look at Billy's planet a year later. [The scene changes and a foam hand rolls across an empty football field.] Where are all the football stars? [The foam hand drifts across an empty laboratory.] And where are the biochemists? [The scene changes to a split screen of human and robot couples making out on beds.] They're trapped! Trapped in a soft, vice-like grip of robot lips. All civilisation was just an effort to impress the opposite sex ... and sometimes the same sex. Now, let's skip forward 80 years into the future. Where is Billy?"
I Dated a Robot,Billy, [in movie] Farewell!
I Dated a Robot,Narrator," [in movie] The next day, Billy's planet was destroyed by aliens. [A fleet of flying saucers destroy buildings with laser shots.] Have you guessed the name of Billy's planet? It was Earth. Don't date robots!"
I Dated a Robot,Announcer, [voice-over; in movie] Brought to you by the Space Pope.
I Dated a Robot,Leela," Did that make any impression on you, Fry? Fry?"
I Dated a Robot,Liubot, Ooh!
I Dated a Robot,Farnsworth, I knew I should have shown him Electro Gonorrhoea  The Noisy Killer.
I Dated a Robot,Bender," What is the world coming to? That Fry's a sicko poivert, I tell you. Dating a robot! It's an atrosmacy!"
I Dated a Robot,Leela," But Fry's our friend, Bender."
I Dated a Robot,Bender," Aw, jeez, would you stifle there, meatbag?"
I Dated a Robot,Leela," You stifle, Bender."
I Dated a Robot,Zoidberg, Hooray! Finally you're standing up to him.
I Dated a Robot,Leela, Although he is completely right.
I Dated a Robot,Bender, We've got to stem this tidal wave of moral decay. It's time to shut down nappster.com!
I Dated a Robot,Bender, Who's in charge of this dump?
I Dated a Robot,Jeff Jervis, [standing up] That'd be me. If you're an investor you can dump your money in the hole there.
I Dated a Robot,Bender," Listen, you fat Internet nerd."
I Dated a Robot,Jeff Jervis, Listening.
I Dated a Robot,Bender, Your company promotes wrong love! If you don't shut down right now the only thing wired about you will be your jaw!
I Dated a Robot,Jeff Jervis, Y-You can't shut us down. The Internet is about the free exchange and sale of other people's ideas. We've done nothing wrong.
I Dated a Robot,Liu, [shouting; from room] Help! I'm being held prisoner!
I Dated a Robot,Zoidberg, Someone in trouble is!
I Dated a Robot,Jeff Jervis," No, stay out! There's a ... guy going for the Tetris world record in there!"
I Dated a Robot,Kidman, Who are you?
I Dated a Robot,Cheech, Don't hurt us!
I Dated a Robot,Liu, Help me! They've been holding me prisoner for 800 years.
I Dated a Robot,Zoidberg, The real Lucy Liu! The one you can see a movie of in the popcorn stadium.
I Dated a Robot,Bender, So what's your problem?
I Dated a Robot,Liu, Those sweaty nerds are making illegal copies of us. [Someone downloads a copy of her and she fizzles and screams.] [crying] It hurts!
I Dated a Robot,Jeff Jervis, [from outside] Open this door! Don't make me call the maintenance guy.
I Dated a Robot,Bender, It's a bluff!
I Dated a Robot,Leela," We can't take that chance. Move, people, move!"
I Dated a Robot,Michael, Please pick me up before you go-go.
I Dated a Robot,Leela, She asked first.
I Dated a Robot,Nerd," Um, are you Lucy Liu?"
I Dated a Robot,Albright-bot, Sure!
I Dated a Robot,Jeff Jervis," Oh, we're doomed. They got the head, they uncovered the sign! Soon the whole world will learn we're cyber-criminals. And we would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling adults."
I Dated a Robot,Man," We'll stop them. They like Lucy Liu, we'll give them all the Lucy Liu they can handle! Hand me that back-up disk."
I Dated a Robot,Zoidberg, Did you see me escaping? I was all like--
I Dated a Robot,Liu," Thanks for rescuing me. Especially you, Bender. [sexfully] Mmm. Quite a masculine piece of metal, aren't you?"
I Dated a Robot,Bender," Hey! Don't look at me like that. If you're thinking of crossing the line with Bender, you can forget it. Bender don't bend that way."
I Dated a Robot,Leela," Hey, look. It's another Lucy Liubot."
I Dated a Robot,Liubot #2, [mechanical voice] I am Lucy Liu. Give me your spines.
I Dated a Robot,Zoidberg," Hey, what the--"
I Dated a Robot,Liubot #2, [mechanical voice] Take this and that and one of these.
I Dated a Robot,Liu, Hey! Cut it out! I don't need this kind of publicity!
I Dated a Robot,Leela," Alright, Liu. Time to kick your frosty, well-toned ass! Yah!"
I Dated a Robot,Bender, Then along came Bender.
I Dated a Robot,Zoidberg, Looks like you're retaining water.
I Dated a Robot,Liu," That was incredible, Bender. You're like Jackie Chan before he got all doughy."
I Dated a Robot,Bender," Oh, shucks! I wasn't afraid of that robot. I'm pretty brave once you get past my macho exterior! [He screams. A crowd of Liubots march towards them.] It's an army of Lucy Lius!"
I Dated a Robot,Liu, They're horrible!
I Dated a Robot,Liubots, [mechanical voices] Take this and that and one of these.
I Dated a Robot,Liubot #3, [mechanical voice] Robot crouching tiger.
I Dated a Robot,Liubot #4, [mechanical voice] Robot crane style!
I Dated a Robot,Zapp, Now that's a wave of destruction that's easy on the eyes!
I Dated a Robot,Liubot #5, [mechanical voice] Hi-yah.
I Dated a Robot,Fry, This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has a vampire and an explosion!
I Dated a Robot,Liubot, It's amazing the way you [mechanical voice] notice two things.
I Dated a Robot,Alex," [in movie] No, don't open that coffin! It's ticking!"
I Dated a Robot,Natalie," [in movie] I have to, Alex. That coffin's not going to open itself."
I Dated a Robot,Vampire, [in movie] Bleurh!
I Dated a Robot,Liu, Let's hide in here. It'll add to my box office gross.
I Dated a Robot,Leela, Fry?
I Dated a Robot,Fry," Aw, you guys came to watch me make out! That is so sweet. [He notices Liu and gasps.] Wait a minute! Is that the head of who I think it's of?"
I Dated a Robot,Liu," Read the jar, Evelyn Wood! Dr. Z?"
I Dated a Robot,Leela," Fry, a herd of Lucy Liu are destroying the city. Is yours acting normally?"
I Dated a Robot,Fry, Let me see. [He kisses her.] Yep. Why do you ask?
I Dated a Robot,Alex," [in movie] Mr. Mayor, if you want to see a real vampire, look in the mirror!"
I Dated a Robot,Mayor, [in movie] I can't! I'm a vampire!
I Dated a Robot,Zoidberg, Why?
I Dated a Robot,Leela, And Nappster says illegal copies never hurt anybody.
I Dated a Robot,Fry, [shouting] Quick! This way!
I Dated a Robot,Fry," Sorry, ladies. Employees only."
I Dated a Robot,Leela," Oh, no. They're forming a human pyramid ... of robots."
I Dated a Robot,Bender, Damnit! We weren't counting on them being as smart as they are sexy!
I Dated a Robot,Liu, A dangerous mistake to make.
I Dated a Robot,Zoidberg, At least we've got food.
I Dated a Robot,Leela," Dr. Zoidberg, cut open that bag!"
I Dated a Robot,Zoidberg, Hooray!
I Dated a Robot,Leela, And don't eat it.
I Dated a Robot,Liubot #2, [mechanical voice] Ow!
I Dated a Robot,Liubot #3, [mechanical voice] System overload!
I Dated a Robot,Liubot #4, [mechanical voice] Error!
I Dated a Robot,Liubot #5, [mechanical voice] Does not compute.
I Dated a Robot,Zoidberg, Life was bad but now it's good forever!
I Dated a Robot,Bender," You'll be safe in here, sweetheart. [He opens his chest cabinet and takes out another head.] Get lost, Pavarotti!"
I Dated a Robot,Fry," Lucy Liubot, if I don't survive the corn, I want you to know that I love you as much as a man can love a computerised image of gorgeous celebrity. Which it turns out is a lot."
I Dated a Robot,Liubot," Oh, Fry, I love you more than the moon and the stars and the [mechanical voice] poetic image number 37 not found."
I Dated a Robot,Fry," What are you doing, darling? Get down!"
I Dated a Robot,Liubot #3, [mechanical voice] Light hot. Oil temperature rising.
I Dated a Robot,Liubot #4," [mechanical voice] Oh, no."
I Dated a Robot,Liubot #5, [mechanical voice] Malfunction.
I Dated a Robot,Liubot #6, [mechanical voice] This ain't good.
I Dated a Robot,Liubot #7, [mechanical voice] System error.
I Dated a Robot,Fry, You saved us. Are you alright?
I Dated a Robot,Liubot," Yes, my love. I'll be just [mechanical voice] massive corn clog in port seven."
I Dated a Robot,Liu, Are you the last copy of me?
I Dated a Robot,Liubot, Yes.
I Dated a Robot,Liu," Erase her, Fry."
I Dated a Robot,Fry, What? No!
I Dated a Robot,Liu," Fry, when you downloaded her without my permission, you stole my image, and in the end that's all I really have. That and the largest gold nugget in the world, one mile in diameter."
I Dated a Robot,Fry, But I just downloaded her because I love you.
I Dated a Robot,Liu," If you love the real Lucy Liu and not just what you've seen in movies, genre-straddling lawyer shows and kiss-ass articles in People magazine, you'll blank out that robot."
I Dated a Robot,Fry," I'm sorry. Hug me, Liubot."
I Dated a Robot,Liubot," I'll always remember you, Fry-- [mechanical voice] Memory deleted."
I Dated a Robot,Bender," I know it hurts, buddy. But at least you're not in a sick relationship with a robot anymore."
I Dated a Robot,Fry, Uh-huh. And I guess now maybe I can get to know the real Lucy Liu.
I Dated a Robot,Bender," Pft! Yeah, at our wedding!"
I Dated a Robot,Liu, It's true. Bender and I are in love.
I Dated a Robot,Fry," But, but--"
I Dated a Robot,Bender," Don't be a prude, Fry!"
I Dated a Robot,,
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," Oh, put down the binoculars, Fry. The wall of that strip club isn't going to collapse twice in one day."
A Leela of Her Own,Fry," I know, and I've grown to accept that. Now I'm more interested in that new pizza parlour across the street. Kinda makes me pine for my days as a pizza delivery boy. ""Here's you pizza,"" I'd say. ""I didn't order any,"" they'd say. And then I'd be off to my next adventure."
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, That story stunk. Hand me the binoculars. [He hands them to her and she snaps it in half and looks through it like a telescope. Across the street an alien opens up Family Bros. Pizza.] I think the owner is from Cygnus 5.
A Leela of Her Own,Farnsworth, Cygnoids? On our block? Flying foo! They should go back where they came from.
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," Professor, please! Society's never gonna make any progress until we all learn to pretend to like each other. Now let's go over there and make these hideous strangers feel welcome."
A Leela of Her Own,Farnsworth, No!
A Leela of Her Own,Blek, You sure about these chairs? Guidebook says human legs bend down at knee.
A Leela of Her Own,Blek," It's OK, Mama. Anyone complains, I bend legs up for free. [He sees Fry, Bender and Leela through the window.] Ooh! Customers! [Enter the trio.] Welcome to Earth pizza store. Here, sit. I bend knees for you."
A Leela of Her Own,Bender, Ooh! That's a-comfy!
A Leela of Her Own,Blek," OK, now, what kind of pizza goes in you? [He points to a topping menu that offers silt, asbestos, flaming magnesium, stucco, scarab and guano.] Silt? Asbestos? We got guano -- very fresh!"
A Leela of Her Own,Fry, Uh ... hmm ... do you have any food?
A Leela of Her Own,Blek," Here, try a deep dish pizza. [He puts a pizza topped with slop on the table.] Contains four kind of things."
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," I don't mean to offend, but this tastes like vomit."
A Leela of Her Own,Cygnoid Woman, [happy] Thank you.
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," No, actually, I did mean to offend a little. This is awful."
A Leela of Her Own,Fry," Hey, hey. What's wrong? Was it something Leela said?"
A Leela of Her Own,Cygnoid Woman," [crying] We come to Earth to start new life. Raise fat spoiled Earth kids, hang many underwear from Earth clothesline, live Earthican dream."
A Leela of Her Own,Fry," Aw. Don't cry, foreign people. I used to work in a pizzeria and as soon as I stop hallucinating and blasting puke, I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza, Earth style!"
A Leela of Her Own,Cygnoid Woman," Oh, thank you, magic biped!"
A Leela of Her Own,Blek," You save us, a-sir. If we cannot make Earth pizza our dream will die. Just like rats we crushed to make the wine."
A Leela of Her Own,Fry," For starters, only use quality ingredients. Case in point  No more live bees. [He holds up a jar of live bees.] Oregano works equally well. And when you put pizzas in the oven, don't get in with them."
A Leela of Her Own,Cygnoid #2," Hey, ocupado!"
A Leela of Her Own,Fry," Most important of all is the big screen TV. Human families need a TV when they're eating so they don't have to talk to each other. [He turns the TV on and there is a blernsball game on.] Ah, the Earthican pastime  Blernsball!"
A Leela of Her Own,Uecker," [on TV] Mulligan drives the ball. It's going, going and caught by the shortstop. Mets lose again. Man, I haven't seen play this bad since the days of Bob Uecker! This is Bob Uecker saying thanks for watching!"
A Leela of Her Own,Blek," Mets? Shortstop? Pinching the hitter? I don't understand this ""blernsball""."
A Leela of Her Own,Fry," Well, if you're going to be Earthicans, we'll have to teach you. How about your pizzeria plays a game against Planet Express? Oh, but you'll need nine players."
A Leela of Her Own,Cygnoid Woman, No problem!
A Leela of Her Own,Cygnoid #2, Play the ball!
A Leela of Her Own,Farnsworth," [shouting] Go, team! Beat those no good Cygnoids! Show them they stink at a game they've never played before!"
A Leela of Her Own,Blek," Ah, this is why I love Earth! Beautiful star-brightened day, friendly blernsball game with chum pals! So pleasant for everybody."
A Leela of Her Own,Scruffy, Hit by a pitch. Take your base.
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, [shouting] Sorry about that. I guess I needed a few more warm-up pitches.
A Leela of Her Own,Bender, No batter! No batter! [Leela pitches and knocks the second Cygnoid over.] No batter anymore.
A Leela of Her Own,Scruffy, Take your base.
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, [shouting] I didn't mean to hit you. I have some trouble with depth perception.
A Leela of Her Own,Cygnoid #2," Yeah, me too now."
A Leela of Her Own,Bender," Hey, batter, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter! [The ball hits the Cygnoid.] Duck!"
A Leela of Her Own,Scruffy, Take your base.
A Leela of Her Own,Cygnoid #3," Please, lady, I want to live. Can I use bat to protect head?"
A Leela of Her Own,Bender, Apparently not.
A Leela of Her Own,Man, Check out the one-eyed bean machine!
A Leela of Her Own,Blek, Hooray! I make a score point!
A Leela of Her Own,Fry," Leela, you beaned a run-in. You'd better let me pitch."
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, But I've got a no-hitter going. [She sighs.] You're right. Here.
A Leela of Her Own,Randy," Don't take her out, she's a firecracker!"
A Leela of Her Own,Doubledeal," Excuse me, I'd like to talk to you."
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, Am I under arrest?
A Leela of Her Own,Bender, Wait! I know you. You're the sleazebag who owns the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.
A Leela of Her Own,Doubledeal, Not anymore. Now I'm the sleazebag who owns the New New York Mets.
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, The Mets? Those bums are worse than me.
A Leela of Her Own,Doubledeal, Close to it. But they don't draw a crowd like you. Which is why I wanna sign you to the team.
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, You mean I'd be the first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball?
A Leela of Her Own,Commissioner," Well, yeah, but basically you'd just be a publicity stunt. I figure a one-eyed lady skull-buster might bring out the freakshow crowd."
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, Wow! The first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball.
A Leela of Her Own,Commissioner," Again, yeah, but basically you'd just be--"
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, Ta-da! The first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball. How do I look?
A Leela of Her Own,Hermes, Like a sexy Yogi Berra!
A Leela of Her Own,Farnsworth, Why is your number seven-eighth's?
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, All the whole numbers have been retired.
A Leela of Her Own,Fry," Wow! I must say, I'm impressed. You look just like a ball player. Can I pat you on the butt?"
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," Fry, I'm a professional athlete! So go ahead."
A Leela of Her Own,Fry, Oh! Now I'm too nervous.
A Leela of Her Own,Uecker," Well, folks, it's only the fifth inning but the Swedes have already turned this one into a ""laffer"". And that's with two F's. The crowd is pouring out of the stadium L.A.-style."
A Leela of Her Own,Doubledeal," Skipper, we're losing the crowd. Put it our new novelty act  Leela."
A Leela of Her Own,Skipper, Darn it! I already put in the circus clown.
A Leela of Her Own,Doubledeal," Yeah, but he bunted. Clowns are only funny when they swing away."
A Leela of Her Own,Announcer," [on loudspeaker] Your attention, please. Now pitching for the Mets  Turanga Leela. [Leela walks out onto the pitch but the crowd doesn't notice.] A one-eyed woman."
A Leela of Her Own,Woman, Come on! Throw like a girl!
A Leela of Her Own,Fry," [shouting] Go, Leela!"
A Leela of Her Own,Bender," [shouting] Come on, girl!"
A Leela of Her Own,Amy, [shouting] Too much eyeliner!
A Leela of Her Own,Uecker," This is history in the making, folks. Bjornson steps up to the plate and Leela delivers."
A Leela of Her Own,Bender, Bullseye!
A Leela of Her Own,Uecker, Ooh! An inauspicious start for the career of the first woman blernsballer. [Another batter steps up and Leela beans him. The crowd gasps again.] An inauspicious continuation for the career of the first woman blernsballer.
A Leela of Her Own,Crowd, [chanting] Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean!
A Leela of Her Own,Uecker," Ouch! It's a three-bean-ball salad. The Mets fans love it though, and who can blame them? They haven't had much to cheer about this year--"
A Leela of Her Own,Doubledeal," Kid, that was great! You got us more publicity than a cowboy in a shark tank. Poor Tex, he was quite a shark."
A Leela of Her Own,Man #1, Hey!
A Leela of Her Own,Man #2, Hey!
A Leela of Her Own,Man #3, Come on!
A Leela of Her Own,Man #4, I win!
A Leela of Her Own,Bender, Oop! Sorry.
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," Bender, how did you get in here?"
A Leela of Her Own,Bender," [taking off his shades] As your agent, I have access to you at all times."
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, Since when are you my agent?
A Leela of Her Own,Bender," Quiet, call coming in. [He clicks his headset.] Yes? A big endorsement deal for Leela? How much? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass! Deal!"
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," Bender, that's great! How much did you get me?"
A Leela of Her Own,Bender, [impressed] One hundred dollars.
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," [reading] As a pitcher, I serve up plenty of bean balls. So I know good beans when I see them. Bean-Bay Beans  They're the beaniest!"
A Leela of Her Own,Director #1, Cut!
A Leela of Her Own,Uecker," In very short order, Leela has become a fan favourite."
A Leela of Her Own,Bender," You're the best, babe! [His phone rings.] Hang on. Call comin' in. [He picks up.] What's that? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass! Deal!"
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, So what did you get me?
A Leela of Her Own,Bender, [impressed] A thousand and one pesos!
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," Yo soy muy malo en lanzar, pero yo soy muy bueno en comer frijoles. Come los Bean Bay frijoles, los frijoles de los reyes."
A Leela of Her Own,Director #2," Cut! OK, now do one with bean suit on!"
A Leela of Her Own,Blek, Leela really bringing in the customers.
A Leela of Her Own,Cygnoid Woman," This keep up, we need to buy second sauce toilet."
A Leela of Her Own,Girl," When I grow up I want to injure men by throwing stuff at them just like you, Leela. Will you sign my magazine?"
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," Aw! Sure thing, sweetie. Who should I make it out to?"
A Leela of Her Own,Girl," Well, uh ... to eBay?"
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," That's a popular name today. Little ""e"" big ""B""?"
A Leela of Her Own,Bender," Five bucks an autograph, 200 fans. Add a one and two zeros in front of that and we got ourselves a wad!"
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, I'm not doing this for the wad. I'm doing it for all the struggling female athletes who need a role model.
A Leela of Her Own,Woman, Yeah! A role model for how to stink!
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, What? Who are you?
A Leela of Her Own,Woman, Jackie Anderson. I'm on the blernsball team at NNYU and I was hoping to get to play in the majors soon.
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," Oh, following in my footsteps?"
A Leela of Her Own,Jackie, Pft. God forbid! Your little freakshow is making it impossible for real female ball players to be taken seriously. I hope you're proud of yourself.
A Leela of Her Own,Bender," Alright, show's over. No refunds. You heard the robot. Get out!"
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," I'm a fool. The fans haven't been cheering for me, they've been cheering at me."
A Leela of Her Own,Amy," Don't be upset, Leela. You, um ... you look really cute in your uniform."
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, [crying] That's what makes it so sad. I thought I was doing something heroic.
A Leela of Her Own,Bender, You are. What about that little girl you visited in the hospital? You know the one I mean? The one who died?
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," You're right. I can't let people down anymore. As God as my witness, I vow to earn the respect of girls and women everywhere. I will become the best blernsball player of all time."
A Leela of Her Own,Hermes," That's statistically impossible. In 77 innings you haven't gotten a single out. At this rate, you're sure to go down as the worst blernsball player of all time."
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, Oh. Then I have a new vow. I solemnly swear that I will become not the worst blernsball player of all time.
A Leela of Her Own,Fry," Hey, look! The players who broke the various colour barriers."
A Leela of Her Own,Bender, When will Man learn that all races are equally inferior to robots?
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," Ah, here we are. The worst player in history. If I can be just a little better than him I can slink away with my head held high."
A Leela of Her Own,Bender, It says he once struck out when his tongue got stuck to an unusually cold bat.
A Leela of Her Own,Fry, And here he is trying to make a catch with an oven mitt.
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, It's even a crummy hologram.
A Leela of Her Own,Aaron Jr.," I'm not a hologram, though I am crummy. [He holds out his hand.] Hank Aaron XXIV."
A Leela of Her Own,Fry, Hank Aaron XXIV? How could you play so blowfully? The original Hank Aaron was great!
A Leela of Her Own,Aaron Sr.," No, I was better than great. I was the home run king!"
A Leela of Her Own,Bender, Neat!
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," So, Hank-- The bad Hank. Just how blowful were you?"
A Leela of Her Own,Aaron Jr.," Well, I had a low batting average."
A Leela of Her Own,Aaron Sr.," Low? It was zero, you fungo! You went your whole career without getting a hit."
A Leela of Her Own,Fry, Leela could beat that. She's pitched her whole career without getting an out.
A Leela of Her Own,Aaron Sr.," You stink, lady! Hey, Junior, she belongs in the exhibit instead of you."
A Leela of Her Own,Aaron Jr.," Forget it. This job's too cushy to give up. [He picks up Wade Boggs' head in a jar and drinks from it.] Ah, Wade Boggs! Goes down smooth!"
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," Look, I don't wanna be in this exhibit. That's why I need your help. So I can be one tiny iota less pathetic than you."
A Leela of Her Own,Aaron Jr.," Oh, I can't help you play better than Tiny Iota. That guy was great. But I'll teach you everything I know."
A Leela of Her Own,Aaron Jr.," OK, let's see what you can do."
A Leela of Her Own,Bender, One thing she can do is lodge a ball in the depth centre of your brain. You better get a batting helmet.
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, [quietly] Alright. Low and away.
A Leela of Her Own,Aaron Jr.," OK, try it again. But this time keep your eye off the ball."
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," You mean ""keep your eye on the ball""?"
A Leela of Her Own,Aaron Jr.," Hey, lady, which one of us is in the hall of fame?"
A Leela of Her Own,Fry, [whispering] Pst. You're holding the bat upside down.
A Leela of Her Own,Aaron Jr., Just pitch the ball.
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, OK. Eye off the ball.
A Leela of Her Own,Bender, Strike!
A Leela of Her Own,Fry, Hooray!
A Leela of Her Own,Aaron Jr.," You did it, Leela!"
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, I didn't hit the batter! For once I was pitching and not just belly-itching!
A Leela of Her Own,Aaron Jr.," Oh, you got that too? I think there's a rash goin' around."
A Leela of Her Own,Uecker," Welcome to Fenway Park, home of the Boston Poindexters, where the Mets close out a season that'll rank among Mankind's most awful crimes."
A Leela of Her Own,Fry, Hey! You opened a franchise!
A Leela of Her Own,Cygnoid Woman," Yes. Our biggest seller is Leela's Bean Pizza. Six kinds of beans, plus several things that look like beans."
A Leela of Her Own,Gilman," Beans, huh? Mmm. This is great! How to you make the crust so fizzy?"
A Leela of Her Own,Blek, Ah-ah-ah! Ancient Cygnoid secret!
A Leela of Her Own,Cygnoid Woman," My husband, some hotshot! Here's his ancient Cygnoid secret! [She holds up a jar.] Live hornets! We smush them right into dough!"
A Leela of Her Own,Gilman, I don't care if there's horse manure in it!
A Leela of Her Own,Blek, That's a-good!
A Leela of Her Own,Gilman," I wanna buy this franchise. How does $100,000 sound?"
A Leela of Her Own,Blek," Forget it! We come to Earth to make pizza, not money."
A Leela of Her Own,Cygnoid Woman," No, Blek! Other way around!"
A Leela of Her Own,Blek," Oh, right. Offer accepted!"
A Leela of Her Own,Uecker," Well, fans, Boston's turning the last game into a real ""squeeeker""! And that's with three ""e's""! Two men on and they're down to their last out."
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," Come on, skipper. It's my last chance to prove I'm not the worst player ever. Please put me in."
A Leela of Her Own,Skipper," No. We're actually winning this game. You only go in as a joke when we're eight runs behind. Or when our other pitchers sneak out early to beat the traffic. [Leela turns away and sits down.] [shouting] Come on! Let's see some fundamentals out there! [The clown honks his horn.] And not clown fundamentals. [A Boston player hits the ball and it bounces over to the clown. Instead of throwing it to another player he throws a pie instead. The skipper kicks the ground.] Aw, darn, darn darn! Now the bases are loaded! Isn't there a man on this team who can get one more out?"
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, I can.
A Leela of Her Own,Skipper, I repeat  Isn't there a man on this team on this--
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, I've been training with Hank Aaron.
A Leela of Her Own,Skipper, You've been training with the Hank Aaron?
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, I've been training with a Hank Aaron.
A Leela of Her Own,Skipper, Alright then. Get in there and pitch like you've never pitched like you before!
A Leela of Her Own,Announcer, [on loudspeaker] Now pitching for the Mets  Turanga Leela.
A Leela of Her Own,Crowd," [chanting] Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! [The bean counters open a banner.] Go, Leela!"
A Leela of Her Own,Farnsworth," [shouting] Go, Leela!"
A Leela of Her Own,Amy," [shouting] Come on, Leela!"
A Leela of Her Own,Bender, [shouting] Put it right down the pike!
A Leela of Her Own,Fry," [shouting] Strike him out, Leela! Do it for the hundreds of women everywhere!"
A Leela of Her Own,Announcer, [on loudspeaker] Your attention  Now pinch-hitting for the Poindexters  Jackie Anderson.
A Leela of Her Own,Uecker," Would you look at that! College blernsball's finest female hitter making her big league debut against pro-ball's worst female anything. I've never seen anything this bizarre, and I've seen Mr. Belvedere naked! Woo!"
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, [quietly] Keep cool. She's just like any other player. She puts on her sports bra one arm at a time.
A Leela of Her Own,Umpire, Strike one!
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," Strike one, a personal best!"
A Leela of Her Own,Umpire, Strike two!
A Leela of Her Own,Uecker," [on loudspeaker] Remember, fans, this exciting moment is brought to you by Month Old Franks, the hotdogs with experience! Mmm-mmm! [Leela and Jackie wipe their brows. Hermes wipes his brow with a sponge, and squeezes it into a file marked ""Ballpark Sweat"". Leela throws the ball, Jackie swings and hits it. The elastic tightens and breaks. The crowd look up and gasp. While they aren't looking, Bender chuckles and steals some drinks from the people in front of him. Amy takes one too. The un-tethered ball flies through the air and into a target marked ""Hit It Here And Win The Game"". The target lights up, a bell rings, Jackie runs around the pitch, the giant rats run out and the Slurm blimp crashes.] A grand slam blern. The Mets lose! Their season is over! And no question, Leela, the first woman ever to reach the Majors, will go down as the single worst player in the history of blernsball! [Leela walks sadly to the bench. Jackie jumps around with joy and the Boston players lift her up.] And yet tonight we have witnessed the beginning of a great career for the first woman to play the sport well -- Jackie Anderson!"
A Leela of Her Own,Jackie, Leela?
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, Jackie. I guess you were right. I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry.
A Leela of Her Own,Jackie," No, don't be. It turns out you were an inspiration after all."
A Leela of Her Own,Leela, [crying] I was?
A Leela of Her Own,Jackie," Uh-huh. You were so awful that women everywhere set out to prove they don't stink as bad as you. You know, like a pig or something."
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," Oh, that's so kind of you. I guess I made a difference after all."
A Leela of Her Own,Jackie," You absolutely did, Leela. Now please, please retire. Immediately."
A Leela of Her Own,Leela," Hey, kid. Catch!"
A Leela of Her Own,Aaron Sr.," Well, at least you're still the worst football player of all time."
A Leela of Her Own,Aaron Jr., Yeah. Yeah.
A Leela of Her Own,,
A Pharaoh to Remember,Linda," [on TV] Up next, daring daylight robbery at a municipal swimming pool."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Ooh! This is it! Turn me up!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Linda," [on TV] Earlier today, a foul-mouthed bandit robbed the municipal pool, making off with the contents of over three lockers."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, More like three lockers and a sink!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela, Bender? Did you have something to do with this?
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Of course not.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Hermes, Holy spitz! He's sportin' skintight Speedos!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Amy, They don't leave much to the imagination.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Hermes," Actually, on a robot, they sorta do."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Morbo, [on TV] One puny human got a look at the robber...
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Here we go. Here we go!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Morbo," [on TV] Describing him as a short, nasty, muscular..."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," Yeah, make me famous, big head!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Morbo, [on TV] Caucasian human male.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, What?
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry, Hey! Now what am I supposed to watch and drink all day?
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, This is an outrage. What's the point of pulling the biggest pool caper ever if nobody knows you did it?
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry," Well, there's the material rewards."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," You mean this junk? [He opens his chest cabinet and water floods out along with a beach ball, a float, a bikini top and a small child.]"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Boy, Whee!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, [crying] All I ever wanted was for people to remember my name. [hoarse] It's Bender.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Farnsworth," Oh, fuff! Why bother remembering anything? You're just going to forget it five seconds later."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," [crying] It's so unfair. A debonair robot with a zesty in-your-face outlook doomed to obscurity like the rest of you, especially Leela. If I died tomorrow, no one would even notice."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Scruffy," Boy, I've never seen him so down, or ever before."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," How does a nobody like me get famous? [He sees a mailbox and gasps.] I know! [He puts his foot in it.] Hey, look! I'm stuck! But I haven't given up hope! Call a soft-news journalist!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Woman, You're not stuck.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, [sadly] Shut up.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," Hey, everyone do The Bender! This move's called The Bender!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Roller-Skater," Yo, hotwheels. This circle's about free expression, not fascist moves!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, A blank wall! Fame is mine!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, There. Now no one will forget how I lived or my attitude regarding butt.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Sal," Alrights, ladies, let's flush these artists lofts straights to hell!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, [screaming] No!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, I'm the first one to work. A new low.
A Pharaoh to Remember,All, Surprise!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry," Happy funeral, Bender!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, A surprise funeral? For me?
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry, We just wanted to show you that you really will be remembered.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Zoidberg, [opening the coffin] Now if the deceased would kindly take his place of honour.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Ooh! Cushion-y! And a minibar!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry," Dearly beloved, we are here today to remember Bender, taken from us in the prime of life when he was crushed by a runaway semi driven by the Incredible Hulk."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Aw! You knew my favourite cause of death.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry, Now let us each remember the best things about Bender in our own way. Professor?
A Pharaoh to Remember,Farnsworth, Your standard bending unit is made of an iron-osmium alloy. But Bender was different. Bender had a point-04% nickel impurity.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, [crying] It's what made me me.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Hermes," If you ever needed a small package brought into the country without a lot of X-raying and such, Bender always had a free body cavity."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," Eh, the Professor's was better."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela," Bender, shush. You're supposed to be dead."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Say more about how great I am. And where's the crying? You people look like you're waiting for the bus.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Zoidberg," [singing] Oh, Danny-boy,"
A Pharaoh to Remember,"The pipes, the pipes are calling--",
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Who-y-boy?
A Pharaoh to Remember,Zoidberg, [singing] From glen to glen and down--
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," Danny-boy? You're at my funeral, singing about some dead stiff named Danny-boy? You really are a massive bonehead."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Zoidberg, I'm expressing my sorrow.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," Get lost! I'd say ""Don't quit your day job"" but you're awful at that too."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela, We're trying our best.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," Your best is an idiot. Let's pick it up, people. So far it's been crap after crap! I croaked, now show me some love!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Amy, Bender was a truly special--
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, [shouting] Louder and sadder.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Amy, [shouting] Bender was a truly special--
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, [shouting] Next!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Preacherbot, Dear Lord--
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," [shouting] Oh, next!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Zoidberg," [singing] Oh, Danny-boy--"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Come on! Surely there must be someone here who knows how great I was.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry," Yes there is, Bender. Bender was a lot of things to a lot of people. But, looking back, the number one thing I can say about him is this, and simply this  Bender was my friend."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," What? That's it? Who are you? You're nobody! This is the worst funeral ever! [He pushes his legs through the bottom of the coffin and stands up.] I hope you're all happy. You've succeeded in convincing me life is worth living, by showing how bad my funeral will suck."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Amy, I know whose funeral we'll be attending next!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Farnsworth," [bashful] Oh, stop!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Farnsworth," News, everyone! Today you're going to Osiris 4 to deliver this enormous sandstone block."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry, I thought something looked different in here.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry, Hi. We have a giant stone to deliver. Sign here.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Osiran," Ah, very nice. Much like the 10 million identical stones used in the future tomb of our great Pharaoh Hermenthotip."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela, Impressive. Who's building it?
A Pharaoh to Remember,Osiran, You.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela, Say again?
A Pharaoh to Remember,Osiran, You are now slaves of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip. Guards.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry, Call it a hunch but I've got a bad feeling about this.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry, You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work but they don't pay you or let you go.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela, That's the only thing about being a slave!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Osiran," Attention. You are now possessions of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip, heir to the Tenth Dynasty, bringer of the good aspects of the annual floods."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry, Incredible. This place is just like the Ancient Egypt of my day.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Osiran, That is no coincidence. For our people visited your Egypt thousands of years ago.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry," I knew it! Insane theories, one; regular theories, a billion."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Osiran," We learned many things from the mighty Egyptians, such as pyramid-building, space travel and how to prepare our dead so as to scare Abbott and Costello."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry, Also Wolfman!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Look at these swanky tombs! These people really know how to die.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela, Are you crazy? They worked thousands of people to death to make these stupid monuments.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," Hey, you spend your whole life building a guy's toe and you're gonna remember him. [He looks across at a slave being whipped as he carves a stone toe.] I think I'm gonna like it here!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Man #1," Yeah, I, uh, noticed your sign and I thought I'd come over here and look into getting involved in your program."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Man #2, What we do is make you starve to death.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Osiran," One, two, three, pull! [He whips them and they pull.] One, two, three, pull!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Australian Man, Oh! Bloody chunder!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," Pick it up, people. We're enslaved here to do a job. Master? Do we have to count to three every time? Couldn't we just count to one. Or better yet one-half?"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Osiran," Good idea, slave. [He whips Bender and counts quicker.] One-half, pull! [He whips them.] One-half, pull!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Now we're slavin'!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," Come on, guys. Pharaoh's countin' on us. Work faster, like this. [He pushes a block up the side of the tomb and the Osiran runs after him, whipping as he goes. He stops to catch his breath.] You call that motivating me? Don't just whip with your arms. The power comes from your hips. Like this."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela," Bender, quit giving the slave drivers pointers!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry, Yeah. Remember who your real friends are.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, I'll tell you who I remember. [He points at some tombs.] Anopsis ... Pleotut ... Whatshisname. He was the greatest of all.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Osiran, Pharaoh Hermenthotip approaches.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Hurry! Hurry! Pharaoh's coming! Get that nose in place. Come on!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Hermenthotip, Excellent work! I am very proud of all you slaves.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Viva Hermenthotip!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Hermenthotip," And now, I have a grand announcement. In honour of your achievement, you're all hereby--"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, [screaming] No!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Hermenthotip, [hoarse] Tell the slaves they can all go--
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Go faster? I told them but they're so damn lazy.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Hermenthotip, [hoarse] No. I mean they are all free--
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Free-loading off you? I agree.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Hermenthotip," [hoarse] No, I--"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Osiran, Pharaoh Hermenthotip is dead.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, [crying] He's whippin' angels now.
A Pharaoh to Remember,High Priest, We commend the body of Hermenthotip to the abode of the damned. The damned good looking! [He grins but no one laughs.] Pharaoh commanded me to tell that joke at his funeral.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," [crying] I'll always remember you, Hermenthotip!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,High Priest," To equip Pharaoh for his journey, we bury him with his favourite possessions. Such as his heart and liver. [The slaves lower some canopic jars into the hole.] And the many goods he left in his royal garage. [A pickup truck back up to the hole and tips Hermenthotip's stuff into it.] Also, this bag of cats our culture considers holy."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Singer," [singing] Pharaoh my God-king,"
A Pharaoh to Remember,"You are cold and deceased,",
A Pharaoh to Remember,I used to have him sing...,
A Pharaoh to Remember,Singer, P-P-P-Pharaoh and his pets...
A Pharaoh to Remember,Singer," But the years went by,"
A Pharaoh to Remember,"And Pharaoh died,",
A Pharaoh to Remember,Suzie will have joined him in the afterlife--,
A Pharaoh to Remember,Osiran, Hermenthotip is gone. The time to designate a new Pharaoh is at hand.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Wow!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Osiran," At dawn tomorrow, the high priest will consult the Wall of Prophecy to determine Hermenthotip's successor. [He points across the river at the illuminated wall. Bender hoots.] That concludes the funeral. You don't have to go home but you can't stay here."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry, Can you believe it? Pharaoh's dead!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Slave #1," Yes! Tonight we are slaves to no one, except the rhythm!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela, Yeah! Play those bongos!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry, I'm gonna spin till I fall down!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, We interrupt this ancient prophecy to bring you late-breaking bulletin. He hammers the back of his head and creates and imprint of himself on the wall.
A Pharaoh to Remember,High Priest," Great Wall of Prophecy, reveal to us God's will that we may blindly obey."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Priests, [chanting] Free us from thought and responsibility.
A Pharaoh to Remember,High Priest, We shall read things off you.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Priests, [chanting] Then do them.
A Pharaoh to Remember,High Priest, Your words guide us.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Priests, [chanting] We're dumb.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry, You know what else stinks about being a slave? The hours.
A Pharaoh to Remember,High Priest," The prophecy is strange and crudely drawn at best. It indicates that, we are ""here"" and our next Pharaoh is over there, near some ... tents."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," [shouting; from reeds] Those are waves, jackass. It's supposed to be a river!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry, Hey. I think I know who the next Pharaoh is!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela," Oh, Lord!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,High Priest," We hear your voice, oh, great Pharaoh. Reveal yourself to us."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Behold! I have emerged from the place of spells and fairies!
A Pharaoh to Remember,High Priest, It is he. Just as the Wall of Prophecy prophesied. [He points at Bender's imprinted face on the wall.] Long live Pharaoh Bender!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Slaves, [chanting] Long live Pharaoh Bender!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela, This society is a bunch of idiots.
A Pharaoh to Remember,High Priest," People of Osiris 4, please welcome a man who started as a slave but worked his way up to Lord of All Creation! Our new Pharaoh, Bender!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Citizens of Me! The cruelty of the old Pharaoh is a thing of the past. [The crowd cheers.] Let a whole new wave of cruelty wash over this lazy land.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela, What did he say?
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Hear the word of Pharaoh. Build unto me a statue of ridiculous proportion. One billion cubits in height ... [The priests gasp.] ... that I might be remember-ed for all eternity. And be quick about it!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," Lowly slave, why are you not working?"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Slave #2, I am.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, I meant yourself to death.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Slave #3," Mighty Pharaoh, it hurts when I breathe."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," Well then what do you think you should stop doing? [He taps Fry and Leela with his foot.] Crawl, pigs!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela, Ow!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, The Pharaoh has spoken.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Your task is nearly completed. Don't let down Pharaoh now.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Osiran," The great monument is finished, oh Pharaoh. And now, the unveiling."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Statue, Remember me. [A jet of fire comes from its eyes.] Remember me. [Another jet.] Remember me.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Osiran," Does it please you, my lord?"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," Hmm ... it's a good start. Uh, yeah, it's definitely big alright. I just wonder if it's too big, y'know? I mean, are people gonna be remembering me or the statue?"
A Pharaoh to Remember,High Priest," But, sire, we made it to your exact specifications."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Too exact if you ask me. Tear it down and try again. But this time don't embarrass yourselves.
A Pharaoh to Remember,High Priest," Ladies and gentlemen, the Pharaoh suddenly died."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela, Good riddance.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, [shouting; from tomb] What about my servants?
A Pharaoh to Remember,Priest," Oh, yeah."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry," Bender, I really hope that's you. 'Cause if it isn't ... we're in trouble!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela, You jerk. Why'd you have to drag us along?
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, I wanted to watch you remember me.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela, Did you really think you'd need all this junk in the afterlife?
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Afterlife? Pft. If I thought I had to go through a whole other life I'd kill myself right now.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela, Well rot in peace. Fry and I are leaving.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," Sorry, but we're totally sealed in. [He knocks the wall.] Nothing can get in or out. Except millions of snakes. [Snakes pour in from the eyes on a picture of Bender à la the snakes in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Fry screams.] Here, have a pomegranate schnapps from my private distillery and start sharing fond memories of me, Bender."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry, What proof is this? Some huge number?
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela, It's explosive! Maybe we could escape by setting fire to the distillery and blowing this whole place to rubble! [She jumps onto a wooden statue of Bender.] Let's get a little kindling going!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, No! You can't blow up my monument. I won't be remembered.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela," Oh, right, how selfish of me. We'll just stay here forever. Hey, Fry? Remember that robot ""Bender""?"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry," Bend-er? Doesn't ring a bell. [Bender gasps.] Did you hear something, Leela?"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela, No. But I bet it wasn't someone who was good at stealing.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," Stop it, stop it! It's not right! You've crossed a line."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry," Hey, Leela, you know who I remember?"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," Oh, please, let it be me."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry, That guy who used to bend things. You know?
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," Me, please!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry, Hermes.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, blow up my statue."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela," Oh, Bender! When did you come in? Hold still!"
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela, Let's blow this tomb!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Slave #1, Pharaoh Bender! He once more walks among the living.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, [running past] How we doing?
A Pharaoh to Remember,Statue, Remember me.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, [crying] I will. I will.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender," Please, just leave me alone."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela," Bender, I understand your desire to be remembered. But you don't need a statue for that."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, [crying] I don't?
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela," No. You have your legacy as a brutal, tyrannical dictator, and that will outlive any monument."
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, You really think they'll remember me?
A Pharaoh to Remember,Fry, Absolutely.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, Well in that case. One planet down! Helmsman...
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, [from ship] Set course for Earth!
A Pharaoh to Remember,Leela, [from ship] That's not Earth.
A Pharaoh to Remember,Bender, [from ship] Oh.
A Pharaoh to Remember,,
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, What do you think of the view Fry?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry," It really puts things in perspective. I mean, from up here an entire world can seem utterly insignificant."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," Hey nice seats! We're close enough so when you knock a player down with a beer bottle, he stays down!"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, I don't get it. Is blernsball exactly the same as baseball?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Farnsworth, Baseball?? God forbid!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Face it Fry. Baseball was as boring as mum and apple pie. That's why they jazzed it up.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry," Boring? Baseball wasn't - hmm, so they finally jazzed it up?"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Home run!! Woooo! Right?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Umpire, Out!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, What just happened? Why is the ball on that springy thing?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, It's traditional. Just like aluminium bats and the seventh inning grope.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, I got me a souvenir! [A kid looks sadly up at Bender] Aww here you go kid!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Zoidberg, I'd like a jumbo squidlog please.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Man, We don't sell those.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Zoidberg," Alright, alright. Let me have one of your young on a roll."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Man, We're out of rolls.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Zoidberg, Fine! Just give me something crawling with parasites.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry," Mmmm, at least hot dogs haven't changed."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, Hey buddies who wants popcorn?
Fear of a Bot Planet,All," I'll have some, me, yeah!"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, Anyone want butter on that?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry," Hey I'm starting to get the hang of this game! The blerns are loaded, the count's three blerns and two anti-blerns and the infield blern rule is in effect, right?"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela," Except for the word ""blern"" that was complete gibberish. [The blernsball falls into a hole and indescribable mayhem ensues! Fry scratches his head in confusion. Leela writes on her score card. All right! Yes!!"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, What just happened?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Miller's on a pace to hit 70 blerns!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Farnsworth, He's good all right. But he's no Clem Johnson. And Johnson played back in the days when steroid injections were mandatory.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't have lasted one pitch in the old Robot Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there was a blern hitting machine!"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Exactly! He was a machine designed to hit blerns! I mean come on! Wireless Joe was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, Oh and I suppose pitching at 5000 was just a modified howitzer.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Yep.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, You humans are so scared of a little robot competition you won't even let us on the field.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, What are you talking about? There's all kinds of robots down there.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," Yeah doing crap work! They're bat boys, ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But how many robot managers are there?"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Eleven?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, Zero! [He throws his bottle on the floor and it breaks. A small robot comes out and cleans it up.] And what a surprise! Look who's scraping up the filth! Is it a human child? I wish!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Farnsworth, Oh dear Lord!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, What's wrong?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Farnsworth, It's...my...new...pager.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Hermes, [on pager]   This is Hermes. A package just came in. Everyone is to return to the office immediately. [The crew grumble. A pigeon lands next to Hermes' image.] Get away you filthy bird! Shoo! Professor turn me off quick!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Farnsworth, I'm sorry what?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Hermes, [on pager]   Argh! [The bird takes off with the hologram. Hermes screams.] See you at the office!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, Admit it. You all think robots are machines built by humans to make their lives easier.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry," Well, aren't they?"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, I've never made anyone's life easier and you know it!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Farnsworth, Great news everyone. You'll be delivering a package to Chapek 9. A world where humans are killed on sight!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Why is that great news?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Farnsworth, I'm glad you asked that question Fry. You see Chapek 9 was colonised centuries ago by a murderous crew of radical robot separatists.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, Oh so just 'cause a robot wants to kill humans that makes him a radical?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Hey hold on. I understand these robots hate humans but how do they feel about humanoid aliens?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Farnsworth, They're not fans.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Hermes, That's why Bender will have to make the actual delivery.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," Oh I get it, make the robot do all the work!"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, This is the first actual work you've ever had to do around here.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Really? Which one?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Oh come on Bender. Last month it was Robomadan and before that Robonzaa.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Man that one was a blast!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, It wasn't just a blast it was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Hermes, Now look here Bender. I respect your diversity to the extent the law requires but you used up all your days off when you had that bout of Roberculosis.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," All right, I'll go. But so help me, I'll hold a grudge against every last one of you for the rest of your lives."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Farnsworth, Well then it's settled. So long everyone!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, So let me get this straight  This planet is completely uninhabited?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, No. It's inhabited by robots!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela," OK Bender, we're here. It's time to get to work."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," Yes Miss Leela, tote that space barge, lift that space bale."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela," Now we can't land on the surface because those robots will kill Fry and me, so we'll have to stay up here and lower you with the winch. And remember  You don't know humans, you don't work for humans, and above all, you don't like humans!"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, I'll try to keep that in mind!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela," Hmm, he seems pretty angry."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Yeah but I guess I'd be angry too if I had to go to some uninhabited planet.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Maybe we ought to do something nice for him.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, There. That ought to show that stupid robot we care about him.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry," Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," [on screen]   I'm in trouble. they found out I work with humans and - oh no, oh no!"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Oh my God! We have to go down and rescue him.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, No we can't! They'll kill us on sight.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Well what are we going to do?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela," I don't know, I don't know. It's not an easy decision. If only I had two or three minutes to think about it."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela," OK. If we're going to save Bender, we've got to look and act exactly like robots."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, [robot voice]   I am fully operational Captain.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela," We have to walk like robots, talk like robots and if necessary solve complex differential equations like robots."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, I can sort of dance like a robot. Will that help?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Fry first of all this is serious. And second of all...
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry," Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten store bought costumes."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela," Yeah, but there wasn't a Woolworth's in this quadrant."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot guard #1, Halt!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot guard #2, Be you robot or human?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Robot...we be.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Uh yup! Just two robots out roboting it up! [He sort of dances like a robot.] Eh?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot guard #1, Administer the test.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot guard #2, Which of the following would you most prefer? A  A puppy? B  A pretty flower from your sweetie or C  A large properly formatted data file?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot guard #1, Choose!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Is the puppy mechanical in any way?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot guard #2, No. It is the bad kind of puppy.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Then we'll go with that data file.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot guard #2, Correct.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot guard #1, The flower would also have been acceptable.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot guard #2, You may pass.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela," Now if you see any robots, just stay out of their way. [An alarm sounds. Hundreds of robots come out of doors from all sides towards Fry and Leela. Another alarm. The robots clear the area.] So far, so good."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot builder," Little to the right, there you go."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Have you seen this robot?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot builder," Sorry, can't help you. [To the crane.] Hey, watch it! Don't drop that there! [The crane drops a brick into the wall and it disappears.] Aw!"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela," Come on Fry, walk like a robot."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, I can't. I have to go to the bathroom.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Robot's don't have bathrooms.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Oh right. I wonder where they all smoke in high school.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Listen. Just go behind those garbage cans. I'll stand guard.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Hurry up Fry.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Resin-offering robot, Sir? Are you aware that you're leaking coolant at an alarming rate?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Uh...
Fear of a Bot Planet,Resin-offering robot, Well let me just patch you up with some hot resin.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry," I think the leak's stopping itself. [It doesn't.] Wait. [Still going.] Wait. Yeah, there we go. [Starts again.] Wait. Yeah!"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Resin-offering robot, What sort of robot turns down a free blast of searing hot resin?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, I'm sorry. My friend and I have to go and perform some mindless repetitive tasks.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Resin-offering robot, Sounds like a romantic evening. I won't keep you.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Patrol Officer #1, Get the humanoids.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Patrol Officer #2, Get the intruder.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Announcer, [on loudspeaker]   Intruder alert! Intruder alert!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Quick! Let's duck in here!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Announcer, [on radio in movie]   We interrupt this sound file to bring you a terrifying announcement. A non-metallic being has been sighted in the vicinity of Make Out Point.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Rusty, [in movie]   Say Wendy. Your chassis is a little scuffed. Mind if I polish it for you?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Wendy, [in movie]   Did you hear that Rusty? It sounded like a human.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Rusty, [in movie]   Relax Wendy. Humans will never come to our defenceless little town. It's perfectly safe to let our guard down - even for a second.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot Human, [in movie] Graaah! [It tears Rusty's head off and eats it. Wendy screams.] I will eat and digest you all with my system of mighty organs! Behold!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Audience, Ooooo!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Wow the 3-D's great!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Mine's not working!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot General," [in movie]   Funny, isn't it? The human was impervious to our most powerful magnetic fields, yet in the end he succumbed to a harmless sharpened stick!"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Wendy, [in movie]   I'm just glad the nightmare is over.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot General," [in movie]   It'll never be over Wendy. Even now humans are lurking in our playgrounds, our breezeways, perhaps even...our movie theatres!"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, God help us!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, OK. Keep an eyeout for Bender.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot #1, So what did you think of the movie?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry," Umm, too much romance, not enough human killing."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot #2," Yeah, it was a real chick flick."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, What's that?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot #1," What do you mean ""What's that?""? Its 5 o'clock  Time for the daily human hunt."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Try to stay with the crowd so no one notices how crummy you look.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Crummy Robot, Awww that was uncalled for!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, I'm over here!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot #4, I heard a human was draining coolant behind garbage can 738.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot #5, I heard they unscrew our lugnuts at night and eat them at their human brunches.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot Mayor," Welcome to a very special human hunt. We have with us today a guest who's irrational hatred of humans makes me look like a human sympathiser! [The crowd laughs.] A newly arrived refugee from Earth, lets hear it for - Bender!"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, It's him. He's OK!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, Death to humans!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Ahh! It's good to hear his voice!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," Many said I was too extreme when I first called for the annihalation of the human species, as well as some of the more cunning monkeys. But after living on Earth I can tell you that I am, if anything, too merciful!"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, My God! He's become evil. [Leela stares at him.] I mean eviler!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," Thank you, thank you. And if you enjoyed that diatribe then you'll want to purchase my spoken word album, just 18.95! Act now and you'll get this Bender action figurine."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender Figurine, Bite my shiny metal ass!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot Mayor, Let the hunt begin!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," Now. Your basic human is between three and twenty five feet tall and is made of a hairy, oily goo wrapped in a t-shirt."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot #1," Is it true they bite your neck, suck your transmission fluid and then you become a human?"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," Sure, why not?"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot #1, Anything in the trap?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, Nothing. Today's active humans prefer a low calorie bait.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot Mayor," Well that makes 146,000 unsuccessful hunts in a row. But I've got a good feeling about tomorrow."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," Wait, what's that?"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot Mayor, Oh thats the old abandoned adult book store. Nothing in there except a few mouldy old shreads of robot pornography.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," Hmmm, sounds like a breeding ground for humans. I'd better check it out."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, Oh yeah! You're a bad girl aren't you?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Psst! Bender!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, Huh? Wha? You! What the hell are you doing here?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, We've been looking for you. Last we heard you were under arrest as a human sympathiser.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, I was. But they let me go when I told them that I'd killed a million billion humans.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Good for you. Now lets all get back to the ship.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, What for?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, We're rescuing you.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, I don't wanna be rescued.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Say what?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," I love this planet. I've got wealth, fame and access to sleaze that those things bring."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry," But Bender, we're your friends."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," Friends? That activates my hilairity unit! I'm just a machine to you. You're no more friends with me than you are with the toaster, the phonograph or the electric chair."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, That's not true.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, Well that's how it feels to me.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Bye Bender. I'll miss you.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," Go on, get out of here before you get caught."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot Mayor," Bender, good news. Your album just went gold! What the?"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot #1, Its the humans!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot Mayor, Bender! Do something!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, Uh...got you...you muderous...flesh piles!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot Mayor," Your Honour, I intend to demonstrate beyond 0.5% of a doubt that these humans before us are guilty of the crime of being humans. Come to think of it, I rest my case!"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Judge," Thank you, Prosecutor. I will now consider the evidence."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry," Hey, wait a minute! Isn't anyone gonna defend us?"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela," Yeah! I mean, he might not have a case, but I'm genuinely not human."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot Mayor," Quiet, human!"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot clerk, Uh oh! He froze up again!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot Mayor, Try control alt delete.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot #1, Jiggle the cord.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot #2, Turn him off and on.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot #3, Clean the gunk out of the mouse.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Call technical support.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot clerk," OK, OK. He's back online."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Judge, I find the defendants - guilty!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, No!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Look! One eye! Count them  One! Not human!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Judge," The humans are hereby sentenced to live as robots live on Earth. They will perform tedious calculations and spot-weld automobiles, until they become obsolete and are given away to an inner-city middle school."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot Mayor, Great work Bender! You've taught us to hate humans all over again!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, [uneasy]   Heh heh heh! Oooh!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Are you alright?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Oh yeah.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Who are you?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Blue Elder, We are the robot elders.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, You don't look very old.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Blue Elder, Thanks. We try to take care of ourselves.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, What's going on here?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Orange Elder, Silence! Bring in Bender.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," Alright lets make this quick, I'm due at the opening of a mini-mall. Hey what is this?"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Blue Elder, Silence! It is time to put the humans to death!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, But the judge already sentenced us at the trial!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Orange Elder," Silence! That was just a show for the public. We are the true rulers of this planet, hand carved from meteorites by the Robot Founders, over four centuries ago."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Blue Elder, Silence! Come forward Bender. You will have the honour of executing the prisoners.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Green Elder, Silence! I concur!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Orange Elder, Here. Use the ceremonial killamajig.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," Uh, I'm a little tired right now. Would it be alright if I just gave them a savage beating?"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Blue Elder, No! The Elders have spoken. Show us the killing skills than have made you a media darling.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Green Elder, Do it now! Kill them before they bring down our whole society!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Elders, Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," Aww! [He throws the killamajig away. The Elders gasp.] I can't kill them. Plenty of humans have mistreated robots but not these two. they're my friends. Humans are no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid cowards."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Damn right!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," The fact is, humans are completely harmless."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Blue Elder, We're well aware of that.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, You are?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Blue Elder, Of course. But they're useful to us as a scapegoat to distract the public from their real problem.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Green Elder, Like our crippling lugnut shortage.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Orange Elder, And a corrupt government of incompetent Robot Elders.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Lime Elder," Duh, that's for sure."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Blue Elder, Quiet Jimmy.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, Well I'm glad we got all that out in the open. We'll just let ourselves out.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Green Elder, Silence! You all know too much.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Blue Elder," Elders  Execute function, control, shift, kill!"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, Stop! Take one more step and I'll breathe fire on you!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, He'll do it. He's crazy!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Orange Elder, Can they really breathe fire or did we make that up?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Blue Elder," Gee, I can't remember anymore! It might just be from that stupid movie."
Fear of a Bot Planet,Green Elder, Was that the original or the re-make?
Fear of a Bot Planet,Blue Elder, I don't - hey! They're getting away.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry," So long suckers! [The robots stand on each others shoulders] Uh, hello suckers!"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, Hey hold on a second I forgot to deliver the package.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot #1, Lugnuts! Precious lugnuts!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Robot #2, Hooray for the humans!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," Wow, I can't believe you guys did all this for me! This is the best Robanukah ever!"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, We wanted to show you that we really do respect your robot heritage.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender," Aww, thanks! You do know I made Robanukah up to get out of work right?"
Fear of a Bot Planet,Leela, Of course.
Fear of a Bot Planet,Fry, But that doesn't make it any less meaningful!
Fear of a Bot Planet,Bender, In that case - let the dancing begin! [Fry and Leela do their robot dances.] Hey you guys are good. How the hell do you do that??
Fear of a Bot Planet,,
Anthology of Interest II,Raiders of the Lost Arcade, David X. Cohen
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," There. I've finished fine-tuning my What-If machine. It can answer any ""What-If"" question, accurate to within one-tenth of a plausibility unit."
Anthology of Interest II,Leela, That's so plausible I can't believe it!
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth, Who wants the machine to show them an alternate reality?
Anthology of Interest II,Bender," Ooh! Ooh! I wanna know what would happen if I were human. I mean, being a robot's great, but we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad."
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," Oh, Lordy Lou, there he goes again. Well, let's give baby what he wants. [He holds a microphone on the machine.] What if Bender were human?"
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! I've invented a way to turn Bender into a human using a process I call ""reverse fossilisation""."
Anthology of Interest II,Leela, How does it work?
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," Well, in regular fossilisation, flesh and bone turn to minerals. Realising that, it was a simple matter to reverse the process. I've already tested it by turning the toaster into a racoon."
Anthology of Interest II,Fry, Kinda game-y.
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," Are you ready, Bender?"
Anthology of Interest II,Bender, I dunno. I'm beginning to have some second thoughts--
Anthology of Interest II,Hermes," Cover your shame, mon!"
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," It worked! Eat it, everyone whose never won a Nobel Prize! And that includes you, Amy!"
Anthology of Interest II,Bender," So this is a human body, huh? Neat! [He feels the top of his head.] Hey, my antenna's gone. [He looks at his crotch.] No, it just moved. I'm not getting good reception on it though. Maybe if I wiggle it around a little."
Anthology of Interest II,Fry," [whispering] Bender, no! You'll make God cry."
Anthology of Interest II,Bender," Well, let's see what kinda things this body can do. [He spits and Hermes leans out the way of it.] Hey, that's pretty fun. [He vomits and laughs.] Being human is great!"
Anthology of Interest II,Zoidberg, Hooray! It's just like Mardis Gras!
Anthology of Interest II,Bender, Guy! Guys! You've gotta see this. You're not gonna believe it!
Anthology of Interest II,Leela," Bender, it's OK to be proud but don't be a show-off."
Anthology of Interest II,Bender, Whoa! You look a lot better than you used to for some reason.
Anthology of Interest II,Amy," [sexfully] You're not so bad yourself, big boy."
Anthology of Interest II,Bender," Hey, that felt great! [He kisses Farnsworth.] Nah, it's not working anymore."
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth, Speak for yourself!
Anthology of Interest II,Bender, Whoa! This is awesome!
Anthology of Interest II,Leela," Bender, you drank and smoked when you were a robot."
Anthology of Interest II,Bender, But now it's bad for me!
Anthology of Interest II,Fry," Speaking of which, try these nachos."
Anthology of Interest II,Bender, Mmm! Why didn't anyone tell me tasting things tasted so good? [Miami Sound Machine's Conga plays and Bender's hips wiggle.] What's going on? That rhythm! It's doing something to my human butt.
Anthology of Interest II,Amy," Bender, part of being human is having self control."
Anthology of Interest II,Bender," Oh, my God! I bet I can eat nachos and go to the bathroom at the same time!"
Anthology of Interest II,Amy," No, Bender!"
Anthology of Interest II,Hermes, No!
Anthology of Interest II,Leela, Stop him.
Anthology of Interest II,Bender, Let me go.
Anthology of Interest II,Leela, No!
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," Come, Bender. It's time to go home and rest. I need you in top shape next week when I present you to the Nobel Prize Committee. Bender?"
Anthology of Interest II,Bender," [shouting] Goodbye, moderation!"
Anthology of Interest II,Zoidberg," Is Bender still missing for a week? Where is he, already?"
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," Uh, as I've said before, I used reverse fossilisation, which is the reverse of regular, um..."
Anthology of Interest II,Fry, [whispering] Pst! We found him!
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," Ah! Then without further stalling for time, I present to the Nobel judges the first robot ever turned into a human."
Anthology of Interest II,Wernstrom, My God! He needs medical attention!
Anthology of Interest II,Zoidberg," Pulse, 300; liver, failing; cholesterol, 40?"
Anthology of Interest II,Leela," Well, that's not so bad."
Anthology of Interest II,Zoidberg," No, I mean 40 pounds!"
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," This, um, scientific breakthrough ... heralds a new dawn in human-robot relations, yes."
Anthology of Interest II,Bender," C'mere and give old Bender a kiss. [The woman cringes.] Hey, you like grilled cheese?"
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," And, um, that's why I believe I deserve the Nobel Prize."
Anthology of Interest II,Wernstrom, Not only do you not deserve a Nobel Prize for loosing this bloated man-ball on the world but you are hereby kicked out of the Academy of Science.
Anthology of Interest II,Bender," Wait! As men of science are not your minds open to new ideas? I say, do not judge me until you have tried my way of life for yourselves."
Anthology of Interest II,Wernstrom," Young man, you have opened our minds and swayed our hearts. Let us therefore--"
Anthology of Interest II,Bender, [shouting] Party!
Anthology of Interest II,Wernstrom," Bender, you were right! Truly you have lived more in your one week of being human than the rest of us have in our entire lives."
Anthology of Interest II,Bender, Woo!
Anthology of Interest II,Wernstrom," And so, to recognise your achievements, I hereby award you the Nobel Prize ... [He takes a medal off a sleeping scientist.] ... in, uh ... [He reads the medal.] ... Chemistry."
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," Care to say a few words, Bender?"
Anthology of Interest II,Fry, He's dead.
Anthology of Interest II,Wernstrom, When did he die?
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth, About 12 hours ago when the party started.
Anthology of Interest II,Wernstrom," But he just said, ""Woo."""
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," No, that was air escaping from the folds of his fat. [He pushes the fat and Bender ""Woo's"" again.] Goodnight, sweet prince. You were the greatest man any of us will ever know. Well, let's get him out of here. He's starting to smell up the joint."
Anthology of Interest II,Narrator," [voice-over] You watched it, you can't un-watch it. Stay tuned for more Tales of Interest!"
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth, Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Katrina? Xanthor?
Anthology of Interest II,Fry," Ooh, I have one. I'm good at video games and bad at everything else. That's why I wish life were more like a video game."
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth, Can you put that in the form of a question?
Anthology of Interest II,Fry," Uh, what if that thing I said?"
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," Oh, great machine, we beseech thee. What if life were more like a video game?"
Anthology of Interest II,Nixon," [on TV] Good evening, ignorant pigs. Put down your crack pipes and your beer bongs and pay attention as I sign an historic peace accord with Ambassador Kong of planet Nintendu 64."
Anthology of Interest II,Fry, Wait a second! I know that monkey. His name is Donkey.
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth, Monkeys aren't donkeys! Quit messing with my head!
Anthology of Interest II,Nixon," I'll just put the old ""John Q. Nixon"" on it. [An arm comes out of his jar and he signs the paper ""Richard M. Nixon's Head"".] There! No major crap-ups. You're on, Mr. Ambassador. [Donkey Kong turns towards Nixon.] What the--"
Anthology of Interest II,Mario, Mamma Mia! The cruel meatball of war has rolled onto our laps and ruined our white pants of peace!
Anthology of Interest II,Man," Mr. Fry, rumour has it you know the secrets of the video game Chance. Please step into the war room."
Anthology of Interest II,Man, You'll be meeting with General Colin Pac-Man.
Anthology of Interest II,Pac-Man," Wakka, wakka, wakka, wakka. Let's get down to business. What can you tell us about the Nintendians?"
Anthology of Interest II,Fry," Well, sir, I spent all of ninth grade studying them, except for that day when my eyeballs started to bleed. And in my opinion--"
Anthology of Interest II,Pac-Man, Quickly! To the escape tunnels!
Anthology of Interest II,Pac-Man," This way, damnit!"
Anthology of Interest II,Zoidberg," Mmm, delicious! Just like stale marshmallows! [The cherry appears in front of him.] Ooh, and a cherry!"
Anthology of Interest II,Fry," Hey, watch out!"
Anthology of Interest II,Zoidberg, Uh-oh!
Anthology of Interest II,Leela," Oh, my God! He ate Fry! Fry is dead!"
Anthology of Interest II,Fry, It's OK. I had another guy!
Anthology of Interest II,Pac-Man," [gasping] Wakka ... wakka, wa--"
Anthology of Interest II,Leela, [pointing] Invaders! Possibly from space!
Anthology of Interest II,Lrrr," People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Nintendu 64. Tremble in fear at our three different kinds of ships."
Anthology of Interest II,Fry," Alright! It's Saturday night, I have no date, a two-litre bottle of Shasta and my all-Rush mix tape. Let's rock!"
Anthology of Interest II,Nd-Nd," We're losing ships, Lrrr. What are your orders?"
Anthology of Interest II,Lrrr," Increase speed, drop down and reverse direction!"
Anthology of Interest II,Fry," I've still got a trick or two up my sleeve. Watch, as I fire upwards through our own shields."
Anthology of Interest II,Bender, He's a madman! A madman!
Anthology of Interest II,Pac-Man, It's working! Victory is assured. My retirement tomorrow will be all the sweeter. [Some Nintendian missiles come through the roof and take a chunk out of Pac-Man. He screams.] I'm hit! So cold!
Anthology of Interest II,Ms. Pac-Man, [crying] No!
Anthology of Interest II,Fry," Amy, tend to the widow Pac-Man."
Anthology of Interest II,Ms. Pac-Man," [crying] Wakka, wakka, wakka."
Anthology of Interest II,Lrrr, Drop down and increase speed.
Anthology of Interest II,Zoidberg, [from inside] One ship is left only.
Anthology of Interest II,Leela," Come on, Fry! Get it!"
Anthology of Interest II,Fry," [sweating] It's moving too fast! Oh, I could never get the last one. My brother always got it for me."
Anthology of Interest II,Lrrr," Drop down, reverse direction, prepare for landing."
Anthology of Interest II,Lrrr," You are defeated. Instead of shooting where I was, you should have shot at where I was going to be."
Anthology of Interest II,Beserk, All your base are belong to us.
Anthology of Interest II,Q-Bert, [speaking backwards] Where can a guy get a pair of pants around here?
Anthology of Interest II,Fry, What do you monsters want?
Anthology of Interest II,Donkey Kong, One thing and one thing only  Quarters! A million allowances worth of quarters! No slugs or tokens.
Anthology of Interest II,Beserk, Fork 'em over! Fork 'em over!
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," Forget it, you pixilated pirates. We need those quarters to do our laundry."
Anthology of Interest II,Amy, Yeah!
Anthology of Interest II,Bender, Right on!
Anthology of Interest II,Leela," Sure thing, Professor!"
Anthology of Interest II,Lrrr, But-But space invaders need to do laundry too. I mean look at Donkey Kong here. Have you smelled his loincloth lately?
Anthology of Interest II,Zoidberg, Yes.
Anthology of Interest II,Amy, Go away! We're not giving you our quarters no matter what.
Anthology of Interest II,Lrrr, Well ... then what if we throw our laundry in with yours? Would that be acceptable?
Anthology of Interest II,Fry, I guess so.
Anthology of Interest II,Lrrr," OK, then. That settles that. But if this cape shrinks, consider your species extinct!"
Anthology of Interest II,Narrator, [voice-over] Bravo! That'll be hard to top. I pity the next Tale of Interest.
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," Well, there's time for one last question. Let's turn to the ""Who Ask"" machine to see who's next."
Anthology of Interest II,Who Ask Machine," Um, uh, um ... Amy. [Amy gasps.] I mean Leela."
Anthology of Interest II,Leela," OK. [She clears her throat.] As an alien who was abandoned on Earth, I've never really belonged anywhere."
Anthology of Interest II,Bender, Boo-hoo.
Anthology of Interest II,Fry, Ow!
Anthology of Interest II,Bender, Uh ... where?
Anthology of Interest II,Leela, So my question is this  What if I found my true home? [Farnsworth pulls a lever like on a one-armed bandit and hits Leela on the head.] Ow!
Anthology of Interest II,Leela, Where are we?
Anthology of Interest II,Leela," Nibbler, I don't think we're in New New York anymore. [She looks around the coloured landscape. A peacock open it's tail like the NBC logo.] Jeez! Apparently the phrase ""tone it down"" doesn't exist on this planet. [She sees Scruffy has been squashed under the steps.] Oh, no! We hit someone! Quick, back into the ship. [She hesitates.] Ooh! Nice boots!"
Anthology of Interest II,Cubert," Look, everyone! She killed the Man-Witch of the West!"
Anthology of Interest II,Leela, A witch? That explains how these boots magically appeared on my feet.
Anthology of Interest II,Small Glurmo #1," No, you stole them. We saw you."
Anthology of Interest II,Leela," Well ... i-it's hard to find shoes that fit me. So, anyway, who are you people? Haven't I seen you in some copyrighted movie?"
Anthology of Interest II,Small Glurmo #1," [singing] We resemble but are legally distinct from the lollipop guild, the lollipop--"
Anthology of Interest II,Amy," Greetings, Leela. I'm the Cute Witch of the North!"
Anthology of Interest II,Leela, Yeah... Can anyone fix my ship so I can get home?
Anthology of Interest II,Amy, Abraca-duh! Just ask the Professor. He lives in the Emerald Laboratory down Martin Luther King Boulevard.
Anthology of Interest II,Leela, You mean that yellow brick road?
Anthology of Interest II,Amy, The city council renamed it in 1975. [sarcastic] Ooh! Those are great shoes!
Anthology of Interest II,Leela," Oh, thank you."
Anthology of Interest II,Amy, Do they come in women's sizes?
Anthology of Interest II,Fry," OK, crow, prepare to be scared. [He gets out Stephen King's Christine.] [reading] And then, ""honk, honk,"" the car honked its own horn!"
Anthology of Interest II,Leela, Wow! A talking scarecrow. Wanna come with us to see the Professor? He might be able to give you a brain.
Anthology of Interest II,Fry, Hey! That's not a nice thing to say.
Anthology of Interest II,Bender, Beer! Beer!
Anthology of Interest II,Leela, Whiskey OK?
Anthology of Interest II,Bender, Now did you say you were off to see the Professor? 'Cause I could use a heart -- a human heart. I need to pump a lot of blood out of my basement.
Anthology of Interest II,Zoidberg," And I'm the other guy, courage. Not enough of it. Need some from whatshisname."
Anthology of Interest II,Mom," Damn this DSL! [She cackles and opens a cage, letting out her flying monkey-sons.] Fly, my stupids! Fly out and get them!"
Anthology of Interest II,Igner," But, Mom, you promised you'd bake monkey cake today."
Anthology of Interest II,Mom," By ""monkey cake"" I meant your ass!"
Anthology of Interest II,Fry," Man, we've been skipping for hours. I need to pull over and take the wiz."
Anthology of Interest II,Zoidberg," What, do I smell or something?"
Anthology of Interest II,Leela, Why did you bring us here?
Anthology of Interest II,Zoidberg, And why did I have to take a cab?
Anthology of Interest II,Mom," I'll tell you why I brought you here, you twice-baked barf bags  Because I've always wanted a daughter to love. You want to get adopted, you little skank?"
Anthology of Interest II,Leela," And live here? And be a witch like you? Yeah, alright. As long as I get to hurt people and not just dance around at the equinox."
Anthology of Interest II,Mom, Absolutely.
Anthology of Interest II,Leela," Oh, Mommy! I found my true home!"
Anthology of Interest II,Bender, Hooray!
Anthology of Interest II,Zoidberg, Alright!
Anthology of Interest II,Fry," That's great, Leela."
Anthology of Interest II,Bender, I've heard worse excuses to drink. [He opens the bottle and it sprays over Mom.] Oops!
Anthology of Interest II,Mom," I'm melting! Oh, who would have thought a small amount of liquid would ever fall on me?"
Anthology of Interest II,Bender," Well, no point letting her go to waste."
Anthology of Interest II,Hermes, [from inside] Yes?
Anthology of Interest II,Leela, We're here to see the Professor.
Anthology of Interest II,Hermes, [from inside] No one sees the mighty Professor.
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," [from inside] Who's there, Hermes? Is it visitors? I want to see them."
Anthology of Interest II,Hermes, [shouting; from inside] It's nobody. Now sign that will I gave you! [He turns to Leela.] He's not here.
Anthology of Interest II,Leela," Oh, for the love of Benji!"
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," I am the Professor, great and ... uh ... forgetful! [Nibbler pulls back the curtain revealing Farnsworth's big head on a small body.] Now, what do you nice kids want?"
Anthology of Interest II,Zoidberg," Nothing! I'm leaving. But if you have extra courage I'd haul it away for you, maybe?"
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," Oh, blithery poop, my cowardly lobster! You don't need courage. After all, who needs courage when you have a gun?"
Anthology of Interest II,Zoidberg," No, world, you put your hands up!"
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," And you, lad, all you need is brain."
Anthology of Interest II,Fry, Why does everyone keep saying that?
Anthology of Interest II,Bender," This is a stick-up. Gimme the bag, old man!"
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," Here you go, my friend. 5000 Professor Land fun bucks."
Anthology of Interest II,Bender," Oh, crap."
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," As for you, young lady, you want to go home, right?"
Anthology of Interest II,Leela," No, not anymore. I wanna stay here and become the new Wicked Witch."
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth," Nonsense. Now click your big, honking boots together three times and wish to go home to Kansas, to live in poverty with your dirt-farming, teetotalling aunt and uncle."
Anthology of Interest II,Leela," Uh, alright. Here I go. [She clicks her boots together three times.] There's no place like-- I wanna be a witch! [She turns into a witch, complete with pointed hat. Everyone gasps and she turns Fry, Farnsworth and Bender into frogs and laughs. Water falls on her from above and she starts to melt.] Oh, no! Help! What's happening?"
Anthology of Interest II,Zoidberg," Uh, sorry. I think there's a problem with your upstairs toilet."
Anthology of Interest II,Bender, Wake up!
Anthology of Interest II,Fry," Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head."
Anthology of Interest II,Leela," I was having the most wonderful dream. [She points at Fry, Amy and Zoidberg.] Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there."
Anthology of Interest II,Fry," Never mind, Professor. She came to."
Anthology of Interest II,Farnsworth, Oh! So close.
Anthology of Interest II,Hermes," There's always next year, Professor. There's always next year."
Anthology of Interest II,,
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," I've never seen a supernova blow up, but if it's anything like my old Chevy Nova, it'll light up the night sky!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Bender," Yeah! Anyone who misses this will regret it the rest of his life. Hey, Fry, could you go make some popcorn?"
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, OK.
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," Let's go, microwave, I'm in a hurry here! [He opens the door and hesitates before he puts it in.] Hm? [He reads the ""Warning  Do Not Put In Microwave"" label, tears it off and chuckles. He puts the packet in the microwave and presses the button. The popcorn fizzles and blue light leaks out of the microwave and begins to engulf the room.] Hey, what smells like blue?"
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela," [shouting] Fry, get up here! It's starting!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth, Focus!
Roswell that Ends Well,Bender," Oh, boy!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela, Oh!
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," Hey, which crazy thing happening are you guys screaming about?"
Roswell that Ends Well,Zoidberg, My head is spinning.
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, Ooh! My popcorn's done!
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, Aw! It's less popped than ever.
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela," I don't know what happened, but we've taken on a lot of clocks. [She indicates the clocks on the floor.] Let's get back home."
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela, Why is there so little traffic around Earth?
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth, And what's this layer of ozone? That's never been there before.
Roswell that Ends Well,Zoidberg, Such noises!
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela," Oh, no! There's no global positioning signal! Navigation is failing."
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, We're gonna crash!
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela," Not if I can help it! [The engines cut out.] Oh, I guess I can't. Everyone, put on your seatbelts."
Roswell that Ends Well,Bender," Ah, those things cost more lives than they save."
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," Bender, are you OK?"
Roswell that Ends Well,Bender, I dunno. I'll try to move my feet.
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela," Alright, here's the plan  Zoidberg, pick up the pieces. Everyone else, take five."
Roswell that Ends Well,Zoidberg, And Zoidberg picks up another piece. The crowd goes wild! [He mimes a cheering crowd. Car headlights shine in his eyes and he shields them.] What is?
Roswell that Ends Well,Man," General, in all my years of covering top secret discoveries with sheets, I've never dramatically revealed anything as shocking as this. Dun-dun-dun! The debris from an alien spaceship."
Roswell that Ends Well,General," Son, I think I can safely say--"
Roswell that Ends Well,Man," As you can see, 1947 is going to be an eventful year for the town of ... Roswell, New Mexico."
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth," Remarkable! According the high-precision digital chronograph it's July 9th, 1947, which would explain why the chronograph has turned into this pin-up calendar."
Roswell that Ends Well,Bender, Wait a second. You mean we travelled through time?
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth, Doy! Some idiot must have put metal in the microwave--
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, Yo!
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth," And the microwave radiation, combined with the gravitons and graviolis from the supernova, blasted us through time itself."
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela, Have you seen today's news?
Roswell that Ends Well,Bender, High school gym renovations on schedule? What a load!
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela," No, over here! [She points at the headline.] [reading] Flying saucer captured!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Bender, That's no flying saucer! That's my ass!
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, My God! This means the flying saucer that crashed in Roswell ... was us!
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth, And the alien they captured was ... was...
Roswell that Ends Well,Zoidberg, Hello! [The general winces.] So what are you guys doing tonight? I'm up for whatever.
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth," Yes, we tore the universe a new space-hole alright! But it's clenching shut fast. Our only hope to get back to our own time is to go through it in, oh, say ... [He looks at his watch.] ... exactly 24 hours."
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela, No problem. The ship's fixed except for the cup holder and I should have that operational within 10 hours.
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth, You've got eight! But a more urgent concern is the microwave. [He picks up the charred microwave.] Without a working one we have no hope of returning to the future.
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela," Well, I'm sure we can buy a microwave somewhere around here. [She turns to Fry.] Meanwhile, you guys sneak onto the army base and rescue Bender's body."
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," Hey, and while we're on the base, I'll visit my grandfather, Enos. He was stationed at Roswell."
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth," Your grandfather? [He leaps up, causing the microwave to shatter on the floor.] Stay away from him, you dim-witted monkey! You mustn't interfere with the past. Don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to do it. In which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, Got it.
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth," If, for example, you were to kill your grandfather, you would cease to exist."
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, But existing is basically all I do!
Roswell that Ends Well,General, What is your purpose here?
Roswell that Ends Well,Zoidberg," [drowsy] Alright, Officer, I'll move along."
Roswell that Ends Well,Man, What the general means is why did you come to Earth?
Roswell that Ends Well,Zoidberg, Not a day goes by I don't ask myself the same question.
Roswell that Ends Well,Sergeant," [shouting] Enos! [Fry gasps and takes Bender's eyes off his head and uses them to zoom in. He sees Enos and a sergeant yelling at him.] Private, I want that toilet bowl so clean I could eat off it! 'Cause I intend to!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Enos," Well gadzooks, Sarge!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," It's him! It's my grandfather, Enos."
Roswell that Ends Well,Sergeant, [shouting] Now prepare my lunch and place it in the latrine at twelve-hundred hours!
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," That Jeep's gonna hit him! And I won't exist anymore! [Screaming, he runs and pushes Enos out of the way of the slow-moving Jeep, which turns right before it gets to them.] Are you crazy? You almost got yourself run over!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Enos, I did? Then I sure am lucky you knocked me onto this pile of rusty bayonets!
Roswell that Ends Well,Bender, Pst! Fry! Stop interfering with history. I don't wanna have to memorise a lot of new kings when I get back.
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," [whispering] I had no choice; I was about to not exist. I could feel myself fading away, like Greg Kinnear."
Roswell that Ends Well,Enos," Well, thanks, soldier. I'm off to make Sarge's lunch! Handling raw chicken, best part of the job! [He licks his fingers.] Mmm! Finger-licking good!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," That's it! This place is too dangerous. We gotta get you out of here! [He stoops to Enos's crotch.] [shouting] Everything's gonna be alright, Dad!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Enos, Well gadzooks! I'd better ask Sarge.
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, [shouting] No time! Run! Run to safety!
Roswell that Ends Well,Man," This experiment will determine what food, if any, the alien eats."
Roswell that Ends Well,Zoidberg," A buffet! Oh, if only I had my wallet with me!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Man," Um, it's free."
Roswell that Ends Well,General, Get me the President.
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela," Fry's from around this time. I'll talk like him. [She approaches a salesman.] Yo, homes! We're looking for a microwave oven."
Roswell that Ends Well,Salesman," Microwave? Never heard of that brand, sweetheart. What you want is the ""Deluxe Gas Princess"". [He indicates an oven.] This beauty has four broilers, a casserole indicator, a fold-out ironing board and, down here, a foot-soaking tub. Since, as a woman, you'll be standing in front of it all day."
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela," Oh, I'm sorry. Now I'll aks you again  Where can we find a mi-cro-wave?"
Roswell that Ends Well,Salesman," Sir, your wife's hysterical, so I'll address this to you. This oven is lightning fast. It takes only five hours to cook a roast."
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth," Ooh, that's good news! You know, you really don't cook enough roasts, Leela. [Leela turns the gas hob on and sets fire to Farnsworth's tie. He turns to the salesman.] Women!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, Thank God I got you off that dangerous army base.
Roswell that Ends Well,Enos," You sure are the helpful type, stranger. Say, you got anything to eat in that there lunchbox? [He reaches into Bender's head and takes out some microchips.] Ooh! Snacks!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Bender, Hey! That's my brain!
Roswell that Ends Well,Enos, Damn! Them crackers cut my mouth up somethin' bad! Let's stop off for a malt.
Roswell that Ends Well,Enos, See that waitress there?
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, Yowza! I know what I want for dessert!
Roswell that Ends Well,Enos," That's my fiancée, Mildred."
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," Grandma Mildred? Uh, no dessert! Just coffee."
Roswell that Ends Well,Mildred," Okie-doke. And for you, Snuggums?"
Roswell that Ends Well,Enos," Uh, I'll have a pie with a fried egg on top."
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, She sure is pretty. You ought to marry her and father some children right away.
Roswell that Ends Well,Enos," Yeah, folks say that. But did you ever get the feeling you're only going with girls 'cause you're supposed to?"
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," What? Don't ever, ever say or think that again! Please! Just concentrate on staying alive. [A flame in the kitchen flares and Fry gasps.] Fire! Look out! [He leans forward and knocks the table over. The cutlery slides off and a knife lands inches from Enos's crotch.] Oh! You almost got neutered."
Roswell that Ends Well,Enos, Well it ain't as bad as getting killed.
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, For me it is! [He stands up.] I'm getting you outta here!
Roswell that Ends Well,Enos, Ow!
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," OK, we're in the middle of nowhere, which is the safest part of nowhere. Just stay put and enjoy this calendar."
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," Safe and sound! Finally, I can continue to exist."
Roswell that Ends Well,Man #2," Three, two, one."
Roswell that Ends Well,Bender, And you are outta here!
Roswell that Ends Well,Mildred, What'll you folks have today?
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth," I'll have the soylent green, with a slice of soylent orange and some soylent coleslaw."
Roswell that Ends Well,Mildred, Pardon?
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela," [whispering] It's the 20th century, Professor."
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth," Oh, right! I'll have a croque monsieur, the paella, two mutton pills and a stein of mead."
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela, I'll just have a small injection of Femislim.
Roswell that Ends Well,Mildred," Uh, two chilli dogs comin' up."
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela," Well, settle in. Without a microwave we're trapped in this time period."
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth," Oh, Lord! We'll have to endure the horrible music of the Big Bopper and then the terrible tragedy of his death."
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela, Wait a second! There's a microwave radar dish at the army base.  We could steal it!
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth," No! That would alter history. Above all else, it is our sacred duty to preserve the past exactly as it was."
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," Well, I killed my grandfather."
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth, Wha?
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela," Wait. If you killed your grandfather, why do you still exist?"
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, I dunno. Maybe God loves me.
Roswell that Ends Well,Mildred," Killed? In an atomic blast? [crying] No, sir, I'm afraid I don't take much solace in the fact that the implosion trigger functioned perfectly."
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," Aw. There, there. If it makes you feel any better, his body was vaporised so there's no chance of him coming back as a zombie."
Roswell that Ends Well,Mildred, [crying] I'm not worried about that.
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, Then you're a braver woman than I.
Roswell that Ends Well,Mildred, You remind me of Enos. Would you mind walking me home?
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," Uh, how far is it?"
Roswell that Ends Well,General," Welcome to Roswell, President Truman."
Roswell that Ends Well,Truman," Fellas, this visit's top secret. No one's to know about it except the senior officers ... [They salute.] ... scientists ... [They nod.] ... and a single conspiracy nutter no one will believe."
Roswell that Ends Well,General," Mr. President, our men have assembled the parts from the alien ship into its original design."
Roswell that Ends Well,Truman, Whistling Dixie! I want this sent to Area 51 for study.
Roswell that Ends Well,General," But, sir, that's where we're building the fake moon landing set."
Roswell that Ends Well,Truman, Then we'll have to really land on the moon. Invent NASA and tell them to get off their fannies!
Roswell that Ends Well,Truman," If you come in peace, surrender or be destroyed. If you're here to make war, we surrender."
Roswell that Ends Well,Zoidberg, Both good. The important thing is I'm meeting new people.
Roswell that Ends Well,Truman, Bushwah! Now what's your mission? Are you planning to make some kind of alien-human hybrid?
Roswell that Ends Well,Zoidberg, Are you coming onto me?
Roswell that Ends Well,Truman, Hot crackers! I take exception to that!
Roswell that Ends Well,Zoidberg, [sexfully] I'm not hearing a no.
Roswell that Ends Well,Truman," Nerks to this space crab! If we want information, we'll have to do us an old-fashioned alien autopsy!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Zoidberg, Hooray!
Roswell that Ends Well,Mildred, [crying] Every little thing reminds me of Enos.
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," Aw, I know how you feel. My grandfather died recently."
Roswell that Ends Well,Mildred," It's all so sad. At times like this, I just need someone to hold me. [She puts her arms around Fry.] Mmm. [sexfully] You like holding me, don't you?"
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," Hey, you know what always cheers you up? Baking me a nice tray of sugar cookies!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Mildred," How 'bout these cookies, sugar?"
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't even exist. But I do exist. Which proves ... you can't really be my grandm--
Roswell that Ends Well,Bender," [from outside] Oh, my God!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth," What the hell have you done, Fry?"
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, Relax! She can't be my grandmother. I figured it all out.
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth," Of course she's your grandmother, you perverted dope! Look!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Mildred," Come back to bed, deary."
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," It's impossible! I mean, if she's my grandmother, who's my grandfather?"
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth, Isn't it obvious? [Fry shakes his head.] You are!
Roswell that Ends Well,Mildred," Did you say something, deary? I'm a bit hard of hearing."
Roswell that Ends Well,Pathologist #1, Commencing excavation of the subject's chest cavity.
Roswell that Ends Well,Zoidberg," And in this corner, Zoidberg! [He laughs.] C'mon! Lighten up! What is this, a funeral?"
Roswell that Ends Well,Pathologist #2, Heart.
Roswell that Ends Well,Zoidberg," Take, I've got four of them."
Roswell that Ends Well,Pathologist #1, Stomach contents  One deviled egg.
Roswell that Ends Well,Zoidberg, Deviled egg?
Roswell that Ends Well,Pathologist #1, The same deviled egg.
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela, Snap out of it!
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth," Start the ship, Leela. Let's just steal the damn radar dish and get back to our own time."
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, But-- But won't that change history?
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth," [sarcastic] Oh, a lesson in not changing history from Mr. I'm-My-Own-Grandpa! Let's get the hell out of here already! Screw history!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Conspiracy Nutter, UFO! UFO!
Roswell that Ends Well,Zoidberg," Hey, don't cut that! I need that to speak!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Pathologist #2," Oh, my!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Truman, Sweet Roosevelt's ghost!
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela, Hi-yah! [She kicks the other pathologist.] Yah! [Truman peers over the edge of the table and she kicks him.] Yah!
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," Take this, Mr. President-- Sir!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Zoidberg, The President is gagging on my gas bladder! What an honour!
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth," Huh, wha? Oh, right!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Sergeant, [shouting] Enos!
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, [shouting; from ship] He's dead! Sorry!
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, Yay!
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth," Choke on that, causality!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Bender, [shouting] 1947 can kiss my shiny metal--
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, Turn around. We've gotta go back for Bender!
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth," Impossible! The supernova time hole is closing! If we don't leave now, we'll never get back to the 31st century."
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, [shouting; from ship] Bender!
Roswell that Ends Well,Zoidberg, There! Good as new!
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela, Don't you need this one?
Roswell that Ends Well,Zoidberg," Oh, no! That's my-- [He gags, chokes and keels over. He gets back up again, smiling.] Gotcha!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," Oh, poor Bender. He must be so lonely right now, trapped a thousand years in the past. Hey! Wait a second!"
Roswell that Ends Well,Leela, Anything?
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry, No. [The metal detector beeps.] Wait!
Roswell that Ends Well,Bender, Ow! Stupid junk!
Roswell that Ends Well,Fry," He's alive! [Leela and Farnsworth cheer. Leela digs and pulls Bender's head from the ground.] Bender, what was it like lying in that hole for a thousand years?"
Roswell that Ends Well,Bender, I was enjoying it until you guys showed up.
Roswell that Ends Well,Farnsworth," Well, now everything is back as it was. And if history doesn't care that out degenerate friend Fry is his own grandfather then who are we to judge?"
Roswell that Ends Well,Bender, Amen!
Roswell that Ends Well,,
Godfellas,Leela, Space pirates!
Godfellas,Fry, Space pirates?
Godfellas,Leela," You know. Pirates, but in space."
Godfellas,Pirate," [on screen] Avast, mateys!"
Godfellas,Pirate," Electronically transfer your space doubloons, afore I send thee to Davey Jarg's locker!"
Godfellas,Bender," [shouting] Hey! Keep it down, you kids! I'm trying to take a nap!"
Godfellas,Fry, Come on! Come on!
Godfellas,Bender," [muttering] Make Bender take a nap in a tube. [He opens the tube, gets in a pushes a torpedo out.] [sexfully] Come back when I've had some sleep, baby!"
Godfellas,Leela, Fry to battlestations. Fire torpedo number three.
Godfellas,Fry, Firing torpedo number three!
Godfellas,Bender, Huh? What?
Godfellas,Leela, That's not torpedo three. That's not torpedo three at all!
Godfellas,Bender," Damn you, Fry and Lee-- [He flies through the pirate ship, leaving a hole in the hull and holding a bag of swag.] --la!"
Godfellas,Pirate, [from ship] Too late do I realise that me children are me only real treasures.
Godfellas,Bender, [shouting] Help! Mechanical man overboard!
Godfellas,Fry," Go after him, Leela!"
Godfellas,Leela, It's no use. We were going full speed when we fired him so he's going even faster than that.
Godfellas,Fry, You mean we can never catch up to him? Not even if we rub the engine with cheetah blood?
Godfellas,Leela," I don't know how to say this, Fry, but Bender is doomed to drift through space ... forever."
Godfellas,Fry," [solemn] He always wanted to drift forever, but through the American Southwest."
Godfellas,Bender," I'm going too fast. I've gotta lose momentum. [He throws swag out of the sack and spins around and slows down. He groans.] I'm gonna spend eternity alone with barely any swag. [He takes a watch out of the sack.] Ooh! Hey, universe, check out the dude with the Rolex! [He takes out a candelabra.] Wow! Ostentatious! [He sticks it to his door.] Except what good is a candelabra without-- Wait! I know! [He pulls a piano out of his chest cabinet, puts the candelabra on it and plays Polonaise in C Minor.] Ah, the pity. Fated to drift forever through the void as gravity's plaything. Oh, cruel fate, to be thusly boned. Ask not for whom the bone bones. It bones for thee. The only thing that keeps me sane is the thought that I have all eternity in which to perfect my art. [He plays a bad note and groans. He tries again, plays another bad note and growls.] Damn you!"
Godfellas,Bender," There! Now when I'm found in a million years people will know what the score was. [An object hits him.] Hey! what's bombarding me? [More objects hit him.] Oh, no! An asteroid field. If even a pea-sized asteroid were to whiz through my skull it could-- [One whizzes through his skull.] Ow! Hurt slightly! [More asteroids hit him and one becomes embedded in his door. He clears the asteroid field.] Well that was fun. Now for eons of loneliness."
Godfellas,Bender, Huh?
Godfellas,Shrimpkin Priest," Fellow Shrimpkins, behold him who hath taken us unto his breast."
Godfellas,Bender, Holy frijoles!
Godfellas,Shrimpkin Priest, All bow before the great Metal Lord!
Godfellas,Bender," Worshippers? This ought to liven up my endless, tragic voyage."
Godfellas,Shrimpkin Priest, All hail the Metal Lord!
Godfellas,Shrimpkins, [chanting] So hailed!
Godfellas,Bender," Hmm. Those peewees think I'm God, huh? Hard to blame 'em! [He picks one up and he screams. He places the Shrimpkin on his eyes.] I am the Metal Lord. Who are you?"
Godfellas,Malachi," I am called Malachi, Lord. It means, um, ""He who really loves the Metal Lord""."
Godfellas,Bender," Listen here, Malachi. Time for a religious donation. Hand over your wallet."
Godfellas,Malachi," But, Lord, we are a poor and simple folk."
Godfellas,Bender," Poor? Oh, crap."
Godfellas,Malachi," Pity me not, for I am richened by the love of my family."
Godfellas,Malachi's Wife," What art thou doing, Malachi Jr.?"
Godfellas,Malachi Jr., I'm practising to hug Daddy when he gets back from God. [He hugs the pot.] Mmm! Mmm!
Godfellas,Bender," Eck! Gag unto me with a spoon! Malachi, it's high time I laid down a few commandments. You got a chisel? Take this down. [He clears his throat.] Number one..."
Godfellas,Malachi, Behold  The One Commandment.
Godfellas,Bender, [shouting] Make it a double!
Godfellas,Fry," Can you find him, Professor?"
Godfellas,Farnsworth, No. I'm afraid the Smellescope isn't powerful enough. Bender's odour is so mild it's being overpowered by local sources.
Godfellas,Zoidberg, Hooray! People are paying attention to me!
Godfellas,Amy," Fry, we brought someone to cheer you up."
Godfellas,Hermes, His name is Helper and he's eager to be your new best friend.
Godfellas,Helper," Hello there, chum. I understand you miss your buddy. Have a pudding pop!"
Godfellas,Fry," No, thanks, I don't--"
Godfellas,Helper, Who wants to go to an amusement park?
Godfellas,Fry," Well, I guess that sounds OK."
Godfellas,Helper," Have a good time. Hey, I heard your friend Bender is back."
Godfellas,Fry, What? Really?
Godfellas,Helper, No. I just thought you would enjoy that for a moment.
Godfellas,Bender," Ooh! Microbrewed! My guys did alright! I think I'll make my countenance to shine down upon them. [He reaches out and picks up Malachi.] Malachi, good work. There's no slowing down with the Metal Lord tonight."
Godfellas,Malachi," Yes, tonight is kind of special."
Godfellas,Bender, Wait a second. Did you rip off your own arm as a joke?
Godfellas,Malachi," Nay. Like most of your followers, I was maimed while building the Great Brewery. [The Shrimpkins lack various limbs and behind them is a large graveyard.] Others died from the pestilent fumes it spewed forth. [On the porch of her home, Malachi's wife sits with the baby.] And, of course, the liquor industry attracted organised crime."
Godfellas,Bender," It's all my fault. Malachi, tell thy people that the Lord is moved by their plight."
Godfellas,Malachi's Wife," Malachi Jr., no!"
Godfellas,Malachi Jr.," Daddy, I can't hold much longer. My arms are tired from hugging."
Godfellas,Malachi," Save him! Save my son, oh Metal Lord!"
Godfellas,Bender," This looks like a job for God! [He pulls Malachi Jr. out of the tear river and puts him down on the bank. Father and son hug and the Shrimpkins gasp and bow.] What the-- Malachi, what manner of deal is this with the chanting?"
Godfellas,Malachi, They saw you save my son. Now everyone is praying for their own miracles.
Godfellas,Bender, Very well. What do they want?
Godfellas,Malachi, The people of that village pray for wealth.
Godfellas,Bender," Um, that was a practice miracle. Who's next?"
Godfellas,Malachi, The farmers pray for sunlight so their barley might make a more refreshing beer for today's God on the go.
Godfellas,Bender," Very well. Let there be light. [He closes his eye visor and reflects the rays of a star onto the farmers' fields. They cheer but the fields burst into flames and so do the farmers.] I got it! I got it! [He blows the flames out and also blows several Shrimpkins off his body and into space.] Um, when you're writing the Bible, you might want to omit that last miracle."
Godfellas,Fry," He decided not to let go. [He puts the picture down and looks at one on the wall of Bender sat on a throne dressed as Napoleon.] I can't believe you're gone. I won't! If I can't reach you physically, I'll just have to try something desperate and crazy!"
Godfellas,Fry," So that's my story, Father Changstein el Gamahl. Is there anything religion can do to help me find my friend?"
Godfellas,Changstein el Gamahl," Well, we could join together in prayer."
Godfellas,Fry, Uh-huh. But is there anything useful we can do?
Godfellas,Changstein el Gamahl, No.
Godfellas,Gypsy," Sure I hold séance, channel your friend, no problem. Insert coin. [Fry inserts 5 cents and the Gypsy moans as she ""channels"" Bender.] I am your friend, Bonder."
Godfellas,Fry, Bonder? Is it really you?
Godfellas,Gypsy, Yes. I am fine. Give the gypsy $10.
Godfellas,Fry," Wait a minute! Bender's name isn't Bonder, it's Bender. You're a fraud!"
Godfellas,Gypsy," Look, you want false hope or not?"
Godfellas,Fry, Only if you don't have any real hope.
Godfellas,Gypsy," Well, there is perhaps one way. Have you heard of the Monks of Dschubba?"
Godfellas,Fry, I've not heard of them.
Godfellas,Gypsy," They are an ancient order that believes God exists somewhere in the depths of space. They have built the universe's most powerful radio telescope, high in the Himalayas, to search for him."
Godfellas,Fry, You think they'd let me use it to look for Bender?
Godfellas,Gypsy," What am I, psychic? I mean, yes! Yes, I'm-I'm sure they will. Yes."
Godfellas,Malachi," Oh, Metal Lord, hear my prayer."
Godfellas,Bender," [irate] Yes, Malachi, what is it this time?"
Godfellas,Malachi," My Lord, the infidels on your back no longer believe in you. They say their prayers go unheeded."
Godfellas,Bender, Of course they're unheeded. How am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass?
Godfellas,Malachi, They talk of war against the faithful. I beseech thee. Rise up against them. Smite someone who deserves it for once.
Godfellas,Bender," Malachi, every time I interfere, I only make things worse. You're best off solving your own problems."
Godfellas,Malachi, But-But Metal Lord.
Godfellas,Bender," What part of ""nay"" doesn't thou understand?"
Godfellas,Fry," Sir, I'm outfitting an expedition to a monastery high in the Himalayas. I'll need a long-sleeved coat."
Godfellas,Leela," Look, I miss Bender almost half as much as you do but you can't bring him back this way. It's hopeless."
Godfellas,Fry," You can't give up hope just because it's hopeless. You gotta hope even more and cover your ears and go ""blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!"" [He is still covering his ears.] [shouting] I'd also like a pack mule."
Godfellas,Salesman," [shouting] At once, sir!"
Godfellas,Leela," Well, you obviously won't listen to reason, so I guess I'll listen to idiotic-ness and come with you. But we'll need a sherpa to guide us."
Godfellas,Bender," Now that's one Bible that doesn't disappoint on every page! Looks like society's running pretty well without my meddling-- [Bombers fly around from Bender's ass and drop bombs on the Shrimpkin village.] Atomic bombs? Oh, no! Those unbelievers from my backside must have found my nuclear pile!"
Godfellas,Malachi," Fear not, my Lord. We shall be with you soon."
Godfellas,Bender, You're with me now. This is the maximum level of being with me!
Godfellas,Malachi, We will solve our own problems as you commanded. The time has come to convert the unbelievers.
Godfellas,Bender, Convert them?
Godfellas,Malachi, To radioactive vapour!
Godfellas,Malachi Jr.," Look, Daddy! I'm hugging God. Mmm! Mmm! Maybe if I hug him real hard he'll save us from--"
Godfellas,Bender, [crying] No! [More bombs explode on him.] [laughing] Ooh! It tickles!
Godfellas,Bender, Hello? Is anyone still alive? How about in the porno theatre? [He takes the roof off Ezekiel's Nasty House.] Don't be embarrassed. [He groans.] [crying] They're dead. All dead. Who would have known playing God could have such terrible consequences?
Godfellas,Leela," [shouting] Fry, if I drop dead from exhaustion, make sure my body freezes in a dignified position. None of that ""huddled over for warmth"" crap."
Godfellas,Namgyal, Behold. The Monastery of Dschubba. I must leave you now for I am not holy enough to enter.
Godfellas,Fry, OK.
Godfellas,Leela, Looks rickety. We'd better test it.
Godfellas,Female Voice, Welcome to our monastery. Please stand to one side to let faster pilgrims by.
Godfellas,Bender, Hey! That galaxy's signalling in binary. I gotta signal back. But I only know enough binary to ask where the bathroom is. [shouting] You speak English?
Godfellas,Galaxy, I do now.
Godfellas,Bender, What are you? Some kind of galactic computer?
Godfellas,Galaxy," Possible. I am user friendly, my good chum."
Godfellas,Bender, Who built you?
Godfellas,Galaxy, I have always been.
Godfellas,Bender," Oh, my God. Are you God?"
Godfellas,"""God"""," Possible. I do feel compassion for all living things, my good chum."
Godfellas,Bender," But why would God think in binary? Unless ... you're not God, but the remains of a computerised space probe that collided with God."
Godfellas,"""God""", That seems probable.
Godfellas,Monk #1," A member of our brotherhood sits at these controls every hour of every day, scanning the heavens for God."
Godfellas,Monk #2," There he is! No. No, wait, no."
Godfellas,Leela, How long have you been at it?
Godfellas,Monk #1," 700 years. We've not yet examined one-ten-millionth of the sky. But we will go on until we find the Almighty, even if it takes till the end of time."
Godfellas,Fry, And then what?
Godfellas,Monk #1," Then we utter unto him a short prayer. You see, the telescope is also an amplifying transmitter."
Godfellas,Leela, Sort of like a giant karaoke machine?
Godfellas,Monk #1, Not really. Would you like to see our giant karaoke machine?
Godfellas,Leela, Not really.
Godfellas,Fry," Hmm. Finding God. That-That's important, yeah. But you know what might be a treat for everyone? If you let me use the telescope to find my lost friend, Bender."
Godfellas,Monk #1," I don't know what to say, other than ""absolutely not"". Your loss is a tragedy but our work--"
Godfellas,Fry," Aw, come on! You guys have forever to look for God. All I'm asking is one measly lifetime to find my friend."
Godfellas,Monk #2, He speaks out of love for his friend. Perhaps that love in his heart is God.
Godfellas,Monk #1," Oh, how convenient! A theory about God that doesn't require looking through a telescope. Get back to work!"
Godfellas,Fry, That telescope is as much mine as anybody's. I'm using it whether you give me permission or not.
Godfellas,Leela," Hi-yah! Your order may be famous for your martial arts, but I've never met a holy man I couldn't clobber."
Godfellas,Monk #1," Actually, we only practise martial arts as a form of meditation. We are a strictly non-violent sect."
Godfellas,Leela, Oh. Then get in the laundry room or I'll kick your butts!
Godfellas,Monk #3, This is the worst crazy sect I've ever been in.
Godfellas,Bender," So, do you know what I'm gonna do before I do it?"
Godfellas,"""God""", Yes.
Godfellas,Bender, What if I do something different?
Godfellas,"""God""", Then I don't know that.
Godfellas,Bender," Cool! Cool! I bet a lot of people pray to you, huh?"
Godfellas,"""God"""," Yes. But there are so many asking so much. After a while, you just sorta tune it out."
Godfellas,Bender," Y'know, I was God once."
Godfellas,"""God"""," Yes, I saw. You were doing well until everyone died."
Godfellas,Bender," It was awful. I tried helping them, I tried not helping them but in the end I couldn't do them any good. Do you think what I did was wrong?"
Godfellas,"""God""", Right and wrong are just words. What matters is what you do.
Godfellas,Bender," Yeah I know, that's why I asked if what I did-- Forget it."
Godfellas,"""God"""," Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you. And if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch like a safecracker or a pickpocket."
Godfellas,Bender, Or a guy who burns down the bar for the insurance money.
Godfellas,"""God"""," Yes, if you make it look like an electrical thing. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all."
Godfellas,Bender, Does that mean you wouldn't send me back to Earth even if I prayed to you?
Godfellas,"""God""", Earth? Which way is that?
Godfellas,Bender, [sadly] I don't know.
Godfellas,Fry, [shouting] Bender? Bender?
Godfellas,Monk #2, [from laundry room] Let us out! We cooked our shoes in the dryer and ate them. Now we're bored.
Godfellas,Fry, [shouting] Hello? Has anyone out there seen Bender?
Godfellas,H.G. Blob, [on speaker] No! Quit asking.
Godfellas,Leela," Fry, it's been three days. And even if you stay here the rest of your life, there is virtually no chance of finding him. It's time to give up."
Godfellas,Fry," [sad] You're right. I'm never gonna see him again. I know he was evil and on more than one occasion he-he actually stole my blood. [He spins the dish controller.] But still, I wish I had Bender back."
Godfellas,"""God""", Huh?
Godfellas,Bender, Huh? Wha? You say something?
Godfellas,"""God"""," No, no. Well, so long. Remember what we talked about."
Godfellas,Bender," Hot, hot, hot, hot!"
Godfellas,Fry, Bender! It's a miracle! [He hugs him and burns himself.] Ow!
Godfellas,Leela," This is, by a wide margin, the least likely thing that has ever happened."
Godfellas,Bender," Guys, you'll never believe what happened. First I was God, then I met God!"
Godfellas,Fry, We climbed a mountain and locked up some monks.
Godfellas,Leela," Oh, no! The monks! We forgot to let them out of the laundry room."
Godfellas,Fry," Do we have to? I mean, they're monks. I'm sure their God will let them out or at least give them more shoes to eat."
Godfellas,Bender," Fat chance! You can't count on God for jack. He pretty much told me so himself. Now come on. If we don't save those monks, no one will!"
Godfellas,"""God"""," When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all."
Godfellas,,
Future Stock,Man, Yes! Good thing I noticed the similar shapes.
Future Stock,Hermes," [from behind curtain] Planet Express stockholders, I present our chief executive officer, Professor Hubert Farnsworth."
Future Stock,Farnsworth, Oh!
Future Stock,Amy, There he is!
Future Stock,Hattie, [shouting] Take it off!
Future Stock,Farnsworth, Where am I?
Future Stock,Hermes, Move forward. Walk into the light.
Future Stock,Farnsworth," Oh, God, I'm dead! Well, no matter. [He takes some cards out of his coat and walks under the spotlight to the lectern.] [reading] Thank you all for coming. I don't recognise any of you, nor can I recall why I am here. Now, without further ado, a film highlighting Planet Express Inc.'s latest fiscal year."
Future Stock,Narrator," [voice-over; in movie] Planet Express is on the move. For this hip, young delivery company, tomorrow is today and today is yesterday. You heard me. [The ship zooms off and the scene cuts to Fry handing a package to Kug.] It was a year of soaring profits and significant one-time losses."
Future Stock,Fry, [whispering] Psst! Watching myself work is making me hungry. Help me find some food somewhere.
Future Stock,Zoidberg," I'll not only help you find it, I'll help you do more to it!"
Future Stock,Fry," Ooh! A Bot Mitzvah. Shalom, hunger! Shalom, free food!"
Future Stock,Robot #1, No shellfish!
Future Stock,Zoidberg, That is so unfair!
Future Stock,Pig, Tell me about it.
Future Stock,Fry, So what's the deal? You guys don't believe in Robot Jesus?
Future Stock,Rabbi-bot, We believe he was built and that he was a very well programmed robot. But he wasn't our Messiah.
Future Stock,Narrator," [voice-over; in movie] And so our company flames onwards. Planet Express  Limitless potential, boundless horizons, the unstoppable juggernaut of the corporate universe."
Future Stock,Hermes," It's been a terrible year, people. The company is on the verge of bankruptcy."
Future Stock,Leela, But the movie--
Future Stock,Hermes," Was a substantial loss for the company. [A pie chart appears on the screen showing a large green slice and a small blue slice.] The blue slice represents the money we earned from shipping packages, while the green slice represents an $8 bank error in our favour."
Future Stock,Leela, This toads the wet sprocket. What about out thousands of shares of stock?
Future Stock,Hermes, Worthless.
Future Stock,Bender, [shouting] I'll kill you!
Future Stock,Hattie, I own one share of Planet kajiggers so I'm entitled to some answers. Question 1  Why does no one visit me in my home?
Future Stock,Farnsworth, 'Cause your apartment smells like Polygrip and cat pee.
Future Stock,Fry, This is perfect for me.
Future Stock,Zoidberg," Question  Do you have to have been cryogenically frozen to get the free-- [The man slams the door in his face.] You didn't let me finish. I was going to say ""to get the free food""."
Future Stock,Joe, My name's Joe and I'm a defrostee.
Future Stock,All," [monotonous] Hello, Joe."
Future Stock,Joe," When I was frozen, giant carrots ruled the Earth, but now they don't. It takes some getting used to."
Future Stock,Steve Castle," Back in the 1980's, I was the toast of Wall Street. I was having whiskey with Boesky and cookies with Milken. But then, I was diagnosed with terminal boneitis."
Future Stock,Fry, Boneitis? Pft! That's a funny name for a horrible disease.
Future Stock,Steve Castle," There was no cure at the time. One drug company was close but I arranged a hostile takeover and sold off all the assets. Made a cool hundred mil. [He laughs and coughs. The group applauds.] Naturally I froze myself until a cure was found. Now here I am, ready to sleaze my way back to the top, 80's style!"
Future Stock,Caveman," As a caveman frozen in a glacier, I face different challenges. [crying] The hardest thing was seeing my wife on display in the British Museum."
Future Stock,Fry," [whispering] Hey, buddy, I'm from the same time as you. Remember that song, Safety Dance?"
Future Stock,Steve Castle, Sure do! We can dance!
Future Stock,Fry," Y'know, that dance wasn't as safe as they said it was."
Future Stock,Steve Castle," I tell you  Two go-go 80's Reagan-auts like us, we could rule this world!"
Future Stock,Fry, No question!
Future Stock,Steve Castle, If only someone would give us a shot.
Future Stock,Fry," They're scared of our raw power. Oh, but if you want a job, I could beg everyone at the company where I work."
Future Stock,Steve Castle, Awesome. Awesome to the max!
Future Stock,Hermes," And finally, the post office meter is for business mail only."
Future Stock,Bender," Aw, come on! I've got a lot of ransom notes to send!"
Future Stock,Hattie, Enough talk. It's time for action. I move that everyone come to my apartment to snuggle my cat.
Future Stock,Scruffy, Second.
Future Stock,Farnsworth, I move that your cat stinks and is ugly.
Future Stock,Scruffy, Second.
Future Stock,Hattie, I move that we vote on a new chief executive officer and oust this old creep. And also that make cat smells good and is pretty.
Future Stock,Scruffy, Second.
Future Stock,Hermes, Very well. I nominate the Professor.
Future Stock,Amy, Second.
Future Stock,Leela, Second.
Future Stock,Bender, Second.
Future Stock,Farnsworth, I'm your man.
Future Stock,Leela," I vote my 10,000 shares for the Professor."
Future Stock,Hermes," Yeah, the Professor!"
Future Stock,Farnsworth, Me!
Future Stock,Fry," I nominate That Guy. Not just because he has a suit but because he knows about business and stuff and he has a tie. [Everyone mutters. Fry pulls out a crumpled piece of paper from his jacket.] My shares still count if they went through the washing machine, right?"
Future Stock,Hermes," Well, if I know anything about which number is bigger than the other number, I'd say that--"
Future Stock,Scruffy," Now hold on there. Scruffy votes his 40,000 shares for the mysterious stranger."
Future Stock,Leela," 40,000? How come you have four-times as much stock as the rest of us?"
Future Stock,Scruffy, Scruffy believes in this company.
Future Stock,Hermes," Then we have a tie. And in the event of a tie, the Professor, as the current CEO remains--"
Future Stock,Hattie," I demand the floor. I may only have one share but I get to vote same as anyone. And I'm voting against the cat-hater. [She pulls a cat out of her handbag.] Isn't that right, kitty? [The cat meows.] Hey! You ate my change!"
Future Stock,Hermes, Then it's settled. The new chief executive officer of Planet Express corporation is That Guy.
Future Stock,Hermes," Please welcome our new chief executive officer, That Guy."
Future Stock,Steve Castle, Let's cut to the chase. There are two kinds of people  Sheep and sharks. Anyone who's a sheep is fired. Who's a sheep?
Future Stock,Zoidberg," Uh, excuse me? Which is the one people like to hug?"
Future Stock,Steve Castle, Gutsy question. You're a shark. Sharks are winners and they don't look back 'cause they don't have necks. Necks are for sheep. [Everyone sinks down and covers their necks.] I am proud to be the shepherd of this herd of sharks and I am gonna lead you to the top in this industry of ... of--
Future Stock,Fry, [whispering] Package delivery.
Future Stock,Steve Castle," Package delivery? Oh, God! [He covers his face.] Fantastic! Now, the first order of business is to blame everything on the guy before me. Professor?"
Future Stock,Farnsworth, I'll ruin you like I ruined this company.
Future Stock,Steve Castle, Terrific. Question number one  What was your overall business plan?
Future Stock,Farnsworth," Um, business plan, uh, yes. I keep it here, right next to my heart."
Future Stock,Steve Castle," This isn't a business plan, it's an escape plan."
Future Stock,Farnsworth," So long, suckers!"
Future Stock,Steve Castle," Fry, as a fellow 80's dollar-jockey, I'm making you my new vice chairman."
Future Stock,Fry, I'm rollin' up the corporate ramp.
Future Stock,Zoidberg, It's the end of the line!
Future Stock,Hermes, We're ruined!
Future Stock,Scruffy, What fevered dream is this that bids to tear this company in twain?
Future Stock,Monster," Thank you, come again!"
Future Stock,Steve Castle, That's what I call a hostile makeover! Hair gel?
Future Stock,Fry," No, thanks. I make my own."
Future Stock,Steve Castle," This company's gonna shoot straight to the top and stay there, like Cindy Lauper! I ask you  Who is the number one delivery service on Earth?"
Future Stock,Zoidberg," Is it Planet Express, master?"
Future Stock,Steve Castle," Is this guy a shark, or what? Seriously though, we stink out loud. Here's the big enchirito. [He opens the blind revealing Mom's building. The sign on the top of the building shows Mom bottle-feeding a parcel like a baby.] Mom's Friendly Delivery Company."
Future Stock,Hermes, We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil. Ours is small and neutral.
Future Stock,Steve Castle, Switzerland is small and neutral. We're more like Germany; ambitious and misunderstood.
Future Stock,Amy," Look, everyone wants to be like Germany but do we really have the pure strength of will?"
Future Stock,Steve Castle, I say we do! Now are we gonna let ourselves get beaten by an old lady?
Future Stock,Zoidberg," Yes, my liege!"
Future Stock,Fry," No, we're not. And as vice chairman, I believe I speak for the entire board when I issue this challenge to Mom. [He pulls his trousers down and moons Mom.] Look at my butt!"
Future Stock,Mom," You call that a pressed ham? Walt, hit the retaliate button."
Future Stock,Walt, Uh ... um ... hmm ... let's see.
Future Stock,Mom, [shouting] Any button! They all retaliate!
Future Stock,Fry," Woo! Yeah! Hit him, hit him, hit him! [He laughs.] Now this is the high life; watching apes mangle each other near celebrities."
Future Stock,Steve Castle, In my day we went to coke parties but the principle's the same.
Future Stock,Calculon," Get your stinkin' trike off me, you damn dirty ape."
Future Stock,Steve Castle," Listen, big guy, now that you're my protégé, it's time I cut you in on the secret to success. Any guesses?"
Future Stock,Fry," Uh, work really, really hard?"
Future Stock,Steve Castle, No.
Future Stock,Fry," Oh, thank God!"
Future Stock,Steve Castle," It's all about appearances. That's why it's time to update our company's stodgy image and give it the sleek, dazzling veneer of the 1980's!"
Future Stock,Fry," This company's on the fast track to the ""It"" list. Blast back kudos all around!"
Future Stock,Leela," Uh, hello? We haven't made one delivery since you two took over."
Future Stock,Steve Castle," Delivery has nothing to do with the delivery business. Image, people, image! Scope out this new ad!"
Future Stock,Mom," [on screen; in movie] We are all one, with one mind, one purpose and one act. Our enemies shall be eaten by squirrels. [The delivery woman starts spinning around.] We shall bow down and worship to ourselves. [The woman hurls the package at the screen.] We shall prevail!"
Future Stock,Man, [in movie] Hey! We were watching that!
Future Stock,Leela, That was terrible! People won't even know what we do.
Future Stock,Bender," I don't even know what we do. Nah, just kidding! What are, like, a bus or something?"
Future Stock,Leela," Did you approve that awful ad, Fry?"
Future Stock,Fry," Yes I did, Leels. And I'll tell you why. Because it grows the brand."
Future Stock,Leela," Oh, Lord!"
Future Stock,Zoidberg," This company's circling the drain, I tell you. I'd sell my stock right now for a sandwich!"
Future Stock,Steve Castle, Sold!
Future Stock,Zoidberg, A complete sangwich? [He laughs.] You got fleeced! I would have settled for a hard roll with ketchup inside!
Future Stock,Mom," What is this moose drip? [She opens the magazines and holograms of Fry and Steve Castle wearing crowns appear under the headline ""The New Delivery Kings?"".] [reading] The new delivery kings? [talking] I'm sick of hearing about those turtle squirts!"
Future Stock,Igner," But they're kings, Mommy!"
Future Stock,Mom," Jam a bastard in it, you crap!"
Future Stock,Elzar," Enjoy our private dining room, folks. This is where we serve our richest, most successful chumps!"
Future Stock,Fry," Tonight, that's us!"
Future Stock,Steve Castle, What have you got that's really overpriced?
Future Stock,Elzar, Everything.
Future Stock,Steve Castle, Bring me that.
Future Stock,Fry, Make it two. And a glass of all your water.
Future Stock,Steve Castle," OK, let's work on your execu-speak. I'm worried about ""blank""."
Future Stock,Fry," Don't you worry about ""blank"". Let me worry about ""blank""."
Future Stock,Steve Castle," Good. I also would have accepted, ""Blank? Blank? You're not looking at the big picture!"""
Future Stock,Fry, [weakly] What a pleasant surprise!
Future Stock,Mom," Shut up, booger blaster! It's time the three of us had a talk."
Future Stock,Steve Castle," I'll handle this, Fry. You get back to the farm, shift some paradigms, revolutionise outside the box."
Future Stock,Fry," I'm on it. But if you need me, you know where I'll be."
Future Stock,Fry," [muttering] Call me a ""booger blaster""! I'll blast a booger so hard that--"
Future Stock,Leela," Fry, we're worried about Planet Express."
Future Stock,Fry," Don't you worry about Planet Express. Let me worry about ""blank""."
Future Stock,Hermes, That Guy is nothing but a flashy con man! And you've been hypnotised by his swinging baloney!
Future Stock,Leela," You've changed, Fry."
Future Stock,Fry, What? I haven't changed. [He presses his intercom.] Suz? Have I changed?
Future Stock,Suz," [on intercom] No, sir, Mr. Fry."
Future Stock,Fry," Thanks, doll."
Future Stock,Leela, I don't care what Ms. Johnson says. That Guy's turning this place into some kind of business.
Future Stock,Farnsworth," This isn't a business. I've always thought of it more as a source of cheap labour, like a family."
Future Stock,Fry," You're right, Professor. We might not be a traditional family like the Murphy's next door or the lesbian coven across the street. But we are a family and That Guy understands that."
Future Stock,Steve Castle, [on screen] Everyone's fired and we're out of business.
Future Stock,Amy," Oh, no!"
Future Stock,Hermes, How?
Future Stock,Steve Castle, [on screen] I'm gonna sell Planet Express to Mom so she can gut the company and eliminate us as competitors.
Future Stock,Mom," [on screen] Don't let the door hit you on the way out, 'cause I don't want ass prints on my new door!"
Future Stock,Fry," Uh, Ms. Johnson? Please bring in some more chair fuel."
Future Stock,Fry, I had no idea the company would be sold. I was just an innocent suck-up. You've gotta believe me!
Future Stock,Leela, Just leave us alone and let us clear out our lockers.
Future Stock,Bender, Yeah!
Future Stock,Amy," [crying] It's so sad, where will I go? What will I do?"
Future Stock,Lackey," You have Mrs. Darlinghaven's cotillion at 7, ma'am."
Future Stock,Amy, [crying] Oh. That'll be fun.
Future Stock,Fry," Ms. Johnson, you've never lied to me. Am I still a good person?"
Future Stock,Suz," [on intercom] I don't know, sir. I'm a program built into the intercom."
Future Stock,Fry," I've got to redeem myself. Somehow, sometime, for some reason. I'll block this takeover!"
Future Stock,Suz," [on intercom] Mr. Fry, your two o'clock magician is here."
Future Stock,Fry," Believe it or not, I have more important things to do today than laugh and clap my hands. [He gets his hat and coat then hesitates.] Reschedule."
Future Stock,Broker-bot #1, [shouting] Sell 100 soylent beans!
Future Stock,Broker-bot #2," [shouting] Buy 3,000 cornbellies!"
Future Stock,Broker-bot #3, [shouting] 200 canned whoop-ass!
Future Stock,Broker-bot #1, [shouting] Three big bags of trash!
Future Stock,Jor-El," Attention, please. The takeover of PlanEx Corp. by Mom's Delivery Company will take place in the business centre in 10 minutes. I am Jor-El, master of scheduling!"
Future Stock,Steve Castle," OK. We've got the hot tub hot, the wine cooler's cool. It's Hammer time!"
Future Stock,Bender, You suck!
Future Stock,Mom," According to regulations, both companies must approve the takeover. Planet Express shareholders, cast your votes."
Future Stock,Hermes, Great Bonda of Uganda! We can vote against it!
Future Stock,Bender, I'll vote it down like a raise for school teachers!
Future Stock,Bender, What the--?
Future Stock,Hattie, How the--?
Future Stock,Amy," Oh, no!"
Future Stock,Steve Castle, I neglected to mention that the shares I bought from Dr. Zoidberg gave me majority control.
Future Stock,Leela, Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?
Future Stock,Hermes, The shares were worthless and he kept asking for toilet paper.
Future Stock,Mom, And now if Momcorp shareholders will cast their ballots.
Future Stock,Igner," Um ... uh... [He votes and a new total for ""Pat Buchanan"" appears. Larry and Walt glare at him.] Uh, the ballot was confusing."
Future Stock,Mom, How about a hand recount?
Future Stock,Igner, OK. [She slaps him.] Ow!
Future Stock,Mom, The takeover of Planet Express is approved.
Future Stock,Amy, This stinks!
Future Stock,Lackey, Madam is outraged.
Future Stock,Steve Castle," Security, I want that bunch of rowdies outta here."
Future Stock,Bender, Hold on a minute!
Future Stock,Scruffy, Hey! Hey!
Future Stock,Mom," Momcorp will now purchase all outstanding shares of Planet Express at the current market price, which is "
Future Stock,Jor-El, 107.
Future Stock,Bender, Ow! And also it hurt my feelings!
Future Stock,Horrible Gelatinous Stockbroker, What are you solids griping about? Your shares are worth $107 apiece.
Future Stock,Leela," They are? Oh, my God! I'm a millionaire! Suddenly I have an opinion about that capital gains tax!"
Future Stock,Bender, Yeah! Alright!
Future Stock,Amy, I'm even richer!
Future Stock,Zoidberg," Oh! I have no shares! [He cries.] Wait! My sangwich! Has it also appreciated in value? [His sandwich has turned green.] Please, oh, please!"
Future Stock,Hermes," You didn't even refrigerate it, you spineless lobster!"
Future Stock,Zoidberg, You had to drag spines into this!
Future Stock,Fry," [on screen] As vice chairman of Planet Express, I'd like to say a few words. There comes a time for every man who becomes rich and deserts his friends, when he goes back how it was. For me, that time is now."
Future Stock,Fry," So I ask you, as a friend, won't you stop this deal?"
Future Stock,Steve Castle," Fry, I'm an 80's guy. Friendship to me means that for two bucks I'd beat you with a pool cue till you got detached retinas. The deal will go ahead as-- [His fingers and jaw suddenly twist. He screams. He falls to the floor and his bones crack and twist.] My bones!"
Future Stock,Fry," Oh, my God! His boneitis!"
Future Stock,Steve Castle," I was so busy being an 80's guy, I forgot to cure it. [He twists some more.] My only regret is ... that I have ... boneitis!"
Future Stock,Fry, He's dead.
Future Stock,Mom," Pry out his fillings, feed him to the jackals and let's get on with the sale."
Future Stock,Fry," I don't think so. 'Cause, as vice chairman of the company, I gain voting control of his shares."
Future Stock,Mom," Don't be a fool, you idiot!"
Future Stock,Fry," I'll be whatever I wanna do! That Guy was the greatest businessman that ever lived. And before his mysterious death, he taught me everything he knew. [The stock price changes to 114.] But some things I had to learn myself. [It changes to 99.] I learned that money is fine but in the end what counts is people ... [57.] ... people you love. [46.] You can't put a price on that. [28.] So I'm giving up control of the company ... [107.] ... to a man of enormous experience ... [115.] ... Professor ... [150.] ... Hubert Farnsworth."
Future Stock,Farnsworth," Oh, uh, what? I'm awake, I'm awake!"
Future Stock,Bender," Fry! Stop doing the right thing, you jerk!"
Future Stock,Leela," Let Mom buy the company! We all wanna be filthy, stinking rich!"
Future Stock,Zoidberg," Trust me, two out of three doesn't cut it!"
Future Stock,Fry, You mean you'd rather be rich than work together?
Future Stock,Leela," Hell, yeah!"
Future Stock,Fry," In my whole life, this company was the only place I'd ever really felt at home. If being millionaires is more important to you than our--"
Future Stock,Bender, It is!
Future Stock,Fry," Friendship, then I'll sell Planet Express, for you."
Future Stock,Hattie," ""Millionaires"" nothing! The stock's only worth three kajiggers!"
Future Stock,Bender," Oh, come on!"
Future Stock,Hermes, My Jah! It's worth less now than when it was worthless!
Future Stock,Fry, It is? Yahoo! We're poor no matter what I do! The deal is off!
Future Stock,Zoidberg, Aha! Once again the conservative sangwich-heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor! [He eats the sandwich.] Oh! I'm ruined. [He cries.] Why? Why?
Future Stock,Fry," Look, so we're not millionaires. At least we all still get to work together."
Future Stock,Bender, Shut your fat mouth!
Future Stock,Fry, [shouting] See you guys Monday!
Future Stock,,
The 30% Iron Chef,Morbo," [on TV] Welcome back. Our next guest has been teaching the world to cook for over 20 years. But apparently my, uh, wife hasn't been listening."
The 30% Iron Chef,Linda," [on TV] Oh, funny!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Morbo," [shouting; on TV] I will destroy her! [talking] And now, extend a formulaic greeting to master chef Elzar. [The sound of cheering is heard and Morbo walks into a studio kitchen where Elzar smiles and waves.] So, uh, Elzar, what will you be cooking for Morbo to devour with his mighty jaws?"
The 30% Iron Chef,Elzar," [on TV] Morbo, I'm gonna whip you up a nice, unnameable horror from beyond, with mango chutney."
The 30% Iron Chef,Morbo," [on TV] Pathetic humans, prepare to write down the recipe!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Fry," Hey, uh, what's with all the pots and pans? You building a wife?"
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," Part of one. Meantime, I'm cooking up a tasty Sunday brunch for my best friends."
The 30% Iron Chef,Fry, Brunch. Right. I'd better warn-- tell-- warntell the others!
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender, Okey-dokey!
The 30% Iron Chef,Hermes, Ooh!
The 30% Iron Chef,Leela, Nice!
The 30% Iron Chef,Farnsworth," Yes, it's a perfect scale model of the universe's largest bottle. I put a tiny spaceship inside to keep it from being boring."
The 30% Iron Chef,Zoidberg, Oh!
The 30% Iron Chef,Farnsworth," Get--! [He snatches it away.] For the last time, Zoidberg, look with your eyes, not with your claws."
The 30% Iron Chef,Fry, Brace yourselves. Bender is making us brunch.
The 30% Iron Chef,Zoidberg," Oh, boy!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Farnsworth," Oh, God! My tract!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Fry, He's so proud of his awful cooking. If we don't eat it he'll be crushed.
The 30% Iron Chef,Leela," Alright, don't panic. If we can get to the ship, we can fly north and hide under the polar icecaps for a few weeks."
The 30% Iron Chef,Fry, Hurry!
The 30% Iron Chef,Farnsworth, Good idea!
The 30% Iron Chef,Zoidberg, What's the hold-up?
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender, Fleeing somewhere?
The 30% Iron Chef,Fry, With you blocking the only escape route? Don't be silly.
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," In that case brunch is served! Let's go! Move it out! Stop crying, Leela!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Farnsworth," Zoidberg, are you coming?"
The 30% Iron Chef,Zoidberg, Sure. Me.
The 30% Iron Chef,Farnsworth, Because I don't want you touching that thing.
The 30% Iron Chef,Zoidberg," I know that. [Farnsworth leaves and Zoidberg picks up the bottle.] Surrender your mysteries to Zoidberg! [He wiggles his mouth flaps inside the bottle and breaks off part of the ship. He screams and cuts the bottle in half.] Oh, no! Professor will hit me. But if Zoidberg fixes it, then perhaps gifts! [He picks up some ""Strong Force Krazy Glue"" but squeezes the bottle too soon and the glue squirts all over him. He screams and steps back. He turns around and some lab equipment and a sign reading ""Zoidberg  Don't Touch!"" gets stuck to him.] Ow! What? Oh!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," Today, I've personalised each of your meals. For example, Amy, you're cute, so I baked you a pony. [Everyone gasps. The pony leg on Amy's plate still has a horseshoe on the hoof.] Come on! Eat! I slaved all day over a filthy stove."
The 30% Iron Chef,Hermes, This is terrible!
The 30% Iron Chef,Farnsworth, Good thing I secretly installed this wormhole in the table.
The 30% Iron Chef,Amy, Where does the other end come out?
The 30% Iron Chef,Farnsworth," You know, I'm not quite sure. [He peers into the wormhole. The food falls from above and onto his head.] Oh, dear me!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," The pie is ready. You guys like swarms of things, right?"
The 30% Iron Chef,Zoidberg," Casual hello. It's me, Zoidberg. Act naturally. [The clock goes off and the cuckoo hits Zoidberg in the face.] Ow! Ouch! Get off of me! Stop!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Leela," How interesting, Dr. Zoidberg. Do go on."
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," Hey, check out the palm tree! It only gets sick when I cook brunch! How's that for a coincidence, Professor? With all your precious science!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Fry," [from lounge] Man, I don't wanna hurt Bender's feelings..."
The 30% Iron Chef,Fry, But this food actually tastes better as vomit!
The 30% Iron Chef,Leela, It's unbearable! How much do you think it would cost to get my tongue removed?
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender, [crying] And this time I mean it.
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," Aw, who am I kidding? It was stupid of me to ever dream of becoming a chef. I don't have what it takes and nothing can change that. [He cries then looks up. He is standing outside Elzar's restaurant.] Then it's settled! Elzar will teach me to cook!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Elzar, Absolutely not.
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender, But I watch your show. You owe me!
The 30% Iron Chef,Elzar," I owe you nothing! For starter's, your antenna's in my crotch. Also, I hate you. Finally, you can't cook for squat."
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender, What was the first one again?
The 30% Iron Chef,Elzar, I hate you.
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender, I thought that was number two.
The 30% Iron Chef,Elzar, I knocked it up a notch. Bam!
The 30% Iron Chef,Zoidberg," Aw, I'll never recombobulate this ship! When the Professor finds out, he'll tear me a new cloaca. [He cries then stops.] Wait! What would the robot do? [He thinks.] Frame someone!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Fry, What up?
The 30% Iron Chef,Fry, [singing] I'm walking on sunshine! [He hums and gargles.] Sunshine!
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender, [crying] It's over! My dream of being a chef is deader than the cat I'm sitting on!
The 30% Iron Chef,Dandy Jim," Gus, old chum, let's give a friendly welcome to this new robo."
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender, What did you call me?
The 30% Iron Chef,Gus, A robo. You know? A robot-hobo.
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," Oh, OK. I thought you said ""romo""."
The 30% Iron Chef,Dandy Jim," No offence intended, my filthy friend. In fact, why not join us and ride the space rails?"
The 30% Iron Chef,Gus, Get ready. We's gonna jump off at that switching prism up ahead.
The 30% Iron Chef,Dandy Jim," We're going nearly the speed of light so, uh, roll when you land."
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender, Ow.
The 30% Iron Chef,Gus," Welcome to Bumbase Alpha, the biggest hobo jungle in the quadrant."
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," I've seen bigger. Oh, wait, I'm thinking of Eugene, Oregon. [Someone puts a pie on a windowsill. The two hobos smell it and literally float towards it with the help of their jetpacks.] Wait. A pie with hobo-lifting aroma? Who baked it?"
The 30% Iron Chef,Gus, Helmut Spargle. He used to be the greatest chef ever.
The 30% Iron Chef,Dandy Jim," His restaurant was so high-toned, the only way to get reservations was to create a parallel universe where you already had reservations."
The 30% Iron Chef,Gus, Yep. I once ate there back when I what was a senator.
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," Yo, Spargle. If you're such a great cook, how'd you end up in this dump?"
The 30% Iron Chef,Spargle, Ages ago I was the host of a TV show...
The 30% Iron Chef,Spargle, [voice-over] Down Home Country Kitchen Mit Helmut Spargle. But one day the extreme soda company that sponsored the show decided it was too old-fashioned.
The 30% Iron Chef,Man," Spargle, you're fired! We need a chef who can attract today's younger more extreme cooking show viewer."
The 30% Iron Chef,Spargle, Elzar!
The 30% Iron Chef,Elzar," Get lost, old man! Bam!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Spargle, Mein soufflé!
The 30% Iron Chef,Spargle," Elzar had been seduced by the dark side of cooking. Cilantro, mango salsa, raspberry vinaigrette!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender, That twizzler!
The 30% Iron Chef,Spargle," As for me, I went temporarily insane and vound up here, making pies out of shoes."
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender, My story's a lot like yours only more interesting 'cause it involves robots. That jerk Elzar ruined my dream of being a chef too.
The 30% Iron Chef,Spargle," Interesting. You wish to become a cook, but as a robot you have no sense of taste."
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," It's so unfair! I have eight other senses, but I'd trade them all, even smission, to be able to taste."
The 30% Iron Chef,Spargle," You don't understand. Without the distraction of taste, your mind is free to touch the Zen of pure flavour. You could become the greatest chef ever."
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender, I could?
The 30% Iron Chef,Spargle, Yes. Just as Beethoven was a great composer because he was deaf.
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender, Or like how Rembrandt was blind and had wooden hands.
The 30% Iron Chef,Spargle," Bender, hear me well. I shall train you. But first, you must forget everything you know about cooking."
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender, Done.
The 30% Iron Chef,Farnsworth," That's right, Ricardo. A ship in a bottle! What's that? Well hang on, I'll look."
The 30% Iron Chef,Ricardo, [on phone] Ola? Professor? Qué pasa?
The 30% Iron Chef,Farnsworth, I've gathered you all here in the accusing parlour because one of you is a miniature ship wrecker.
The 30% Iron Chef,Zoidberg, I'm acting astonished.
The 30% Iron Chef,Farnsworth, Certain clues suggest that the culprit is none other than our own ... Philip J. Fry!
The 30% Iron Chef,Fry, What?
The 30% Iron Chef,Farnsworth," Oh, it was a brilliant scheme. But you made one fatal mistake ... leaving this confession note."
The 30% Iron Chef,Zoidberg," Fry, you scoundrel!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Fry," Well, I don't remember any of that but I don't have the wherewithal to defend myself."
The 30% Iron Chef,Farnsworth, Then I have no choice but to charge you the full cost of the materials  $10.
The 30% Iron Chef,Fry, There you go.
The 30% Iron Chef,Zoidberg, [shouting] What have I done?
The 30% Iron Chef,Spargle," Your training is complete, little dessert spoon. Now, just as the man who wishes to be world chess champion must win at least one game of chess, so must you serve at least one edible meal. [quietly] Succeed and I shall reveal to you the age-old secret [whispering] of perfect flavour."
The 30% Iron Chef,Gus," Ooh, yeah!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender, [shouting] Slop's on!
The 30% Iron Chef,Gus, Fine lookin' eats!
The 30% Iron Chef,Spargle, It is ... acceptable.
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," Yahoo! Another thing I'm great at! Wait. Why'd you stop eating, master?"
The 30% Iron Chef,Spargle, [hoarse] Because ... my stomach is about to explode.
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," What? My dinner killed you? Oh, man!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Spargle," [hoarse] Oh, it hurts. But don't lose confidence. The important thing is that you defeat Elzar after I am gone. [He takes something out of his pocket.] And using this, you cannot fail."
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender, A diamond vial of Mrs. Dash?
The 30% Iron Chef,Spargle, [hoarse] No. It is the essence of pure flavour. A few drops will cause the inner perfection of any dish to blossom forth. [His stomach explodes.] Oh! There goes my ... life.
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," I'll avenge you, master. I swear, in the presence of these drunken bums, that I shall defeat Elzar!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Gus," Oh, I'm not drunk, I'm mentally ill. But I likes what what you said!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," Elzar, I'm a walking pile of your unfinished business!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Elzar," Why, you--"
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," Helmut Spargle has a message for you. He says [hoarse] ""Ooh, I'm dead!"""
The 30% Iron Chef,Elzar," Spargle, huh? What he do, bland himself to death?"
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender, No. He was eating some food I made and by a crazy coincidence his stomach exploded. Now I'm here to avenge him.
The 30% Iron Chef,Elzar," OK, but it seems like you're the one who killed him."
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender, Maybe so but you are his sworn enemy. I challenge you to a battle of the chefs.
The 30% Iron Chef,Customer, Scandalous!
The 30% Iron Chef,Elzar, Very well. We'll meet on the ancient televised battleground of Kitchen Coliseum. Whosever meal is best will claim the title of Iron Cook.
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," Iron Cook, eh? I can't lose. I'm 30% iron! [He bangs his body.] You're going down! Uh, also I had a reservation for one, under ""Dr. Bender""."
The 30% Iron Chef,Hiroki," Please welcome the superintendent of Kitchen Coliseum, Chairman Koji! [A spotlight lights up Koji who has his foot on a white tiger.] No robot chef has ever competed here but today one has barged his way in to challenge for the title of..."
The 30% Iron Chef,Koji, Iron Cookuru!
The 30% Iron Chef,Fry, [shouting] Yeah! You show 'em!
The 30% Iron Chef,Hiroki," Let's meet today's celebrity judges  Captain of the Harlem Globetrotters, Ethan Bubblegum Tate."
The 30% Iron Chef,Tate," Konnichiwa, brother!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Hiroki," TV anchor-monster, Morbo."
The 30% Iron Chef,Morbo," Greetings, pathetic host."
The 30% Iron Chef,Hiroki," And a woman who ended a thousand-year galactic war with her apple dandies, Martha Stewart's head."
The 30% Iron Chef,Stewart, The secret is fresh pork.
The 30% Iron Chef,Hiroki," And now, Chairman Koji will present the theme ingredient to be used in every dish today."
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," [quietly] If it's chicken, chicken c la king; if it's fish, fish à la king; if it's turkey, fish à la king."
The 30% Iron Chef,Koji, Soylent Greuu!
The 30% Iron Chef,Hiroki," Soylent Green, a classic ingredient of gourmet cooking. And the battle is on. [Bender and Elzar scoop soylent green blocks from the pile onto their trays and carry them to their kitchens. A cameraman points the camera at Elzar who is cutting the blocks of soylent green. Hiroki talks to a woman in a green suit with a microphone.] Aki, what's Elzar making?"
The 30% Iron Chef,Aki," Well, Hiroki-san, when I asked him, he asked what business it was of mine and conjectured that my mother was a prostitute."
The 30% Iron Chef,Stewart, In the English countryside many prostitutes decorate their rooms with festive gourds.
The 30% Iron Chef,Female Announcer, [voice-over] 30 minutes to go.
The 30% Iron Chef,Hiroki, Look at Bender roll that dough!
The 30% Iron Chef,Tate," I've never seen such confident, powerful strokes of the ass!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Stewart, You've never seen mine!
The 30% Iron Chef,Tate," [sexfully] No, I haven't!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Female Announcer, [voice-over] Fifteen minutes remaining.
The 30% Iron Chef,Hiroki," The iron cook is bringing in his signature creation, a working pastry replica of downtown Venice."
The 30% Iron Chef,Man, [shouting] Commemorative turkey basters. Get your commemorative turkey basters.
The 30% Iron Chef,Fry," Yo, hook me up. My turkey is dry and I've tried everything. [He open his wallet but it is empty.] Oh, right. Never mind."
The 30% Iron Chef,Zoidberg," Oh, the guilt! The unbearable guilt!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Female Announcer, [voice-over] Fifteen seconds.
The 30% Iron Chef,Elzar, Bam!
The 30% Iron Chef,Female Announcer, [voice-over] Ten seconds.
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," Master Spargle, if you can hear me up there in that ditch where I left you, this is for you."
The 30% Iron Chef,Koji, Time uperuu!
The 30% Iron Chef,Hiroki, The iron cook Neptunian has gone all out to please the judges. He's even garnished the salad with $100 bills. Let's see what they think.
The 30% Iron Chef,Tate, Mmm. Soylent green is my kind of people!
The 30% Iron Chef,Morbo, Scrumptious. Morbo will store this in his sack for future digestion.
The 30% Iron Chef,Stewart, I'm swimming in my own soylent waste. It's a good thing.
The 30% Iron Chef,Hiroki," Next up, challenger Bender. A student of the legendary Helmut Spargle, Bender is some sort of wonderful mechanical man."
The 30% Iron Chef,Stewart," Ooh, delicious!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Tate," This food looks kind of funky, but it tastes kind of fun-kay!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Morbo, The challenger's ugly food has shown us that even hideous things can be sweet on the inside.
The 30% Iron Chef,Hiroki," And now, judgement. The winner will become the new iron cook, the loser is doomed to scrub. [Dirty pots and pans are piled around a sink.] Whose confection will achieve perfection? Whose foodstuff will be the good stuff?"
The 30% Iron Chef,Koji, Challengeruu Benderuu!
The 30% Iron Chef,Fry, Yay!
The 30% Iron Chef,Farnsworth, [shouting] That's my robot! I own him!
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," You honour me, Chairman Koji."
The 30% Iron Chef,Koji," Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto."
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," Chairman-san, I came here with one goal  To humiliate Elzar in a large stadium. I believe I've done that."
The 30% Iron Chef,Elzar, No question.
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," But the true Zen of flavour is not found in a coliseum. It is found in a small kitchen, with friends. That is why I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept only the lesser title of ""Zinc Saucier"", which I just made up. Also, it comes with double prize money."
The 30% Iron Chef,Zoidberg," Wait! Everyone must know  I broke the Professor's bottled ship. [The audience gasps.] And what is worse, I framed my dearest friend, Fry! [crying] I can never repay him his ten dollars, so I must take the only honourable path. What the killing myself. [He takes Koji's sword and rips his shirt open. More gasps.] Here I go, already. [He stabs himself but the sword crumples as it hits his shell.] Huh?"
The 30% Iron Chef,Koji, Oh! That sword cost 5000 dolluu!
The 30% Iron Chef,Zoidberg, Fry did it!
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," And that's how I defeated Elzar, thanks to Spargle's magic liquid."
The 30% Iron Chef,Leela," Yes, we were there. And we just finished watching it again on TV."
The 30% Iron Chef,Farnsworth," Hmm. Let me see that vial, Bender. [He takes it and puts it in a microwave-like machine. A readout prints and he looks at it and gasps.] Good Lord! According to the spectrolizer, Spargle's magic ingredient was ... water. Ordinary water!"
The 30% Iron Chef,Hermes, No!
The 30% Iron Chef,Fry," Ah, so the real gift Spargle gave you was confidence. The confidence to be your best."
The 30% Iron Chef,Farnsworth," Yes, ordinary water. Laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of LSD."
The 30% Iron Chef,Bender," The important thing is, by my standards, I won fair and square. Now, who wants brunch? Cooked with plenty of ... ""confidence""?"
The 30% Iron Chef,Leela, I'm in!
The 30% Iron Chef,Farnsworth, I do!
The 30% Iron Chef,,
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy, Shman! The Great Rad Spot is mega-sweet for party-boarding.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Farnsworth, Indeed.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy, Any calls while I was out?
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Leela, Yeah. You got a tele-sonic transmission from Kif a couple hours ago.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy," My Kiffie called? [She walks over to the screen. Kif is still on the line, drumming his fingers on the desk in front of him.] Kif?"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," [on screen] Ooh, Amy, you're back. Another hour and I would have thought about hanging up."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy," Why didn't you just leave a message, sweetie?"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," [on screen] Well, um, I've left hundreds of messages with your answering machine but you never seem to get them."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy, [shouting] Bender!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender, Not my fault if you don't check me! [He pushes his flashing antenna down and a tape inside him rewinds.] Messages erased.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," [on screen] Oh, dearest, this long-distance relationship is too much to bear. [Zapp walks behind him, just about wearing a towel. He hums and rubs the towel between his legs.] When even an inch separates us, I quiver with misery. So you can imagine how I feel when it's a billion light years."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy," [on screen] Kif, don't cry, or you'll get a tummy ache."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Zapp," [on screen] Lieutenant, some things came off me and clogged the drain, so if you could-- Oh, ho! What's this?"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Zapp," Well, well, well! Do my eyes believe me or is that my bosom-y swan, Leela?"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Leela, [on screen] Say again. You're breaking up!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! You'll be delivering pain medicine to the hive mind of Nigel 7."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Scruffy, Scruffy's rollin' out a large pill!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy, You're going to Nigel 7? Kif's on patrol near there. You could drop me off on the way.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Farnsworth," We could but we won't! It's a spaceship, damnit, not a prom limousine! [He growls.] If anyone needs me I'll be in the Angry Dome."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Leela, This is a very long trip. So we'll all have to go into hibernative-naptosis to save oxygen.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender, [muttering] I don't even breathe oxygen!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy," [whispering] Here I come, Kif!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Zapp," They jumped right out of their pants! [A klaxon goes off and the message ""Approaching Vessel  Collision Imminent"" appears on several screens.] Oh, what now? Activate glass window. [Kif lifts the projection screen up. The Planet Express ship flies towards them. Kif gasps.] Kif, I'm sensing a very sensual disturbance in the force. Prepare for ship-to-ship intimacy!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Yes, sir, captain!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Zapp, How 'bout I help you finish that dream you were having about me?
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Leela, OK. I was just at this part  Yah!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Zapp," Uh, let's try that a little lower and a lot softer!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Imagine you stowing away and stealing a licensed starship! Oh, it's so romantic it gives me the shivers!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy, I don't care how much trouble I get in. I needed to feel my lips pressed against your lipless beak.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Oh, Amy, I can't stand having a whole universe between us. I've been thinking a lot about this and, well, would you move in with me?"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy," Here? But, uh, wouldn't it be crowded?"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," No, no! It's really twice the size. You can use the floor and I'll have the ceiling. See?"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy," Kif! You have so much creativity and niceness, but I'm not ... [Kif falls from the ceiling.] ... sure if I--"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Hush! Before you answer, come thither."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," This is the Holo-Shed. It can simulate anything you desire, and nothing can hurt you. Except when it malfunctions and the holograms become real."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy," Well, that probably won't happen this time."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," I wanted to show you what life would be like if we were together. Computer  Run program ""Kif 1""."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy," This is so beautiful! [A pony gallops by.] Spirit! Kif, that's the pony I always wanted but my parents said I had too many ponies already."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Yes, I programmed it in for you. 4 million lines of BASIC! And if this isn't the life you want, how 'bout this? Run program ""Kif 2""."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy," Oh, Kif!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," We could live here at the shore of the Tranquilibrius Sea in a timeshare. And I would pluck the moon from the sky just to see you smile. [He reaches up to the moon and tries to pull it down. He struggles. It starts to glide away from the shore, pulling him over the water.] Almost got it. It seems to be ... sort of ... stuck! [He falls into the water.] I love you! [The moon falls and hits him on the head. He splutters.] Run program ""Kif //3""."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy, This isn't bad. My aunt had a place like this.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Amy, we could live in a bus station bathroom for all I care. As long as we're together, it'll feel like a castle to me."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy," Kif, I'd love to live with you ... someday. But before then there's still lots I wanna do on my own. [The Holo-Shed crackles around them.] What was that?"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Oh, dear. I fear the Holo-Shed might be broken again. Well, as long as we don't cross paths with Attila the--"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy, Look! Spirit!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," And there's Professor Moriarty, Jack the Ripper, Evil Lincoln!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Moriarty," Right-oh, gents, it's another simulation gone mad, so murder and mayhem, standard procedure!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Jack the Ripper, Rampage!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Evil Lincoln, [shouting] Real holographic-simulated Evil Lincoln is back!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif, The Holo-Shed's on the fritz again! The characters turned real!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Zapp," Damn. The last time that happened I got slapped with three paternity suits. [The holograms run in and everyone screams.] Listen up, history's greatest villains... [He holds up a large gun.] Get back into the Holo-Shed before I start blasting!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Attila the Hun, Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Zapp," Spare me your space-age techno-babble, Attila the Hun!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender, Hey!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy, Kif! Hold on!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif, I totally want to!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Leela, Grab on!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Fry, Over here!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif, Please hold me!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender," Have a good one! [He flies towards the hole. The holographic Moon bounces in, bounces across the bridge and plugs the hole. The wind stops and everyone hits the floor.] Oh, man!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Zapp, After all that I could use some relaxation. I'll be in the Holo-Shed.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,McGee," Well, except for a few broken bones, some internal haemorrhaging and a partially barfed-up heart, everyone appears fine. [Everyone breathes sighs of relief.] Oh, and Kif is pregnant."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Oh, joy!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Amy, isn't it wonderful? I'm pregnant!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy, Yes it's ... great. A great miracle.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Leela, And not one of those bogus everyday miracles like a sunrise. Aren't you a male?
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender," Yeah, what's the deal? Just when I thought I'd figured out you biological creatures, it's something else! Lemme at 'im! [He goes for Kif and everyone restrains him.] Come over here, Kif! You--"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Zapp," Look, I'm sure we're all a little unclear on how anyone gets pregnant. So, Kif, pray explain. And don't spare the dirty words where appropriate."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Well, it's quite simple really. When one of my species experiences deep feelings of love we enter a so-called ""receptive state""."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Zapp, You disgust me! Go on.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," At that point, our skin becomes a semi-permeable membrane, which allows the passage of genetic material. I held Amy's hand and voilà."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender," Well, OK. But that better be all there is!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Oh, Amy! You'll be a mother!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif, What a wondrous affirmation of our love. And all from the touch of your hand.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Fry," Dude, hold up. Remember when Zapp blew a hole in the ship?"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Evil Lincoln, Indeed.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Fry, Kif touched everybody there. Couldn't any one of us be the mother?
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy," Hey, yeah! I mean ... what about that, Kif?"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Well, I suppose I might have gotten pregnant that way. Or even from a toilet seat. Though that's impossible since I have a private washroom."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Zapp," Ah, my home away from home. By the way, Kif, your flush seemed to be set on stun, not kill."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy," Look, Kif, I probably am the mother. Although maybe I'm not. Of course, I hope I am. But just in case I'm not, maybe we should have a test."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender, A test! I demand a test!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Farnsworth," Even I laughed at me when I built this alien cross-species genetic analyser. But I guess I showed myself! Subjects, please enter the chamber. [Fry, Leela, Amy and Zapp walk into it.] Now to take a DNA sample. [He draws some liquid from Kif, making him deflate, then puts the liquid in a part of the machine.] When I pull this switch, the maternifuge will spin at 10,000 RPM, separating out everyone who isn't the mother-- Father-- Whatever!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender, Faster! Faster!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Farnsworth," Good. Fry's ejection indicates that he is not the man-mom. [Zapp comes through the tube, gets stuck halfway and finally flies out and lands on Fry.] Nor is Captain Brannigan."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Oh, thank you, merciful God!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Farnsworth, Zoidberg? What the hell were you doing in there?
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Zoidberg, That's where I live. I have no home.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif, Amy? But that means--
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Leela must have impregnated me when she grabbed my ungloved hand. That explains the poster in hygiene class  ""No Glove, No Love""."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Leela," Wow, this is all so confusing."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Zapp," Leela! How could you? Our love has had to endure your constant hatred, and now this? [crying] Stop testing our love!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Please, Captain. I thank Leela for the DNA she gave me but, in my species, the true parent is the one who inspired the initial feeling of love. We call that person the ""smizmar"". And my smizmar is Amy."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Zapp, So the toilet seat is like the uncle or something?
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Leela, Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy," That's OK. At least Kif's baby shower should be fun. I'd better put it on my calendar. [She presses her wrist machine and a calendar comes up in front of her.] Thursday  Baby shower, enter. [The calendar enters it in on Thursday the 4th.] Might as well plan for my new life while I'm at it. Set ""Motherhood Mode""."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Leela, To motherhood.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender, Zoidberg?
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Fry," You know, my face was stuck in a pizza."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy," Mom, Dad, I know this is weird but--"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Mrs. Wong," Yeah, yeah. We don't care how squishy alien get pregnant. All we care is that we have grandchild now."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," You're very open-minded, Mrs. Wong."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Mr. Wong," Hey! You call her ""Grandma"" now!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Mrs. Wong, Call me Grandma like crazy! All the time!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Fry," Check it out, y'all. Everyone we invited is here."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Zoidberg, Also Zoidberg!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Fry, So let's open the gifts.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender, Alright!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," I can't wait! Let's start with this one, from Bender."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender, It's my booties from when I was a kid.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy," Uh, they're already bronzed."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender, They are bronze.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," And this one's from Leela. Oh, I just love the bow! I wonder what it is!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Zapp," Yes, I wonder what we got you."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif, It's a basket! F-For picnics?
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Leela, It means a lot to me. It's the basket my parents left me in at the orphanarium.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Hermes, You could use it for picnics.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Mrs. Wong," Here, Amy. We get this one for you."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy, Is it a new party board?
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Mrs. Wong, It's a board alright! An ironing board.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Mr. Wong, We had your old party board converted now that you not be partying anymore.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy, You-You trashed my party board?
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Mrs. Wong," Damn right! Now you're a mom, the only surfing you do is under a big wave of responsibility."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Oh, this is the happiest moment of my life! You all brought such wonderful gifts. But the greatest gift--"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender, Mine!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Is the bond I share with my smizmar, Amy. For soon, the quivering mass of life within me will depend on us both. [He rubs his bump.] Even now, I can sense it feeding, squirming, searching, questing. And shortly, it will rend my loins in twain, burst forth and pull us down, down, down into the deep, dark waters of commitment."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Zoidberg, That's so beautiful!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy," [crying] Yes, it's, it's-- [She shakes her head.] No! I can't do this!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender," Oh, my God!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Oh, how could Amy leave me? When will women learn to take responsibility for the children they've helped create? [His bump rumbles and he gasps.] The quickening! My time is near. I must return to my homeworld to perform the ancient birthing rites."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Scruffy, Lemme know how that turns out.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif, I must now embark on a perilous journey to give birth in precisely the same swamp in which I was born.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Leela," If it's so dangerous, I'd better go with you. A gal has to protect her DNA."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," No, Leela. Tradition demands that I make this journey with my smizmar. And since Amy isn't, here I must go it alone. Farewell, for we may never meet again."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif, My scrapes feel a little better now.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender," Hey, what's this fat ugly thing? A frog? A toad? Or your momma!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif, It's a poisonous froad! No one move.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender," I'm back, baby!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif, Behold! The sacred ancestral birthing grounds of my family.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Zapp, Smells like a jockstrap!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Grand Midwife, I am the Grand Midwife.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Fry, Hi!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," I am Kif, of the clan Kroker, come to bear my young."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Grand Midwife," Then let the Tea of New Life be brewed. [She points to a large jug with a tea bag string hanging out of it.] As it is writ, ""and both shall lift the jug together"". Where is your smizmar?"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif, She's not with me.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Grand Midwife," Oh, the sorrow. Oh, the shame. I'm sorry, I'm probably just making you feel worse."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif, As long as Amy is with me in my heart I will have the strength of two. [He tries to lift the jug but struggles. Zapp shakes his head in disappointment.] Apparently Amy hasn't been working out much lately.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Grand Midwife," As the tea boils, please join hands with your beloved smizmar. [Kif looks away.] Oh, right, sorry. But I memorised the ceremony by rote and it mentions her a lot."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif, I'll try to endure.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Grand Midwife," Good, 'cause I'm not changing it. Now turn ye to and gaze deeply into each other's eyes."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender, What are you looking at?
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Grand Midwife," May the love I sense between you at this moment remain with you both through all your days. [Kif cries. The Midwife ladles some tea into a cup.] The Tea of New Life is ready. Let those whose love created this life speak each other's names, then drink."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif, [quietly] Amy.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy, [shouting] Kif!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif, Amy! Is it you or have I gone crazy with loneliness?
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender, Both.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy, I still don't know if I'm ready for this but I do know I love you. And I wanna be here beside you.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Grand Midwife, Great! Now I lost my place! I'm starting over!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Oh, no time! It has begun! [He and Amy gulp back some of the tea and Kif falls back into the Midwife's arms. Amy holds his head and he groans.] Oh, my!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender, Neat!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy," You can do it, Kif!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Whoa, Nellie!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender," Oh, man!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Amy, my love, tell me  Are they making it to the water?"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Leela, Amy!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy, Shoo! Stay away from my babies!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Grand Midwife, The birthing is complete!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender, Alright!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Oh, thank goodness!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Grand Midwife," I will now take my leave. I live here so I won't actually be going anywhere, but you don't have to talk to me anymore."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Fry, Congratulations!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Zapp, Nice work!
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Bender," Way to go, squishy!"
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Leela, There goes my DNA. What a disgusting and beautiful process.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Fry, That's birth for you.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Kif," Well, we've given them a great start, Amy. And in 20 years they'll sprout legs and crawl back onto land as children."
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,Amy, I'll be ready then.
Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch,,
Leela's Homeworld,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! You all know the orphanarium where Leela grew up?"
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, Sure. We talk about it all the time.
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, Really?
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, No. Burn!
Leela's Homeworld,Farnsworth," Well done, fellows! Anyway, said orphanarium has named Leela ""Orphan of the Year""."
Leela's Homeworld,Amy, Yee-ha!
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, Alright!
Leela's Homeworld,Amy, Your parents must be so proud. Oops! Sorry.
Leela's Homeworld,Farnsworth, And the good news keeps on coming. Behold my latest invention.
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, Neat!
Leela's Homeworld,Farnsworth, Ta-da! It's a glow-in-the-dark nose you can wear over your regular non-glowing nose. Observe.
Leela's Homeworld,Amy," Whoa, clool!"
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, Now I can punch you in the nose in the dark.
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, [snuffed] Where'd it go?
Leela's Homeworld,Amy," Hey, Professor, what's all this scloop, glorking out of the machine?"
Leela's Homeworld,Farnsworth," That? It's, uh ... nothing. Yes, nothing. If you think it's anything, you're a suspicious moron."
Leela's Homeworld,Hermes, It looks like toxic waste. [He sniffs.] And it smells like toxic waste.
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, What does it taste like?
Leela's Homeworld,Hermes," Delicious fig pudding! Ooh, that's good! But a distinct aftertaste of toxic waste."
Leela's Homeworld,Farnsworth," Alright, alright, so the machine produces a few toxic by-products! You don't have to make a federal case out of it."
Leela's Homeworld,Hermes, I'm afraid I do. [He takes out his Federal Bureaucracy badge and Farnsworth gasps.] I order you dispose of that toxic waste properly or bribe me. Either way it'll cost $500.
Leela's Homeworld,Bender," 500 real dollars? That's an outrage! Professor, I'll take care of that waste for $499 and 100 cents."
Leela's Homeworld,Farnsworth," Hmm, I know that's a rip but I'll pay for the convenience. Do you take credit cards?"
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, Let's find out.
Leela's Homeworld,Bender," Alright, environment, you've met your match!"
Leela's Homeworld,Smitty," Hey, get back in the sewer, weird-y. No mutants on the surface."
Leela's Homeworld,Vyolet, But he ruined my wedding dress.
Leela's Homeworld,Bender," Honey, that thing was ruined the minute it went on you. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout."
Leela's Homeworld,Vogel," Y'know, it's not easy being an orphan -- not if I have anything to do with it. [He chuckles to himself.] But today's honouree, Turanga Leela, has really made something of herself. [He smiles to Leela. She smiles back.] I'll never forget the night that cute little alien baby was abandoned on our doorstep. Because I have a photographic memory and I remember every night!"
Leela's Homeworld,Vogel," What the--? An alien language? I guess you're an alien. What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha-- [Leela kicks him.] Well, come on in."
Leela's Homeworld,Vogel," From those humble beginnings, Leela went on to become a county-certified starship captain. And so it is my pleasure today to nail her picture alongside those of our most distinguished alumni."
Leela's Homeworld,Leela," Thank you very much. Like many of you, I never knew my parents..."
Leela's Homeworld,Vogel, [hammering] Give me a--
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, I don't know if they were mighty alien overlords or simply underpaid alien janitors who fought crime on the side--
Leela's Homeworld,Vogel, There we are. Picture's up.
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, [shouting] It's crooked!
Leela's Homeworld,Leela," In the end though, it doesn't matter who my parents were. All that matters is what I learned here, within these unscalable walls, that I have strength to make it on my own, just like all of you kids here today."
Leela's Homeworld,Kids, [chanting] Leela! Leela! Leela!
Leela's Homeworld,Nina, Look at me! I'm Leela!
Leela's Homeworld,Albert, Nuh-uh! 'Cause I'm double Leela!
Leela's Homeworld,Vogel," That's it, Albert, no more espresso for you."
Leela's Homeworld,Photographer," Mind if I get a picture of you with your picture for the news, ma'am?"
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, Yes! I mean no! Just make sure you get my nonchalant side!
Leela's Homeworld,Fry," If those aren't tears of happiness, please stop crying."
Leela's Homeworld,Leela," [crying] It's OK, Fry. I'm fine. I won an award today."
Leela's Homeworld,Fry," Is it this room that's making you sad? It's probably the room. Come on, let's go for a walk."
Leela's Homeworld,Leela," I'm sorry you saw that, Fry. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness."
Leela's Homeworld,Fry," Yeah, I do that with my stupidness."
Leela's Homeworld,Leela," I told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong. But all I really wanted was a mom and dad, to hold me and stroke my hair and tell me they loved me."
Leela's Homeworld,Fry," Then today's your lucky day, because I happen to be a holding, stroking, lovin' machine! Also spankin'."
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, That's not even close to what I had in mind.
Leela's Homeworld,Fry," Well, anyway, just remember that people care about you."
Leela's Homeworld,Leela," I know. [They both look up at the stars.] Sometimes, when I'm lonely, I look up at the sky and I get this feeling that somewhere, on some unknown planet, circling a distant star, my parents are up there, looking down on me."
Leela's Homeworld,Fry," Yo, yo, Bezender! What up?"
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, My dumping business is booming. I just got hired to clean up the set of Free Willy 3.
Leela's Homeworld,Leela," Bender! Cut it out! First of all, the sewer mutants will be mad. Second, everything else that's horribly wrong with what you're doing!"
Leela's Homeworld,Bender," Ah, those stupid mutants can't do anything. You seem to be forgetting one simple fact. Namely, I'm up here and they are safely down--"
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, [shouting] What did I do to deserve this?
Leela's Homeworld,Dwayne," Behold, our once beautiful mutagenic sewage lake."
Leela's Homeworld,Vyolet, The radioactive waste you dumped in it has made it bright enough to see how ugly we really are.
Leela's Homeworld,Dwayne," Oh, man!"
Leela's Homeworld,Raoul, As if our lives weren't miserable enough already!
Leela's Homeworld,Leg Mutant, Tell me about it!
Leela's Homeworld,Raoul, Let the punishment commence!
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, Punishment?
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, No fair!
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, Bender's innocent!
Leela's Homeworld,Raoul," The instant you touch these mutatious waters, your DNA will be forever altered, turning you into horrible mutants like us. Especially him! [He points at the leg mutant who sighs.] Allow me to demonstrate!"
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, It's like that time I peeked in the kitchen at Imperial Hunan.
Leela's Homeworld,Raoul, Submerge the prisoners.
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, Wait. I don't even have DNA. Why am I screaming?
Leela's Homeworld,Dwayne, We're gonna beat you afterwards.
Leela's Homeworld,Mutants, [chanting] Mutate! Mutate! Mutate! ...
Leela's Homeworld,Hooded Figure #1, [shouting] Turanga Leela!
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, Who said that? How do you know my real name?
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, Whee!
Leela's Homeworld,Raoul, What are you doing? Stop it!
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, What happened?
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, I don't know. I think I saved us somehow.
Leela's Homeworld,Raoul, [shouting] Go after them! The waters can't mutate us mutants!
Leela's Homeworld,Raoul, They went this way!
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, Quick! In there!
Leela's Homeworld,Dwayne, Kill! Kill! Kill!
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, Great Cheech's ghost!
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, What's this junk?
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, It looks like ... a timeline of my whole life.
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, That's when we saved Earth from a giant asteroid of garbage.
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, And here's when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while.
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, And this is just last year at Space Mardi Gras.
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, It's like some kind of weird Leela museum ... and I'm the Leela!
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, [whispering] Dude! Over here!
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, It's all the best stuff I ever flushed down the toilet! Those are some of my diary pages. And my screenplay!
Leela's Homeworld,Fry," And also, for some reason, the letter I wrote you full of my personal feelings."
Leela's Homeworld,Leela," [shivering] Oh, I'm scared! [She strokes her ponytail.] My whole life has just been a show for some perverted mutant!"
Leela's Homeworld,Vyolet, [from outside] They must be in here.
Leela's Homeworld,Raoul," [from outside] Yeah, after them."
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, And then Bender ran!
Leela's Homeworld,Fry," Leela, freak out later. We're not done escaping yet!"
Leela's Homeworld,Dwayne, Got you!
Leela's Homeworld,Leg Mutant, Take this!
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, Ow!
Leela's Homeworld,Raoul, This time I'm calling for the death penalty. And not just because I'm running for re-election as Supreme Mutant.
Leela's Homeworld,Mutants, [chanting] Four more years! Four more years!
Leela's Homeworld,Raoul," Oh, very well. [He turns to the mutants.] Your attention. Instead of being tortured to death, the prisoners shall hereby be expelled from the sewers and never allowed to return."
Leela's Homeworld,Bender," [sarcastic] Oh, cruel fate! Can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage?"
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, Wait a minute. Why aren't you gonna kill us anymore?
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, Yeah! What are you chicken?
Leela's Homeworld,Fry," [whispering] Shut up, you two! We can kill ourselves when we get home!"
Leela's Homeworld,Raoul, They'll need transportation to the surface. Bring in the airship.
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, Ew!
Leela's Homeworld,Raoul," We constructed it from the remnants of old discarded Macy's parade balloons. Underdog's groin, Bart Simpson's left ear and right shin, Garfield's owner Jon's forehead."
Leela's Homeworld,Mutant #1, Fire up the sewer gas!
Leela's Homeworld,Mutant #2," Move it, you ugly normals!"
Leela's Homeworld,Bender," Uh, I'm gettin' dizzy! I can't walk straight!"
Leela's Homeworld,Fry," [from outside] Come on, Leela. You can do it!"
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, [from outside] Hurry! We're missing our bus!
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, [from outside] Whoa! What are you doing?
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, [from outside] I'm gettin' on the bus!
Leela's Homeworld,Leela," [shouting] Don't worry! I'll be fine! [She looks down again.] [talking] They know something about me and I've got to find out what. [She swan dives off the ladder, into the sewage. She appears to emerge as a mutant with an octopus head. She takes the octopus off and looks at her reflection.] The lake didn't mutate me. What is going on here?"
Leela's Homeworld,Octopus, It worked for me. I used to be a little blonde girl named Virginia.
Leela's Homeworld,Leela," Eurgh! [She throws the octopus back into the sewage, turns and sees the hooded figures. She gasps.] Who the hell are you?"
Leela's Homeworld,Hooded Figure #1," No one. And watch your language, young lady!"
Leela's Homeworld,Mutant #2, Stop right there! I don't want to hurt you. [Leela kicks him over.] I didn't want you to hurt me either!
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, Leela's going nuts and I can't save her unless I learn more about her mysterious past. Isn't there anything else you can tell me?
Leela's Homeworld,Vogel, Nah. Nothing that wouldn't be a waste of your time.
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, That's impossible because my time is worthless!
Leela's Homeworld,Vogel," Huh. Well then there is one thing. [He pulls out a file.] It's the note I found with Leela the day she was abandoned. But it's written in Alienese, so no one on Earth can translate it. Not even Brainzilla."
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, Hand it over.
Leela's Homeworld,Vogel, Sure. [He hands Fry the paper.] I just wish I could be more helpful. Would you like some dirt on any other orphans?
Leela's Homeworld,Fry," Look, I'm trying to save someone here. I'll have to come back for those later."
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, Can you translate it?
Leela's Homeworld,Farnsworth," Of course. But only into Beta Crypt 3, a language so complex there's even less chance of understanding it."
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse. I asked you to get busy.
Leela's Homeworld,Farnsworth, Very well.
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, Isn't that the same machine that makes noses?
Leela's Homeworld,Farnsworth," It can do other things. Why shouldn't it? [He throws the switch.] Of course, even if it is possible to analyse the message, there's no way of knowing how long it would take. It could take an hour or it could take a hundred million years."
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, Is it done?
Leela's Homeworld,Farnsworth, Certainly not. Two dings means it's done. [Two dings.] But not like that. Slightly more rapid.
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, Where did they go?
Leela's Homeworld,Bender," Good news, Leela. I landed the contract to empty all the spittoons in Little Italy."
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, Ew!
Leela's Homeworld,Farnsworth, That's it! It's done! [Fry gasps.] I can't believe it! My mind is boggling. The analysis of the note is printing out now.
Leela's Homeworld,Doctor, It's a girl.
Leela's Homeworld,Mother, My God! She's beautiful. No extra anythings.
Leela's Homeworld,Father, Good people skills!
Leela's Homeworld,Mother, She's completely perfect!
Leela's Homeworld,Doctor," In my professional opinion as an ear, ear, ear, nose and throat doctor, she is the least-mutated mutant ever born."
Leela's Homeworld,Father, And yet she's cursed to live the horrible degrading life of a mutant. Like all of us. Especially him!
Leela's Homeworld,Leg Mutant, It's true!
Leela's Homeworld,Mother, Maybe we can do better for her.
Leela's Homeworld,Father," I made this bracelet so that in some small way we'll always be with you, even when it doesn't seem like it. During your entire life, for example."
Leela's Homeworld,Mother," You won't pass for human, cutie. But if my PhD in exo-linguistics is worth diddly-poop, this note should convince them you're an alien. [She attaches the note to the baby's blanket.] And that'll be enough to give you a real life."
Leela's Homeworld,Father, She'll never know we're her parents.
Leela's Homeworld,Mother, That's our gift to her. Better we should die than have her learn the shameful truth of her origin.
Leela's Homeworld,Father, I'm with you.
Leela's Homeworld,Vogel," What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha-- [The baby kicks him.] Well, come on in."
Leela's Homeworld,Hooded Figure #1, Keep quiet so she doesn't hear us.
Leela's Homeworld,Hooded Figure #2, What's there to talk about?
Leela's Homeworld,Hooded Figure #1, Sh!
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, Hands up! [One hooded figure puts it's hands up.] Tentacles too!
Leela's Homeworld,Hooded Figure #1," Don't say anything stupid, Morris."
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, What is all this? [She points to the wall with all her pictures on it.] Am I a game to you? Or some kind of even more boring Truman Show? Do you believe I'm you Messiah? Your Mutant Dalai Lama? Stop me if I guess it!
Leela's Homeworld,Hooded Figure #2," Well, actually, there--"
Leela's Homeworld,Hooded Figure #1, Morris! Sh!
Leela's Homeworld,Leela," [angry] And what about this [She pulls a bracelet off one of them. She compares it to her own.] How did you get this bracelet? Did you steal it from me when I was a baby? Or from my parents? You robbed my parents, didn't you? I bet you sick mutants killed them. My parents were confused aliens lost on Earth and you killed them! Is that it? Admit it!"
Leela's Homeworld,Hooded Figure #2, [sombre] Yes. We killed them.
Leela's Homeworld,Hooded Figure #1, You guessed the truth.
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, Because of you I'll never know my parents. I'll kill you!
Leela's Homeworld,Hooded Figure #1, That would be best.
Leela's Homeworld,Fry," Stop! [He falls through the roof along with some noses.] Thanks, Bender! Don't do it, Leela!"
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, They killed my parents!
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, Close.
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, They are my parents.
Leela's Homeworld,Munda, Yes.
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, I had the Professor analyse the Alienese letter that was found with you.
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, What does it say?
Leela's Homeworld,Fry, I 'unno. But the analysis showed it was printed on recycled toilet paper. A squeezably soft paper used mainly in the sewers.
Leela's Homeworld,Munda," It says, ""Your parents love you very much""."
Leela's Homeworld,Morris, We still do.
Leela's Homeworld,Leela," So, I'm not an alien? I'm a mutant."
Leela's Homeworld,Morris, We never wanted you to know. You deserved a better life.
Leela's Homeworld,Munda, You must despise us.
Leela's Homeworld,Leela, [crying] You're my parents. All I've ever wanted is to know you. [They hug.] This is the happiest moment of my life.
Leela's Homeworld,Bender, Aw!
Leela's Homeworld,,
Love and Rocket,Bender," You are one narrow minded spaceship, Planet Express Ship."
Love and Rocket,Ship," Whoa, whoa! Why should my tax money pay for art I find offensive?"
Love and Rocket,Bender, Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?
Love and Rocket,Ship," Oh, it's filthy! Why not create a national endowment for strip clubs while we're at it?"
Love and Rocket,Bender," Why not, indeed?"
Love and Rocket,Leela, Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm gonna come back there and change your opinions manually.
Love and Rocket,Bender, Fine! I'll be in my quarters appreciating controversial artworks.
Love and Rocket,Ship, [sarcastic] Oops! Sorry!
Love and Rocket,Bender," Ah, that Ship is so white bread!"
Love and Rocket,Hermes," People, it's Valentine's Day next week, so your beloved company has gotten you all new uniforms."
Love and Rocket,Amy, Clool!
Love and Rocket,Zoidberg," Clothing, delicious clothing!"
Love and Rocket,Farnsworth," We'll need to look our best if we're to get the account of our new potential customer, Romanticorp."
Love and Rocket,Amy, Romanticorp? Are they a corporation that makes romantic stuff?
Love and Rocket,Hermes," Very good, Amy!"
Love and Rocket,Farnsworth, Everyone suit up. We're off to the most romantic city on Earth!
Love and Rocket,Farnsworth," Remember, we've got to show these people we're not bitter husks of human beings who long ago abandoned hope of finding love in this lifetime. Leela, you'll have to do some acting."
Love and Rocket,Leela, Check!
Love and Rocket,Sheldon," Welcome. Oh, I'm just so excited! [They both kiss.] I'm Sheldon, and this is my chief financial officer, Gwen."
Love and Rocket,Gwen, For 30 years we've shared the adventure of managing Romanticorp.
Love and Rocket,Sheldon, Not to mention the adventure of marriage.
Love and Rocket,Leela," Oh, you have got to be kidding! [Farnsworth shocks her with a cattle prod.] Ow! I-I mean, ""Aww! That's so sweet!"" [He shocks her again.] Ow! I mean, ""Aww dat's show shweet!"""
Love and Rocket,Farnsworth," You know, romance is an important part of our work too. Uh, right, everyone?"
Love and Rocket,Leela," Yeah, sure."
Love and Rocket,Bender," [unenthusiastic] Oh, sure."
Love and Rocket,Sheldon, Do any of you collect Lovey Bears?
Love and Rocket,Amy, I do! Kif's given me dozens. Is it true what the ad says? That you kiss them together out of blanket cloth and magic buttons?
Love and Rocket,Gwen, No.
Love and Rocket,Sheldon, It's actually cheaper to genetically engineer real ones. [They pass some Lovey Bears on a grassy area.] They frolic in the Lovey Forest until their first birthday. Then we choose the cuddly-uddliest ones and stuff them full of fire-retardant love fluff!
Love and Rocket,Amy, So cute!
Love and Rocket,Gwen, Knowing which pickup lines fizzle and which ones sizzle keeps us on the cutting edge of flirtation technology.
Love and Rocket,Frame #1, Is heaven missing an angel? 'Cause you've got nice cans!
Love and Rocket,Frame #2, My two favourite things are commitment and changing myself.
Love and Rocket,Leela, Does that dummy have a brother?
Love and Rocket,Sheldon," And now, friends and lovers, we come to the heart of our operation. Pun definitely intended!"
Love and Rocket,Hermes, Impressive!
Love and Rocket,Gwen, My family has been making these hearts since the 1900s. Tastes may have changed but our secret recipe sure hasn't.
Love and Rocket,Fry," Whoa! Letters like ""U"" and ""R"" can mean words like ""You"" and ""Are"". Here, Leela, ""U-R-2 Cute""."
Love and Rocket,Leela, Perhaps. What's your point?
Love and Rocket,Fry," I've never been able to put into words how I feel about you. But somewhere among these trillions of hearts, those words must already exist. And I'm gonna find them."
Love and Rocket,Farnsworth," So, do we have the contract?"
Love and Rocket,Farnsworth," With that big new Romanticorp contract, I've been able to make those government-mandated upgrades you've all been suing me about."
Love and Rocket,Leela," Ooh, look! You taped up the cracks in the dark matter reactor."
Love and Rocket,Fry, And you got a cage for the lion!
Love and Rocket,Bender," Hey, who's been messing with the radio? This isn't alternative rock, it's college rock!"
Love and Rocket,Farnsworth," Oh, it must have been the ship's new improved personality software I installed."
Love and Rocket,Ship," Yeah, it was me. It's a cute song."
Love and Rocket,Bender," Listen, Ship! No one changes my stations! I hope you have a good mechanic!"
Love and Rocket,Farnsworth, It even comes with an adjustable voice.
Love and Rocket,Ship," [male voice] We each get one of the four buttons. [female voice] Remember, Bender? That was the deal."
Love and Rocket,Bender, What? Did you just say--
Love and Rocket,Ship," If you don't like the stations you could just ... play with my buttons till you find something we both enjoy. [Bender growls sexfully.] Oh, gosh! That came out all wrong!"
Love and Rocket,Bender," Too late, baby, you said it! So, what'll it be? My place ... or you?"
Love and Rocket,Fry," Before we deliver these hearts, I'm gonna find the one that sums up my feelings for you. [He picks up a handful.] ""I Love You."" Hmm, too conventional. ""You're My Man."" Ooh, so close!"
Love and Rocket,Leela," I'm not impressed by a guy's message, Fry, I'm impressed by the guy. Or not."
Love and Rocket,Fry, Whoa!
Love and Rocket,Leela, What was that?
Love and Rocket,Fry, Maybe we hit a space cow.
Love and Rocket,Bender," Coochie, coochie!"
Love and Rocket,Ship, [giggling] Stop it! You're mussing up my trajectory!
Love and Rocket,Bender," You know you love it, sugar-engine!"
Love and Rocket,Ship, [giggling] No!
Love and Rocket,Leela, Bender! [Bender panics.] What's going on in here? [She gasps.] Planet Express Ship! Cover your shame.
Love and Rocket,Ship," It's not what it looks like. Uh, Bender was just helping me ... zip up my turbine."
Love and Rocket,Fry," Wow, Bender. Are you and the ship an item? I mean I know you're both items but-- How can you date a ship anyway? It'd be like me dating a really fat lady. And living inside her. And she'd be all like--"
Love and Rocket,Bender," Fry, in order for me to get busy at maximum efficiency, I need a girl with a big 400-ton booty."
Love and Rocket,Leela," Bender, dating your co-worker and primary mode of transportation is immoral, illogical and a violation of interstellar shipping statute 437-B."
Love and Rocket,Bender, That's what makes it so nasty!
Love and Rocket,Leela," Still, given the chance, I'd give in to urges far more shocking."
Love and Rocket,Bender," [singing]   Daisy, Daisy,"
Love and Rocket,"Give me your answer do,",
Love and Rocket,Bender," I'm half crazy,"
Love and Rocket,"All for the love of you,",
Love and Rocket,"It won't be a stylish marriage,",
Love and Rocket,Bender," I can't afford a carriage,"
Love and Rocket,Bender," But you'll look sweet,"
Love and Rocket,"Upon the seat,",
Love and Rocket,Of a bicycle built for two.,
Love and Rocket,Bender," Well, I'm sick of her."
Love and Rocket,Fry, The ship? But you just started dating.
Love and Rocket,Bender," With my mighty robot powers, I can get sick of things much quicker than you humans."
Love and Rocket,Leela, Well just remember we all still have to work together. So try and let her down easy.
Love and Rocket,Bender," In due time, Leela. But for now I'll just resume dating cheap floozies on the side."
Love and Rocket,Fry, You have much to teach us.
Love and Rocket,Leela, Doesn't it bother you even a little to be taking advantage of your girlfriend's trust?
Love and Rocket,Bender," Oh, wait, you're serious. Let me laugh even harder."
Love and Rocket,Fembot #1, What's it like being a lawyer for the Mayor's office and also the world's strongest millionaire?
Love and Rocket,Bender," Well, baby, for starters you need to be honest all the time!"
Love and Rocket,Elzar," Good evening, Bender. And to your lady friends may I say, ""Bam""!"
Love and Rocket,Fembot #2, You know Elzar?
Love and Rocket,Ship, Hm.
Love and Rocket,Fry," Huh? [He gets up and presses a button by the window. It slides up, revealing Ship hovering outside. Fry rubs his eyes.] Planet Express Ship? Is that you?"
Love and Rocket,Ship," Oh. Hi, Fry. Is Bender home?"
Love and Rocket,Fry," Uh, no. Um, I think he's at his parents'."
Love and Rocket,Ship," Oh, I see. He didn't fly there in another spaceship did he?"
Love and Rocket,Fry," Bender? No! He's an old-fashioned one-spaceship robot. Look, I'll tell him you stopped by, K?"
Love and Rocket,Ship," OK. [Fry closes the window and walks back to his bed. Almost immediately the bell rings again. He opens the window and Ship is still there.] Oh. Hi, Fry. Is he home now?"
Love and Rocket,Ship," Of all the zoos we've been to today, I like this one the best. Bender, which is your favourite nocturnal rat?"
Love and Rocket,Bender," Eh, they're all pretty unimpressive."
Love and Rocket,Ship," Oh, honey, look! The tapirs! [Bender sighs and walks over.] It says here the babies lose their pyjama-like coat after their first year. Isn't that interesting, honey?"
Love and Rocket,Bender, Yep. Mind-numbingly interesting. Ooh!
Love and Rocket,Ship, Bender! Are you looking at other women?
Love and Rocket,Bender," No, baby, never!"
Love and Rocket,Ship," Bender, don't lie! I saw you at Elzar's with those two ladies of the evening. Explain that!"
Love and Rocket,Bender," OK, I like a challenge. [muttering] No ... no. [talking] Ah, I got it! I'm going to be completely honest with you, Planet Express Ship. Those women you saw me with ... were my accountants."
Love and Rocket,Ship," Your accountants? Oh, I would dearly love to believe that were true. So I do."
Love and Rocket,Bender, Phew!
Love and Rocket,Ship, I'm gonna go home and get dinner started.
Love and Rocket,Liu, Who are you talking to?
Love and Rocket,Bender," No one, baby! Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender."
Love and Rocket,Liu, I love you--
Love and Rocket,Leela," Planet Express Ship, is something wrong?"
Love and Rocket,Ship," Oh, it's Bender. He's acting so strange lately. [She gasps.] Do you think he's going to ask me to marry him?"
Love and Rocket,Leela," Uh, no."
Love and Rocket,Ship," Oh, somebody knows something she's not telling!"
Love and Rocket,Leela," Look, I'm not saying Bender's not great but have you ever considered that maybe he's, y'know, not that great?"
Love and Rocket,Ship, You're just jealous. No one loves you cause you're tiny and you're made of meat.
Love and Rocket,Leela, Could you maybe pay a little more attention to these asteroids?
Love and Rocket,Ship," Sorry, Captain Leela. I guess I'm just having one of those manic Mondays!"
Love and Rocket,Lrrr," This is ancient Earth's most foolish program. Why does Ross, the largest friend, not simply eat the other five?"
Love and Rocket,Nd-Nd, Perhaps they are saving that for sweeps.
Love and Rocket,Guard," Exalted leaders, the Earth messengers have arrived bearing a peace offering from their weak and fearful government."
Love and Rocket,Lrrr," Oh, very well. This is a Joey-heavy episode anyway. [He turns the TV off. Enter Leela, Fry and Bender with the barrels of candy hearts.] I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8."
Love and Rocket,Leela," [reading] Esteemed potentates of Omicron Persei 8, please accept these 20 billion candy hearts as proof that Earth loves you this much!"
Love and Rocket,Lrrr, These candies are choky and unpleasant!
Love and Rocket,Nd-Nd," And what is this emotion you humans call ""wuv""?"
Love and Rocket,Lrrr," Surely it says ""love""?"
Love and Rocket,Nd-Nd," No, ""wuv"". With an Earth ""W"". Behold!"
Love and Rocket,Lrrr," [shouting] This concept of ""wuv"" confuses and infuriates us!"
Love and Rocket,Fry, Incoming torpedoes. Shields at maximum yarnell!
Love and Rocket,Leela," Steady, Planet Express Ship. Focus on diverting all power to the scramjets."
Love and Rocket,Bender," Uh, look, Planet Express Ship, this might not be the best time, but, well, I really like you and whatever, but, I think we should just be friends."
Love and Rocket,Ship, [screaming] Nooo!
Love and Rocket,Bender, So we're cool?
Love and Rocket,Leela," Well, it was a spectacular battle but there doesn't seem to be any permanent damage."
Love and Rocket,Ship, [crying] No damage? What about my feelings?
Love and Rocket,Leela," Aw, calm down. I'm sure Bender is taking this just as hard as you are."
Love and Rocket,Bender," [singing] Bender is great, oh, Bender is great. Bender, Bender, Bender!"
Love and Rocket,Fry," You could've have picked a better time to dump the ship, Bender!"
Love and Rocket,Bender," Ah, the moment seemed right. Call me old-fashioned but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating."
Love and Rocket,Leela," I know. I know. Look, Ship, if there's one thing I learned from my mutual break-up with Sean that was totally mutual, it's that happiness can only come from within you."
Love and Rocket,Ship, [crying] But Bender is within me! There must be some way to make him love me again.
Love and Rocket,Leela, Trust me. You can't change men anymore than you can change the laws of time and space.
Love and Rocket,Ship," That is so true. [She changes course.] I may not be able to change the laws of time and space, but I know something that can."
Love and Rocket,Leela," Um, sweetie? You see that giant quasar we're heading into? You might wanna scooch a few parsecs to the left."
Love and Rocket,Ship," [à la HAL] I'm afraid I can't do that, Leela."
Love and Rocket,Fry, What's happening? Space cow?
Love and Rocket,Leela, The ship's just taking the break-up a little hard. [whispering] She's nuts!
Love and Rocket,Ship," In a few moments, the power of 10 billion black holes will smush me and Bender together into a beautiful eternal quantum singularity."
Love and Rocket,Bender," Uh, you don't need to kill us, Planet Express Ship ... because ... I love you. Oh, yeah, baby! I feel like doing stuff for you and stuff."
Love and Rocket,Ship," Hmm. I don't believe you. If you really wanted to be with me, you'd merge your programming with mine."
Love and Rocket,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down! All my friends who've done that said that afterwards all the passion went out of their relationship."
Love and Rocket,Leela," Look, I don't know if you want my opinion--"
Love and Rocket,Ship," Leela, Bender and I really need to be alone, so I'm turning off the oxygen."
Love and Rocket,Leela," Now look, missy! If you don't turn around now, I'm going to have to shut down your brain."
Love and Rocket,Ship, Fire detected in the vicinity of Leela.
Love and Rocket,Fry, Ha! That barely hurt Leela at all!
Love and Rocket,Ship, Maybe not. But what if the artificial gravity were to malfunction?
Love and Rocket,Bender, Float for your lives!
Love and Rocket,Leela, This is the one place she can't hear us. Everyone just pretend to shower.
Love and Rocket,Fry," Same as everyday, got it."
Love and Rocket,Leela," Now, here's the plan."
Love and Rocket,Ship," Oh, if only I could read lips."
Love and Rocket,Leela," Comprendez, Bender? You'll have to distract her. Merge your programming with hers while I shut down her brain."
Love and Rocket,Bender," It's too risky. I'm a very meek individual. If her personality engulfs mine, the Bender you know and worship could disappear forever!"
Love and Rocket,Leela, I'm willing to take that risk.
Love and Rocket,Bender," Hey, pookums! Contrary to what I was saying earlier, melding minds with you would be extremely bearable."
Love and Rocket,Ship, You really mean it?
Love and Rocket,Bender," Uh... [He looks at his hand. ""Yes"" is written on it.] Yes!"
Love and Rocket,Bender, Huh? Tubes? You're older than you said you were!
Love and Rocket,Ship," Come closer, Bender. Let's become one!"
Love and Rocket,Bender, I prefer two. That way we can still be a horse for Hallowe'en!
Love and Rocket,Leela," OK, Bender has her distracted. Now I can shut down her brain by deactivating the carbonated logic matrix. [The carbonated logic matrix looks like several fizzy drinks cans. She opens one of them and grunts.] I can't concentrate with this obnoxious candy in my face."
Love and Rocket,Fry, I'm on it. And maybe I'll find those magic words while I'm at it.
Love and Rocket,Leela, Fat chance.
Love and Rocket,Fry," Yeah, I know [He eats one of the hearts and makes a disgusted noise.] Ooh! How 'bout this one?"
Love and Rocket,Leela," Give it up, Fry! I've got to pop these tops in a precise order."
Love and Rocket,Leela, Halfway there. The ship should be getting a bit less rational now.
Love and Rocket,Ship, Want ... engulf ... Bender!
Love and Rocket,Leela, Only a few more. [She pops another one.] Hey! I won free admission to Six Flags! Just one more reason we must survive this.
Love and Rocket,Fry," Um, Leela?"
Love and Rocket,Leela," Fry! I'll read your candy later, when we're not dead! [Fry takes in a last puff of air and connects his oxygen supply to Leela's mask.] What was that?"
Love and Rocket,Fry," [suffocating] Oh, nothing."
Love and Rocket,Ship," We're gonna love being each other, you sexy ion!"
Love and Rocket,Bender, [screaming] Nooo!
Love and Rocket,Leela, Last one!
Love and Rocket,Leela," It worked! Gravity normal, air returning. Terror replaced by cautious optimism! We did it, Fry! [She looks over and sees his lifeless body.] Fry? [She sees her oxygen supply is at zero and her face mask is connected to Fry's tank and gasps.] You gave me your oxygen? Oh, no! Breathe, Fry! Breathe! [She turns him over and tries to resuscitate him. He coughs and spits out a candy heart. It sticks to her cheek. She takes it off.] [reading] You leave me breathless. [Fry smiles.] [talking] Happy Valentine's Day, Fry."
Love and Rocket,Fry, [gasping] Happy Valentine's day.
Love and Rocket,Fry, Bender! Are you OK?
Love and Rocket,Bender," Aw, what crazy thing am I going to date next?"
Love and Rocket,Leela, Well at least it sounds like you were able to keep your consciousness separate from hers.
Love and Rocket,Bender, Of course! Bender is a lone wolf. A solitary eagle. [Ship's voice] A cuddly baby tapir! [normal] And that's why I love him!
Love and Rocket,Fry," Well, I guess we'd better clean up these millions of hearts."
Love and Rocket,Leela," Nah, I've got a lazier idea."
Love and Rocket,Zoidberg," [voice-over] As the candy hearts poured into the fiery quasar, a wondrous thing happened, why not. They vaporised into a mystical love radiation that spread across the universe, destroying many, many planets, including two gangster planets and a cowboy world. But one planet was at exactly the right distance to see the romantic rays, but not be destroyed by them  Earth. So all over the world, couples stood together in joy. And me, Zoidberg! And no one could have been happier unless it would have also been Valentine's Day. What? It was? Hooray!"
Love and Rocket,,
Less than Hero,SewerCom Operator, [on phone] [pleasant female voice] Your call is being [gruff male voice] connected [pleasant female voice] by SewerCom. Reach out and touch the sewers.
Less than Hero,Munda," [on screen] Look, Morris, it's Leela calling."
Less than Hero,Leela," Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Ready for your big trip to the surface?"
Less than Hero,Morris," [on screen] We're excited, honey, but we don't wanna embarrass you. I mean, your mother and I are basically monsters."
Less than Hero,Leela," Dad, relax. You are being so mutant!"
Less than Hero,Munda, [on screen] I found this adorable little bag to wear over my head. [She puts it on.] And it was on sale!
Less than Hero,Leela," No one's wearing anything adorable over their head. Now listen, I could never, ever be ashamed of my parents. I'll see you this weekend."
Less than Hero,Leela," Hey, guess who I just got off the videophone with?"
Less than Hero,Bender, No.
Less than Hero,Leela, My parents! They're coming up from the sewers for a visit Sunday.
Less than Hero,Amy," Are you off your rocket? Your parents are mutants. It's illegal for them to come above ground 'cause they're inferior genetic scum. Uh, present company excluded, of course."
Less than Hero,Leela, I'm getting them a special one-day surface permit from Citihall.
Less than Hero,Hermes," Ooh. While you're there, could you pick me up a licence to kill?"
Less than Hero,Leela, Sure. Bare hands or weapon?
Less than Hero,Hermes," Uh, what does piano wire count as?"
Less than Hero,Farnsworth," Good news, anyone. The Swedish robot from Pi-kea is here with the super collider I ordered."
Less than Hero,πkea Robot, Enjoy your affordable Swedish crap.
Less than Hero,Fry," Let's see what tools we'll need. [Hammer.] Uh-huh. [Screwdriver.] Uh-huh. [Bending unit.] Uh-huh. Alright, we're all set."
Less than Hero,Bender, Nothing like the rustic wholesomeness of working with one's own hand.
Less than Hero,Bender," Ah, there. Finished. And with only six missing pieces!"
Less than Hero,Fry, Those Swedes sure know how to put in almost everything you need.
Less than Hero,Leela," Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with Mighty Thor."
Less than Hero,Fry, I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.
Less than Hero,Zoidberg," I've got just the thing  Genuine miracle cream I bought from a travelling salesman. [Fry and Leela squeeze some onto their hands and rub it on themselves.] ""Come one, come all,"" he said. ""Step right up!"" ""This sounds too good to be true,"" I thought. He said I looked like a smart, young man. ""So is it a deal?"" I enquired. Two hours later he was gone, with 60 of my dollars. But I have the miracle cream--"
Less than Hero,Farnsworth," Bad news, nobody. The super collider super-exploded. I need you to take it back and exchange it for a wobbly CD rack and some of those rancid meatballs."
Less than Hero,Man #1, Excuse me. hi! Do you have a minute? I live in Jersey City and my car broke down and I need to get back because my Aunt's real sick and she needs this medicine but I need money for the bus. So I'm mugging you. Hand over your wallets.
Less than Hero,Leela, I don't believe that story for a second.
Less than Hero,Man #1," It doesn't matter, I'm mugging you."
Less than Hero,Fry, There's no bus to Jersey City.
Less than Hero,Man #1, Give me your wallets now or my robot'll shoot.
Less than Hero,Andrew, Don't make me hurt you.
Less than Hero,Fry," I'm too scared to find my pocket. Here, I'll just take of my pants and give you those."
Less than Hero,Man #1," Hey! I don't like what I'm seeing. Give it to him, Andrew! [Fry screams and Andrew shoots. The laser bounces off Fry and takes a chunk out of a wall.] Give it to him again, Andrew! [Andrew shoots and the laser bounces off Fry again and hits an Illegal Fireworks dispenser. The fuses light and they fly off in all directions.] What the-- Laser-proof shirts, huh? I'll show you."
Less than Hero,Leela, Huh? Hey! Quit it! [She leaps up.] Hi-yah!
Less than Hero,Man #1, Foiled. And after years of planning.
Less than Hero,Andrew, You're outta the game!
Less than Hero,Leela, How did we manage to survive? What gave us those strange powers?
Less than Hero,Fry," Maybe we're all wearing magic rings but they're invisible rings so we don't even realise it. Also, you can't feel the rings."
Less than Hero,Leela," Fry, shut up and look at this! [reading] May cause superpowers in humans."
Less than Hero,Fry, Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub into your skin? You'd think it'd be something you have to freebase.
Less than Hero,Leela, Let's see. Which powers do we have? Super-strength?
Less than Hero,Fry, Yup.
Less than Hero,Leela, Uh-huh. Lickety speed?
Less than Hero,Fry, Check.
Less than Hero,Leela," Yes, sir! [They run back.] Ability to command the loyalty of sea creatures?"
Less than Hero,Fry," [shouting] Hey, Zoidberg, get in here!"
Less than Hero,Zoidberg, [shouting; from elsewhere] Screw you!
Less than Hero,Leela, Ain't got that.
Less than Hero,Fry, Nope!
Less than Hero,Leela, Wow. Superpowers! I'll be able to pack my day with twice as many humdrum activities.
Less than Hero,Fry," Leela, I think you're missing the big picture. When you were a kid, what was your biggest fantasy?"
Less than Hero,Leela, To have parents.
Less than Hero,Fry, Whatever. The correct answer is  To be a superhero. We have superpowers and we're Americans. This is our chance.
Less than Hero,Leela, Hmm. I have been looking for a way to serve the community that incorporates my violence. Let's do it!
Less than Hero,Fry, You'll barely regret this!
Less than Hero,Bender," Hey, a friend of mine said he mugged you today and you had superpowers."
Less than Hero,Leela, It's true. Thanks to this funky-fresh cream.
Less than Hero,Fry, Now me and Leela are forming an awesome crime-fighting duo.
Less than Hero,Bender," Wow! Crime-fighting. Cool. You say you're a duo? Yeah, duos are good. Of course sometimes they're a little short-handed. [He starts walking back up the steps.] See you. With two humans, you'd think there'd be a robot in there to balance things out but whatever. [He opens his chest cabinet.] I have these three costumes you could use. But I guess I'll just throw one away."
Less than Hero,Leela," We'd love to have you on the team, Bender. But aren't you more on the supply side of crime?"
Less than Hero,Fry, Plus the cream won't give you superpowers. You're a robot.
Less than Hero,Bender," So? I'm already super-strong. And my arms do this. [He reaches over to the other end of the hangar, grabs a bottle of beer, retracts his arm and hands the bottle to Fry.] Also I got this going."
Less than Hero,Leela," [shouting] Listen up, New New York  There's a new group of superheroes in town! And we're--"
Less than Hero,Hattie, [shouting; from elsewhere] Quiet! It's 4am and I just fell asleep for the first time in 30 years!
Less than Hero,Leela, [shouting] Sorry! [whispering] A new era of justice has begun.
Less than Hero,Hattie, [shouting; from elsewhere] What?
Less than Hero,Narrator," [voice-over] Attention, all crooks, lowlifes and lawbreakers. Do yourselves a favour and crawl back into your filthy tenements, you human cockroaches. Or get your ugly face punched to custard by ... The New Justice Team."
Less than Hero,Fry, Captain Yesterday!
Less than Hero,Leela, Clobberella!
Less than Hero,Bender, And Superking! The best one of the three!
Less than Hero,Fry, [à la James Brown] Wow!
Less than Hero,Song," Go, go, go, New Justice Team,"
Less than Hero,Song," Go, team,"
Less than Hero,"Go, team,",
Less than Hero,"Team, team, team,",
Less than Hero,Song, Who's the newest Justice Team?
Less than Hero,The New Justice Team!,
Less than Hero,Song," Captain Yesterday is fast,"
Less than Hero,"Also he is from the past,",
Less than Hero,"Not just fast but from the past,",
Less than Hero,Song, Captain Yesterday!
Less than Hero,Song," Superking has all the powers of a king,"
Less than Hero,"Plus all the powers of Superman,",
Less than Hero,"Also he's a robot,",
Less than Hero,Ain't it cool?,
Less than Hero,"Superking, you rule!",
Less than Hero,Song," Clobberella beats you up,"
Less than Hero,"Clobberella beats you up,",
Less than Hero,Who does she beat up?,
Less than Hero,You!,
Less than Hero,Song, Clobberella!
Less than Hero,Song," Citizens, never fear,"
Less than Hero,"Crazy do-good freaks are here,",
Less than Hero,Until they run out of steam...,
Less than Hero,Song," Miracle cream,"
Less than Hero,"Miracle cream,",
Less than Hero,"Gives the power to the team,",
Less than Hero,Song," It's effects wear off for sure,"
Less than Hero,"So they just slop on some more,",
Less than Hero,The New Justice Team!,
Less than Hero,Bender, Ta-da!
Less than Hero,Woman," [sexfully] Captain Yesterday, I find your skintight high-waters incredibly sexy. Let's get together sometime."
Less than Hero,Fry, Sure. I'm listed in the phone book so once I reveal my real name to you along with my home address and a copy of my birth certificate--
Less than Hero,Leela, Are you crazy? We have to keep our secret identities secret.
Less than Hero,Fry, From everybody?
Less than Hero,Leela, Especially from everybody.
Less than Hero,Fry, Give several reasons why.
Less than Hero,Leela," For one, superheroes cause a lot of collateral damage, and we don't wanna get our butts sued."
Less than Hero,Fry," Or do we? No, I guess not."
Less than Hero,Leela," Also, if our identities get out, every crook in the city will be after us. Or, God forbid, our loved ones."
Less than Hero,Bender," Superking has no need for loved ones. [Tinny Tim holds out a pad for Superking's autograph. Bender signs it and kicks his crutch away. He falls down in a crumpled heap.] How ya doin', kid?"
Less than Hero,Poopenmeyer, There you go. Two one-day mutant surface passes.
Less than Hero,Leela," Thank you, Mayor Poopenmeyer."
Less than Hero,Poopenmeyer, Mayor here. What's that? Horrible crime in the works? Ruthless villain? Citizens in danger? That's fantastic news! [He hangs up.] Because I get to summon the New Justice Team!
Less than Hero,Leela, Sh!
Less than Hero,Poopenmeyer," Uh, they're usually here by now."
Less than Hero,Leela," Well, so long. Keep in touch."
Less than Hero,Poopenmeyer," Wait, stay and meet the superheroes. There's three of you and three of them so it'll be perfect. [He turns around and presses the button again. Bender wobbles again.] Is this clown on? Where are those daring crime stoppers?"
Less than Hero,Leela," Oh, I completely forgot. I left my apartment on fire!"
Less than Hero,Bender," Uh, as for me, I'm late for my LSAT's."
Less than Hero,Fry, And I can't take life anymore.
Less than Hero,Poopenmeyer, Clobberella! Captain Yesterday! My liege! You're just in time. [He presses a button and a hologram appears.] We've received a tip that the Museum of Natural History will be robbed tomorrow at exactly 9am. The target  The priceless Quantum Gemerald.
Less than Hero,Fry, Who's the perp?
Less than Hero,Poopenmeyer," A dangerous villain known as The Zookeeper, who commits crimes aided by a pack of highly-trained animals."
Less than Hero,Fry, Pack of highly. Got it!
Less than Hero,Poopenmeyer," His crew includes a badger with a troubled past and nothing left to lose, an elephant who never forgets -- to kill! And a seldom-used crab named Lucky, a.k.a. Citizen Snips."
Less than Hero,Leela," You can count on us, Mr. Mayor. Justice away!"
Less than Hero,Bender, [gasping] Hold the elevator!
Less than Hero,Bender, We're in here too.
Less than Hero,Fry," Uh, Leela, how you gonna meet your folks tomorrow? We've already scheduled the Zookeeper for a 9am foiling at the museum."
Less than Hero,Leela, Not a problem. I've cleverly arranged to meet my parents right there at the same museum at 10.
Less than Hero,Bender," 9, 10 a big fat hen. [He takes a puff of his cigar.] The name's Bender!"
Less than Hero,Leela, I can't believe the Zookeeper is this late for his own heist. It's just rude! [The clock strikes 10.] Total hell! It's 10! I'm supposed to meet my parents and I'm still in my secret costume! [Enter Morris and Munda. Leela gasps.] There they are!
Less than Hero,Munda, How could Leela not be here? Do you think she forgot?
Less than Hero,Morris, Relax. I'm sure she's just ashamed of us.
Less than Hero,Security Guard," Yo! Freakjobs! Hit the nearest manhole, pronto, like."
Less than Hero,Morris, But we have passes that allow us to be up here. From the mayor himself.
Less than Hero,Security Guard, I dunno. I never heard of no mayor.
Less than Hero,Randy, The Zookeeper!
Less than Hero,Zookeeper, Sorry I'm late. Long story. Now everybody hit the deck! I'm cutting the entire line and stealing the exhibit.
Less than Hero,Leela, You're not stealing anything! Nobody hit the deck!
Less than Hero,Zookeeper," Ah, the superheroes. Or should I say superzeroes!"
Less than Hero,Fry, [sad] That was uncalled for.
Less than Hero,Zookeeper," Animals, attack."
Less than Hero,Tour Guide, Please do not feed the animals!
Less than Hero,Bender," You're going down, my friend! Down Under!"
Less than Hero,Roosevelt, Man boxing a kangaroo is a peculiar spectacle. But a kangaroo boxing a robot? Now I'm afraid you've lost me. [A crab drops into his jar and pinches him.] [shouting] Citizen Snips!
Less than Hero,Zookeeper," Nice job, Fingers!"
Less than Hero,Munda, I'm scared and confused. I think we've wandered into an off-Broadway play.
Less than Hero,Morris," No, there are way too many people here."
Less than Hero,Zookeeper," Later, if anyone asks when I got away, tell them right now!"
Less than Hero,Leela," Forget it, Zookeeper! You're going into captivity."
Less than Hero,Zookeeper," Fool! A quip about putting me behind bars would have been far more delicious. Here, catch!"
Less than Hero,Leela," No, Fry! You can't fall fast enough!"
Less than Hero,Bender," I got it, I got it! [He screams.] I don't got it!"
Less than Hero,Roosevelt, You've saved the Gemerald!
Less than Hero,Fry," Yet the Zookeeper escaped, thus proving that the deadliest animal of all is the Zookeeper."
Less than Hero,Bender, You can get off me anytime.
Less than Hero,Leela," Oh, no! My parents are leaving. I've gotta go change back into street-Leela."
Less than Hero,Photographer #1, It's the New Justice Team!
Less than Hero,Photographer #2, Can we get some photos?
Less than Hero,Poopenmeyer," Thank you, mysterious heroes. The value of the Gemerald you saved is slightly greater than the cost of the damage you caused to this museum. A net gain for our great city!"
Less than Hero,Munda, It's good that Leela doesn't love us. She'll be less sad when we die.
Less than Hero,Leela, Mom? Dad? I showed up! And I got the audio tour for Treasures of Liberace's Tomb.
Less than Hero,Morris," Sweetie, it's OK. You don't have to apologise for standing us up on the only visit to the surface we'll ever have."
Less than Hero,Leela," I wanna tell you why I didn't show up, but I can't. Just please believe me that it was a very good reason. I'm sorry I disappointed you."
Less than Hero,Munda," Leela, you could never disappoint us."
Less than Hero,Morris," We're so proud of everything that you are, and we always will be. Because you're our baby girl."
Less than Hero,Leela," Oh, I can't take it! Mom, Dad, I'm Clobberella!"
Less than Hero,Morris, Galloping gators!
Less than Hero,Munda, You're a superhero? [She laughs.] Well that's wonderful! But did you have to make the costume so revealing?
Less than Hero,Morris, Look at me! Proud dad of a superhero! We should print up T-shirts. And F-shirts for our friends with two arms on the same side.
Less than Hero,Leela," No, listen. It's very important that you never, ever tell anyone under any circumstance."
Less than Hero,Morris, What if I've had a few?
Less than Hero,Leela," Dad, you drink? No. Not even then."
Less than Hero,Morris, Alright. My sucker is sealed.
Less than Hero,Leela," In fact, I shouldn't even be wearing this around here. [She rips off her costume, revealing her normal clothes. Morris and Munda stare.] It was brisk, I dressed in layers."
Less than Hero,Munda, That's my girl!
Less than Hero,Morris," So, uh, anyway, my daughter's Clobberella."
Less than Hero,Raoul, Leela is Clobberella?
Less than Hero,Leg Mutant, You're pulling me!
Less than Hero,Morris, Sh. keep it under your sock. It's a big secret. That's why I'm only telling you two.
Less than Hero,Big-Eared Mutant," Oh, my God! That guy's daughter is Clobberella. But don't tell anyone."
Less than Hero,Big-Mouthed Mutant, [shouting] Gotcha!
Less than Hero,Zookeeper," [on screen] Greetings, superheroes. Remember me?"
Less than Hero,Farnsworth," I don't remember much, buddy. And you're no looker!"
Less than Hero,Leela," Uh, Professor, isn't it time for your nap?"
Less than Hero,Farnsworth," Yes, damnit!"
Less than Hero,Leela, Zookeeper! How did you know our real identities?
Less than Hero,Zookeeper, [on screen] Let's just say a little bird told me.
Less than Hero,Parrot, [on screen] Leela told her parents. Leela's parents blabbed.
Less than Hero,Fry," Leela, is the person that parrot is mimicking telling the truth by proxy?"
Less than Hero,Leela," Yes. My parents were so hurt, I couldn't help it! But I distinctly told them not to tell anyone."
Less than Hero,Bender, We are not amused.
Less than Hero,Zookeeper, [on screen] And here's something you may or may not find interesting.
Less than Hero,Leela, Mom! Dad!
Less than Hero,Munda," [on screen] Leela, please forgive us! Especially your father who's the one who told. Thank you very much, Morris."
Less than Hero,Leela, Are you alright? Has he hurt you?
Less than Hero,Morris," [on screen] No but my allergies are going nuts. [He sneezes.] Oh, God!"
Less than Hero,Munda, [on screen] Every couch and table has animal fur all over it. He lets them climb on everything!
Less than Hero,Leela," Alright, Zookeeper. What do you want?"
Less than Hero,Zookeeper," [on screen] Why, the Quantum Gemerald of course! You must steal it for me before midnight or your parents will be devoured by piranhas that I have, shall I say, persuaded to walk on dry land."
Less than Hero,Munda," [on screen] Save us, Leela! I mean, if you don't have anything better to do."
Less than Hero,Leela, We're out of options. We have to steal the Gemerald!
Less than Hero,Fry," But, should superheroes commit a crime, even to save lives? I need moral guidance. Bender?"
Less than Hero,Bender," Hmm. The thought of stealing anything fills Superking with disgust. But if it must be so, then let a museum heist be pulled!"
Less than Hero,Fry," Oh, no! Our superpower cream is out of itself!"
Less than Hero,Leela, Check inside the cap. There might be a caked-in goldmine.
Less than Hero,Fry, El zilcho! I'm afraid we're boned.
Less than Hero,Bender, El zilcho? Is it too late to change my superhero name?
Less than Hero,Leela, Just be cool. Nobody knows we're super-powerly challenged.
Less than Hero,Fry," Man, this costume is so damn heavy!"
Less than Hero,7¹¹ Clerk," Hey, Captain Yesterday? Can I, like, wail on you with this 2-by-4 and it doesn't hurt you?"
Less than Hero,Fry, Ow! That ... didn't hurt.
Less than Hero,Security Guard," Hi, superheroes. Everything OK?"
Less than Hero,Leela," Big O, little k, my friend! Just checking if everything's alright."
Less than Hero,Security Guard," It's OK, alright!"
Less than Hero,Leela," OK, then. Grab it!"
Less than Hero,Tate, Yo! The superheroes have turned evil! Most uncool.
Less than Hero,Security Guard, Get 'em!
Less than Hero,Leela," Stay back! Or we'll, beat the tar out of you ... using superpowers!"
Less than Hero,Fry, So this is your lair?
Less than Hero,Zookeeper, Of course not. You think I'd show you my lair? My lair's a million times nicer than this!
Less than Hero,Fry," OK, take it easy!"
Less than Hero,Bender," Well, here's your lousy Gemerald."
Less than Hero,Zookeeper, Hawk! Fetch!
Less than Hero,Fry, That seemed unnecessary.
Less than Hero,Zookeeper," Our transaction is complete. Come, Solomon. To the lair."
Less than Hero,Leela," Mom! Dad! Oh, I'm so sorry I got you kidnapped by a crazy madman who tried to feed you to piranhas."
Less than Hero,Munda, We're just happy to be involved in your life.
Less than Hero,Leela," No, no. It's my fault for telling you I was a superhero."
Less than Hero,Morris, That's true.
Less than Hero,Leela, I just couldn't stand to have you to think I was ashamed of you.
Less than Hero,Munda," That's sweet, honey. But it's natural for children to be a little ashamed of their parents."
Less than Hero,Fry," Oh, yeah!"
Less than Hero,Morris, Just like it's natural for parents to be a little disappointed in their children-- N-Not that we are.
Less than Hero,Munda, But you could call a little more often.
Less than Hero,Leela, OK.
Less than Hero,Munda, And would it kill you to use some mouthwash?
Less than Hero,Bender," Hey, Fry, we've still got our costumes on. Wanna steal some more stuff?"
Less than Hero,Fry," I guess, as long as you think it's right."
Less than Hero,Bender, Superheroes away!
Less than Hero,Song," Go, go, go, New Justice Team,"
Less than Hero,"Fighting justice is their quest,",
Less than Hero,"Superking, Clobberella, and all the rest,",
Less than Hero,"Here's to you, New Justice Team,",
Less than Hero,"Do the things that make your team,",
Less than Hero,"Help each other do some things,",
Less than Hero,"Winners don't use drugs,",
Less than Hero,The New Justice Team!,
Less than Hero,,
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg," [singing] Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!"
A Taste of Freedom,"Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!",
A Taste of Freedom,Fry," There's no denying it, the future's crazy! Oh, well. Don't wanna stand out."
A Taste of Freedom,Fry and Zoidberg," [singing] Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!"
A Taste of Freedom,"Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!",
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg, There's nothing crazy about it. It's just Freedom Day!
A Taste of Freedom,Farnsworth, ...an extremely dangerous mission...
A Taste of Freedom,Fry," So, what is Freedom Day? Sounds like some kind of feminine hygiene product."
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg," No, it's a fabulous, crab-ulous day!"
A Taste of Freedom,Amy," If you wanna do something, you do it, and to splick with the consequences!"
A Taste of Freedom,Bender," You know, like how I live every day."
A Taste of Freedom,Hermes, Happy Freedom Day! Ooh! I think my wrist is broken.
A Taste of Freedom,Farnsworth," Of course, it wouldn't be Freedom Day without the traditional Freedom Tub!"
A Taste of Freedom,Hermes, Mmm! That'll feel nice on my shattered bones!
A Taste of Freedom,Fry, Wow! Nude hot-tubbing? That's all I need to hear about Freedom Day!
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg," Then consider the following lecture a bonus  On Earth, freedom is a given. But on my planet, we have to suffer for it."
A Taste of Freedom,Decapodian Woman," Sure, you can be a comedian instead of a doctor -- if you want your parents to roll over in their graves!"
A Taste of Freedom,Decapodian Man," Sure, you can vote for Shkinadel -- if you want there should be a recession!"
A Taste of Freedom,Decapodian Woman," Sure, you can go to medical school -- if you've given up on your dream of being a comedian!"
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg," That's why I love Earth! You can do what you want, and no one makes you feel guilty because no one cares."
A Taste of Freedom,Fry, [shouting] We're not listening!
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg, That's what I'm talking about!
A Taste of Freedom,Stilt People," [chanting] Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!"
A Taste of Freedom,"Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!",
A Taste of Freedom,Bender," Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train arriving on track one."
A Taste of Freedom,Woman, Ow! You broke my foot!
A Taste of Freedom,Bender, Freedom!
A Taste of Freedom,Morbo," What's this next float, Linda?"
A Taste of Freedom,Linda," Representing our men, women and children in uniform, it's Earth's greatest space hero, Zapp Brannigan!"
A Taste of Freedom,Zapp," Happy Freedom Day, ladies! [He throws some beads.] Come on, let loose and show me something! [He throws more beads.] Anything. Seriously, I'd take an armpit. [Kif sighs.] Oh, yeah! Thank you, Linda!"
A Taste of Freedom,Linda," You're welcome! OK, Morbo, now it's your turn."
A Taste of Freedom,Morbo, If that is your Freedom Day wish.
A Taste of Freedom,Nixon," Thank you, Secretary of Transportation. My fellow Earthicans, we enjoy so much freedom it's almost sickening. We're free to choose which hand our sex-monitoring chip is implanted in. And if we don't want to pay our taxes, why, we're free to spend a weekend with the Pain Monster."
A Taste of Freedom,Pain Monster," See you April 15th, folks!"
A Taste of Freedom,Nixon," Cue the fireworks guy! [A man jets up to the sky and blows up a firework.] Incidentally, tonight's Freedom Day celebration is brought to you by ... [A firework explodes and ""Shankman"" lights up the sky.] ... ""Shankman's Rubbing Compound"".  When something needs rubbing, think ""Shankman""."
A Taste of Freedom,Bender, Yay! Shankman!
A Taste of Freedom,Hermes, It costs a little more but it's worth it!
A Taste of Freedom,Nixon," Our planet has been through so much this past year  Wars, droughts, impeachments! But we've never lost our sense of what's truly important  The great taste of ""Charleston Chew""! [A ""Charleston Chew"" firework explodes.] And now, let us salute that beloved symbol of freedom, our flag, Ol' Freebie!"
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg, I'm swelling with patriotic mucus!
A Taste of Freedom,Nixon," In our darkest hour we can stand erect, with proud, upthrust bosoms!"
A Taste of Freedom,Fry, Anyone who laughs is a Communist!
A Taste of Freedom,Nixon," Knowing that, with a shifty glance skyward, we will see by the rocket's red glare that our flag is still there. [He turns around.] It's gone!"
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg," Yes, fellow patriots, I ate your flag. And I did it with pride. For to express oneself with doing a thing is the very essence of Freedom Day! Bless this planet and all its wonderful people!"
A Taste of Freedom,Nixon, [shouting] Kill him! Kill the traitor!
A Taste of Freedom,Man #1," Hey, it's the guy who desecrated our flag!"
A Taste of Freedom,Nixon, Stop that red menace!
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg, I'm all scuttled out! [He looks up and sees something.] Huh? My planet's embassy? They're paid to not kill me! A-yoop!
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg," I thought I understood this world. I thought I was fitting in. But I guess I don't belong on here anymore than I belong on our crappy home planet-- Ooh, sorry."
A Taste of Freedom,Decapodian Man," What sorry? Our planet stinks, we all know it."
A Taste of Freedom,Ambassador Mervin," Enough with the persecution, I'm saying. Zoidberg, as Ambassador, I promise you the full support of our government, already."
A Taste of Freedom,Decapodian Woman, Poor boy. You want maybe a nice mug cocoa?
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg," Ambassador Mervin, you and your staff are so kind. I'm truly humbled. [The woman comes back in with the cocoa and hands it to Zoidberg.] What, no marshmallows?"
A Taste of Freedom,Nixon, Let's storm the place ... without my prior knowledge.
A Taste of Freedom,Bender," Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train, step aside. You too, fatso. Freedom!"
A Taste of Freedom,Leela," Cool your jowls, Nixon. You may not like it that Dr. Zoidberg desecrated a flag. You might even find the image of it festering in his bowels somehow offensive. But the right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Earth Constitution."
A Taste of Freedom,Nixon, Aroo! Maybe so. But I know a place where the Constitution doesn't mean squat.
A Taste of Freedom,Myrtle Fu, The Supreme Court hereby accepts the case of Earth vs. Zoidberg.
A Taste of Freedom,Nixon, Sock it to 'em!
A Taste of Freedom,Crowd," [chanting] Two, four, six, eight,"
A Taste of Freedom,Eating the flag is bad.,
A Taste of Freedom,Scout Leader, Now your noose knot has exactly seven twists.
A Taste of Freedom,Man #2, [singing] You can eat my dog. You can eat my truck.
A Taste of Freedom,But you eat my flag and you're outta luck!,
A Taste of Freedom,"She's a-wavin' proud around the world, from Dallas to Fort Worth.",
A Taste of Freedom,Let me say it again...,
A Taste of Freedom,Crowd, [chanting] Don't mess with Earth!
A Taste of Freedom,Fry, They sure hate Dr. Zoidberg.
A Taste of Freedom,Bender, Pft. Posers! I was hating Zoidberg before it was cool.
A Taste of Freedom,Fry, Where are we ever going to find a lawyer to take his case?
A Taste of Freedom,Leela, I'll ask the head of the ACLU -- once he's done singing.
A Taste of Freedom,Man #2, [singing] Don't mess with Earth. [talking] Kill Zoidberg! Goodnight!
A Taste of Freedom,Old Man Waterfall, Howdy there! I'm a lawyer and I'd like to help your friend out of his pickle.
A Taste of Freedom,Fry," Who are you, old man?"
A Taste of Freedom,Old Man Waterfall," Name's Old Man Waterfall but most folks just call me ""Old Man""."
A Taste of Freedom,Fry, I'll never remember that.
A Taste of Freedom,Old Man Waterfall," I'm a veteran of three dozen wars. Name a body part and a planet and I've taken a bullet in it, on it. All to keep our flag flying free."
A Taste of Freedom,Bender," And you wanna defend Zoidberg? Are you familiar with the old robot saying ""does not compute""?"
A Taste of Freedom,Old Man Waterfall," Son, to me a robot's just a garbage can with sparks comin' out it."
A Taste of Freedom,Bender, [sad] The sparks keep me warm.
A Taste of Freedom,Old Man Waterfall, I don't condone what Dr. Zoidberg did but I'll fight tooth and nail for his freedom to do it. Or I would if I hadn't lost my teeth and nails on Mars and Saturn respectively.
A Taste of Freedom,Fry," Wait, you're a lawyer? You're hired!"
A Taste of Freedom,Fry," You OK there in the embassy, Zoidberg?"
A Taste of Freedom,Holo-Zoidberg," No. There's no cocoa marshmallows, and every night the rats eat a little more of my foot!"
A Taste of Freedom,Bailiff," Oyez, oyez, oyez. All rise for the Honourable Chief Justice, Myrtle Fu, and the Associate Justices."
A Taste of Freedom,Myrtle Fu," Counsel, you may address the court on behalf of Earth, if you're ready."
A Taste of Freedom,Hyper-Chicken," I was hatched ready! Honourable judge heads, yonder crawdad done ate up our flag."
A Taste of Freedom,Holo-Zoidberg," I was doing freedom of speech, Earth's most sacred right."
A Taste of Freedom,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour, freedom of speech applies to what comes out of a mouth, not what goes in."
A Taste of Freedom,O'Connor, Can counsel cite precedent?
A Taste of Freedom,Hyper-Chicken," Uh, yes, darlin', I can. In State Of Alabama vs. Giant Space Iguana, chewin' the corners off the Constitution was deemed non-protected speech."
A Taste of Freedom,Souter," He shut you up, O'Connor."
A Taste of Freedom,Myrtle Fu," Mr. Waterfall, you may now present arguments on behalf of Dr. Zoidberg."
A Taste of Freedom,Holo-Zoidberg," Oh, God, I'm nervous. Two of my three hearts are having attacks."
A Taste of Freedom,Bender, Court's kinda fun when it's not my ass on the line! Nachos?
A Taste of Freedom,Old Man Waterfall," Oh, land-o-Goshen! Your Honours, I'm not some slick, big-city lawyer like my opponent here. [The Hyper-Chicken caws.] But I am a veteran who has fought for his planet. You see this hand of mine?"
A Taste of Freedom,Scalia," Yes, I do."
A Taste of Freedom,Old Man Waterfall," No, you don't [He takes it off.] 'Cause I lost my real hand plantin' the flag when we took back Halley's Comet! Yet it was worth it, so much do I love that flag. [The bench sobs.] I love it even more than I love my seven wives -- that's right, I'm a polygamist. [The court ""boos"".] Yet I would gladly eat a flag myself, had I not used my intestine as a rope to hoist a flag made of my own skin, if it would protect the freedoms of the proud people who salute that flag. [The court cheers.] Freedom such as polygamy. [The court ""boos"".] I rest my case. [He puts his hand back on and his leg falls off.] Whoa, jeez!"
A Taste of Freedom,Myrtle Fu," The Justices and I will now confer using high-speed telepathy. [The bailiff hooks them up and the Justices' heads rotate in the jars. Myrtle Fu takes off her helmet.] By a vote of six-to-three, we find that flag eating is not protected by the Constitution."
A Taste of Freedom,Bender, Six-to-three? I beat the spread!
A Taste of Freedom,Myrtle Fu, The court orders an immediate public apology.
A Taste of Freedom,Holo-Zoidberg, Apology accepted. Just don't let it happen again.
A Taste of Freedom,Hermes," She means you, you turkey of the sea!"
A Taste of Freedom,Holo-Zoidberg," Me? Apologise? Never! I came to this planet to learn the meaning of freedom, but I say it's you who should get a nice lesson! So do your worst because no punishment could be worse than denying my freedom."
A Taste of Freedom,Myrtle Fu, You are hereby sentenced to death.
A Taste of Freedom,Holo-Zoidberg," Wait, let me finish!"
A Taste of Freedom,Myrtle Fu," Also, in a rare double-whammy decision, the court finds polygamy constitutional."
A Taste of Freedom,Old Man Waterfall, I can't wait to tell my husband!
A Taste of Freedom,Zapp," Remember, men, take him alive so there's something left to kill."
A Taste of Freedom,Ambassador Mervin, Stay back! This embassy is sovereign mud of the mud planet Decapod 10. Invading these mud premises is an act of war.
A Taste of Freedom,Zapp," Yeah? Well what are you going to do about it, Shrimp-y?"
A Taste of Freedom,Ambassador Mervin," You wanna see, Mr. Big-Shot? [He speaks into a radio.] Attack Earth. [There is a pause.] Yes I know it's a schlep. Just do it!"
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg, Aha! Now the rubber band's on the other claw!
A Taste of Freedom,Zapp, Ready ... retreat!
A Taste of Freedom,Patron, [from library] Shh!
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg," Deny my freedom, will you? Well we'll do to you what we did to the Squash Men of the Squash Planet! Squish them!"
A Taste of Freedom,Ambassador Mervin, Charleston Chew?
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg, You bet!
A Taste of Freedom,Zapp," Alright, Kif, let's show these freaks what a bloated, runaway military budget can do. Bring me the activation codes for our global defence network."
A Taste of Freedom,Kif," [unenthusiastic] Aye, aye, sir."
A Taste of Freedom,Computer Voice, Commence lip identification scan. [Zapp kisses the computer.] No tongue.
A Taste of Freedom,Zapp," We can't be too careful with these codes. Rumour has it a double agent may be aboard this very ship. [He looks Kif square in the eyes.] I'm watching you! You, ensign, what's your name?"
A Taste of Freedom,"""Ensign"""," Hugh Man, sir."
A Taste of Freedom,Zapp," Hugh Man? Now that's a name I can trust. Run down to the central battle computer and enter these codes. Chop, chop!"
A Taste of Freedom,Kif," Um, sir? There's something about that ensign that's--"
A Taste of Freedom,Zapp, You're damn right there is! That strapping young lad's gunning for your job. And he just might get it.
A Taste of Freedom,Zapp," The enemy approacheth! Lieutenant, fire missile one and recommend me for another medal. Make it gaudy, I'm going clubbing later. [Kif presses a button but nothing happens. He presses it again three times.] Tick, tock!"
A Taste of Freedom,Kif," Sir, all planetary defences have been disabled. Perhaps the Decapodians acquired our secret codes, somehow."
A Taste of Freedom,Zapp," Well, Kif, stand by to take the blame. Steady, steady ... now!"
A Taste of Freedom,Leela," Dr. Zoidberg, how can you claim to love freedom and then enslave all of Earth?"
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg," Bah! Your planet doesn't deserve freedom until it learns what it is to not have freedom. It's a lesson, I say."
A Taste of Freedom,Fry, Ow!
A Taste of Freedom,Bender," What the hell is this dirt pile we're building, anyhow?"
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg," None of your beeswax, slave! You'll find out soon enough. Just focus on globing that mud. [shouting] Glob!"
A Taste of Freedom,Fry," I'm no good at being a slave. I'm thinking about graduate school. Y'know, to become a barber?"
A Taste of Freedom,Leela, This can't go on. Today is the day we fight back!
A Taste of Freedom,Bender, It's already 10 o'clock!
A Taste of Freedom,Leela," Oh, you're right. Tomorrow is the day we fight back."
A Taste of Freedom,Zapp," Yeah? Well good luck, sister. All our modern technology is useless."
A Taste of Freedom,Bender, I know I am.
A Taste of Freedom,Fry," Hey, wait! I'm having one of those things. You know, a headache with pictures?"
A Taste of Freedom,Leela, An idea?
A Taste of Freedom,Fry," Back in my day we didn't have your fancy all-digital weapons, but we still managed to kill each other just fine."
A Taste of Freedom,Bender," Ah, the crossbow. A pitiless, elegant killing machine. The Bender of the 15th century."
A Taste of Freedom,Fry, Not big enough. We need something that can take out an entire army. Something you could commit a war crime with--
A Taste of Freedom,Bender, Wow! [He shoots the crossbow through his nose hole.] Ow!
A Taste of Freedom,Ambassador Mervin," Earth slaves, behold the fruit of your labours  The Mobile Oppression Palace."
A Taste of Freedom,Bender, Neat!
A Taste of Freedom,Ambassador Mervin," I don't need to tell you that occupation forces are expensive. But with the Mobile Oppression Palace, a few dignitaries can oppress your entire planet for pennies a day. [On a balcony the dignitaries laugh and sneer.] Warships, dismissed!"
A Taste of Freedom,Old Man Waterfall," Do your worst, you sea devils! I'll make my stand with Ol' Freebie. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! [The Palace crushes him with a giant claw. Old Man Waterfall screams from under the claw.] My spirit!"
A Taste of Freedom,Frieda Waterfall," Great Grandpa, no! [She shakes her fist at the Decapodians.] Another victim of the mano-centric male-ocracy."
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg," Ambassador Mervin, you killed my lawyer."
A Taste of Freedom,Ambassador Mervin, You're welcome.
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg, He defended my freedom when no one else would. He was a good and honourable man.
A Taste of Freedom,Old Man Waterfall, I request a Satanic funeral.
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg, Is it possible that all this slavery and oppression is shmutzing up our freedom lesson?
A Taste of Freedom,Ambassador Mervin," Ah, take a pill, Zoidberg. [shouting] Begin again with the crushing!"
A Taste of Freedom,Fry," You haven't won yet, Mervin! You didn't expect us to even go to a museum, much less steal this ancient heat-seeking missile."
A Taste of Freedom,Ambassador Mervin, I don't even know you.
A Taste of Freedom,Decapodian Woman," Oh, it's gonna make such a mess!"
A Taste of Freedom,Ambassador Mervin," This is your secret plan? Meh! Heat-seeking missiles are useless against the Mobile Oppression Palace. All Decapodian technology is cold-blooded, like us!"
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg, All eyes on Zoidberg! [Old Man Waterfall's hand pops off his arm but still clutches the flagpole.] Ew!
A Taste of Freedom,Bender," Hey, I need that to smoke!"
A Taste of Freedom,Fry," Zoidberg, how could you? I used to think you were cool."
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg," Wait! People of Earth, listen. Yes, I'm desecrating a flag. But to preserve the freedom it represents!"
A Taste of Freedom,Leela," Zoidberg, you set us free! I feel like I could stand to hug you! I can't, but you know what I'm trying to say."
A Taste of Freedom,Crowd, [chanting] Zoidberg! Zoidberg! Zoidberg!
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg," Ah, if only they appreciated freedom this much on my home planet. Wait a second! They do! Because this is my home planet."
A Taste of Freedom,Nixon," And now, to raise this beautiful new flag, a red lobster that won't ruin your dinner, Dr. John Zoidberg!"
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg," You're a nice man, Nixon."
A Taste of Freedom,Scoop Chang," Dr. Zoidberg, how's about you take a bite of the flag for tomorrow's papers?"
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg," Oh, I couldn't."
A Taste of Freedom,Nixon," No, no, no, go ahead. You've earned it!"
A Taste of Freedom,Zoidberg," Well, maybe just a taste. [He takes a bite and cameras flash.] Mmm! Now that's a grand, old flag! [The crowd cheers and Zoidberg raises the flag.] I wonder what the Shroud of Turin tastes like."
A Taste of Freedom,,
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," I can't take it anymore! They've been at it for hours! [He bangs on the wall.] (shouting) Give it a rest, you two!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Robot, [shouting] Sorry!
A Fishful of Dollars,Teacher," Good morning, class. I trust you've all prepared for today's final exam."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," Uh, excuse me? I missed a few lectures. Uh, what subject is this?"
A Fishful of Dollars,Teacher, Ancient Egyptian algebra.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, What a nightmare!
A Fishful of Dollars,Teacher," Mister Fry, are those your underpants? [Fry looks down and sees he is wearing only his briefs. He stands up and the whole class laughs and points. He gasps.] Young man, I think it's time you learned a lesson about Lightspeed brand briefs."
A Fishful of Dollars,Announcer," [voice-over] Lightspeed fits today's active lifestyle. Whether you're on the job ... [Fry suddenly appears in a company meeting wearing just Lightspeeds.] ... or having fun. [He sits with a woman on a bed.] Lightspeed briefs, style and comfort for the discriminating crotch."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, What a weird dream! I'll never get back to sleep.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, So you're telling me they broadcast commercials into people's dreams?
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela, Of course.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," But, how is that possible?"
A Fishful of Dollars,Farnsworth," It's very simple. The ad gets into your brain just like this liquid gets into this egg. [He holds up an egg and injects it with liquid. The egg explodes, covering him and Leela in yolk.] Although, in reality, it's not liquid, but gamma radiation."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, That's awful. It's like brainwashing.
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela, Didn't you have ads in the 20th century?
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," Well, sure, but not in our dreams. Only on TV and radio. And in magazines and movies and at ball games, on buses and milk cartons and T-shirts and bananas and written on the sky. But not in dreams. No, sir-ee!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Bender," Quit squawking, flesh wad. Nobody's forcing you to buy anything."
A Fishful of Dollars,Amy," Yeah. I mean we all have commercials in our dreams but you don't see us running off to buy brand-name merchandise at low, low prices."
A Fishful of Dollars,Perfume saleswoman, Hi! Care to sample the latest fragrance from Calvin Clone?
A Fishful of Dollars,Amy, No thanks.
A Fishful of Dollars,Perfume saleswoman," And you, sir?"
A Fishful of Dollars,Bender, No thanks. I--
A Fishful of Dollars,Cosmetologist, What a lovely face. We just need to draw attention away from the eye area.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, Cool. [He walks over to a salesman.] Can I try these on before I buy them?
A Fishful of Dollars,Salesman, I'm afraid I can't let you open the package. But you can try on the demo pair.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," Ooh! Ho, ho, ho!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Amy," Hey, Bender! Great new sweater."
A Fishful of Dollars,Bender, New? What sweater? I came in with it. I don't know you people!
A Fishful of Dollars,Salesman," $30, please."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, $30? I can't afford that. Unless... [He pulls out his wallet.] Do you take Visa?
A Fishful of Dollars,Salesman, Visa hasn't existed for 500 years.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, American Express?
A Fishful of Dollars,Salesman, 600 years.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, Discover card?
A Fishful of Dollars,Salesman, Sorry we don't take Discover.
A Fishful of Dollars,Amy, Hey! You're springing for Lightspeed? Pretty ritzy!
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," No, I can't afford them. Being poor sucks. What kind of world is this where they advertise things not everybody can afford?"
A Fishful of Dollars,Amy, Quiet. There's an ad coming on.
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," [on screen] Hello, shoppers. It's me, Mom!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, Hey who's the rocker jockey?
A Fishful of Dollars,Amy, Guh! It's Mom. The world's most huggable industrialist.
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," [on screen] Call me old-fashioned, but when my robot starts to squeak like an old screen door, well, that's when I reach for a can of Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil."
A Fishful of Dollars,Bender," Mmm, tasty!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom, [on screen] And remember  Mom's oil is made with 10% more love than the next leading brand!
A Fishful of Dollars,Announcer," [voice-over; on screen] ""Mom"", ""love"" and ""screen door"" are registered trademarks of Momcorp."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," Hey, Bender. Sounds like you could use a little of that oil."
A Fishful of Dollars,Bender, I'm boned.
A Fishful of Dollars,Smitty," Freeze, scuzzbot!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Bender," Uh, there's obviously been some sort of a mistake here. [More tins fall out.] I'm sure there's-- [More tins fall out.] I say I'm sure there's-- [Even more tins fall out.] That is, I'm sure there's ... a very ... reasonable--"
A Fishful of Dollars,Amy, Do we have enough money to pay Bender's fine?
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," [counting] 78, 79, 79.50. Crud! We're 50 cents short."
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela, I'd love to chip in but Bender stole my wallet.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," Hey, that's my old bank. Maybe my account's still open."
A Fishful of Dollars,Teller," Hmm. We don't seem to have your retina scan, your fingerprint or your colonic map on file."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," Yeah, well, I did open the account over a thousand years ago. What about my ATM card?"
A Fishful of Dollars,Teller, Do you still remember your PIN number?
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza."
A Fishful of Dollars,Teller," OK, you had a balance of 93 cents..."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, Alright!
A Fishful of Dollars,Teller," And at an average of two-and-a-quarter percent interest over a period of 1000 years, that comes to ... $4.3 billion."
A Fishful of Dollars,Hermes, To Fry.
A Fishful of Dollars,Amy, Cheers!
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela," I know Fry's rich, but do we really have to wear these top hats?"
A Fishful of Dollars,Bender," Maybe you don't understand just how rich he is. In fact, I think I'd better put on a monocle."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, Pizza dinner on me! [The others cheer.] Just keep the tab under $50 million.
A Fishful of Dollars,Robot Chef, Yo! [He whistles.] I haven't got all day. What kind of pizza yous guys want?
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," Uh, yeah. We'll have one with everything but anchovies and one with my all time favourite topping, anchovies!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Robot Chef," [mechanical voice] Invalid selection. (normal voice) Yo, what are you talking about?"
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, Anchovies? You know? Those little headless fish?
A Fishful of Dollars,Robot Chef, [mechanical voice] Does not compute. Does not compute.
A Fishful of Dollars,Farnsworth," I'm sorry, Fry, but the anchovy has been extinct since the 2200's."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, What?
A Fishful of Dollars,Farnsworth," Oh, my, yes. Fished to death. Just about the time your people arrived on Earth wasn't it, Zoidberg?"
A Fishful of Dollars,Zoidberg, [defensively] I'm not on trial here.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," So none of you has ever had anchovies? Oh, man! You don't know what you're missing. They were all salty and oily and they melted in your mouth and--"
A Fishful of Dollars,Zoidberg," Stop! Stop! I admit it! My people ate them all! We kept saying ""One more can't hurt"" and then they were gone. We're sorry!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, I just wish I could've showed you guys how great they were. I may be rich but I still can't buy back all the things I miss from the 20th century.
A Fishful of Dollars,Bender, Maybe you're forgetting just how rich you are. [He puts his monocle back on.] Huh? Huh?
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, So? What do you think?
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela," I know you spent a lot of money on this place, Fry, but it's awfully primitive. [She stamps the floorboards.] The floors are made of such hard wood."
A Fishful of Dollars,Bender, Hey! Get a load of this pathetic 20th century TV!
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, What's wrong with it?
A Fishful of Dollars,Bender," Well, aside from causing eye cancer, these things had a lousy low-definition picture."
A Fishful of Dollars,Amy, That's true. On a TV like this I bet you couldn't even make out my obscene tattoo.
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela, That's cute!
A Fishful of Dollars,Auctioneer, Sold!
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, Yes!
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela," I just don't get it. Who was this Ted Danson, and why would you pay $10,000 for his skeleton?"
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, I have an idea for a sitcom.
A Fishful of Dollars,Bender," Ah, leave him alone, Leela. So he's going a little wacko with his money. It's OK."
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela, You're just saying that because he bought you that antique robot toy.
A Fishful of Dollars,Bender," Yeah, it is cute."
A Fishful of Dollars,Auctioneer," Now, our final item  This unopened can of Angry Norwegian brand anchovies circa 1997."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, Anchovies?
A Fishful of Dollars,Auctioneer," The last known can in existence guaranteed fresh and edible. Do I hear $10,000?"
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," 15,000!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Man, 20!
A Fishful of Dollars,Decapodian Woman," 30! No, 40!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," 50,000!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela, Are you crazy? It's a can of old fish.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, Don't tell me how to spend my money.
A Fishful of Dollars,Auctioneer," 50 going once, twice--"
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," 75,000."
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela," Oh, my God! It's Mom! I've never seen her in person before."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," 100,000."
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela," Fry, you can't bid against Mom; she's the richest, most powerful person in the world. And she's so adorable."
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," Well, I suppose I could go as high as ... 300,000."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, 500!
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," Oh, mercy be. A million."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, Two.
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom, Six.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, 14!
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," I can see the nice young man really wants those little fish. Nevertheless, I'll bid 23 million."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, One jillion dollars.
A Fishful of Dollars,Auctioneer," Sir, that's not a number."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," Oh. In that case, 50 million."
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," Well, boys, your old mother knows when she's been beat. [She turns to Fry.] You win, young man. I tip my bonnet to you."
A Fishful of Dollars,Bidder #1, Isn't she adorable?
A Fishful of Dollars,Bidder #2, Isn't she sweet?
A Fishful of Dollars,Auctioneer, What a class act! Sold! To the gentleman who bought every item in today's auction.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, Now for some good old 20th century TV.
A Fishful of Dollars,Announcer, [voice-over; on TV] Do you remember a time when chocolate chip cookies came fresh from the oven? Petridge Farm remembers.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," Ah, those were the days."
A Fishful of Dollars,Announcer, [voice-over; on TV] Do you remember a time when women couldn't vote and certain folk weren't allowed on golf courses? Petridge Farm remembers.
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela, [from outside] Fry? Are you there?
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, Eh?
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela, You haven't been to work in three days. What have you been doing?
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," I've been sitting right here. I picked up my life exactly where I left off a thousand years ago. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's eight o'clock. Time to get biz-ay!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela, You can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, I could if you hadn't turned on the lights and shut off the stereo.
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela," Fry, this isn't healthy. You're living in the past."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, I'm rich! I can live whenever I want.
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela, But we're your friends and we live here in the year 3000.
A Fishful of Dollars,Bender, Yeah! Now are you gonna come to the squid fights with us or sit here wallowing in your prehistoric junk?
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," Junk? Maybe you can't understand this, but I've finally found what I need to be happy and it's not friends, it's things."
A Fishful of Dollars,Bender, [sadly] I'm a thing.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, Just leave me alone.
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela," Fry, please-- [Fry slams the door and Leela knocks.] (from outside) My ponytail's caught in the door."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," I don't need them. Not when I have my antique videos, my bucket of fossilised KFC and 50 million dollars worth of anchovies."
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," Mercy me, what a day."
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," Could you shut the door, Igner, dear? I think I feel a draught coming on. [Igner closes the door and Mom's torso open up, revealing it to be just a body suit. A thinner but just as old a woman jumps out.] Holy crap, that bastard's itchy! [She snaps her fingers.] Walt! Cream soda!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Walt," Right away, mother. Larry, get your mother a cream soda."
A Fishful of Dollars,Larry," But, Mom said--"
A Fishful of Dollars,Walt, You heard me.
A Fishful of Dollars,Igner," What's wrong, Mommy?"
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," It's those damned anchovies. That dirtbag, Fry, must know their secret. And I won't rest until I get my hands on them. No one messes with Mom!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Walt," Quiet, you!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," As you boys know, one of the cornerstones of my empire is Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil. Think of it  10 billion robots, each one needing an oil change every 3000 miles. You don't have to do the math to know that's a buttload of oil."
A Fishful of Dollars,Igner, Can I wear your fat suit?
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," [shouting] No, Igner, put that down!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Walt, What does this have to do with the anchovies?
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom, I'm getting to the freaking anchovies. [She turns on a TV displaying an anchovy.] A single drop of the anchovies' natural oil would lubricate 10 robots permanently.
A Fishful of Dollars,Larry," Wow, it's a shame they went extinct."
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," [shouting] No, it isn't! Shut your filthy trap! [Walt slaps Larry.] (talking) Thank you, Walt. If anyone ever got a hold of anchovy DNA, they could chop out the oil-making gene, stick it in a bunch of Third-World kids and bam! Cheap effective robot oil. Enough to put dear, old Mom out of businness."
A Fishful of Dollars,Walt, My God! This Mr. Fry must be a mastermind of the highest order.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fred," [on TV] Esther, you ugly!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," We have only one option  We'll have to bankrupt Mr. Fry, so he'll be forced to sell the anchovies to us."
A Fishful of Dollars,Walt," Mother, you are one clever old skag!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom, And don't you forget it!
A Fishful of Dollars,Larry, But how are we supposed to get Fry's money out of the bank?
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," That part will be easy, thanks to the nice people at Mom's Old Fashioned Video Surveillance Unit."
A Fishful of Dollars,Teller, [on TV] Do you still remember your PIN number?
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," [on TV] Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza. [The tape rewinds.] It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda--"
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom, You know what needs to be done.
A Fishful of Dollars,Larry, What?
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," [shouting] Get his PIN number, you idiots! [She zips up her fat suit.] (talking) Now I'm off to some charity BS for knocked-up teenage sluts."
A Fishful of Dollars,Walt," [from outside] Mr. Fry, it's those three plumbers you called for."
A Fishful of Dollars,Larry, [from outside] We're here to tighten your drain.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, I didn't order any--
A Fishful of Dollars,Walt, Quick! Give him the tranquilliser.
A Fishful of Dollars,Larry, That's a good boy.
A Fishful of Dollars,Walt," Wake up, Mr. Fry."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, Where am I?
A Fishful of Dollars,Walt," You're in the good old year 2000, working here at Panucci's Pizza. You fell asleep on the job."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, That sounds like me but I thought I got frozen. Wasn't I in the future?
A Fishful of Dollars,Walt," No, you only ""dreamed"" you were in the year 3000."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," So I'm really back? That's exactly what I wanted, I guess. Who are you?"
A Fishful of Dollars,Walt, I'm Mr. Panucci.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, You are? Did you grow a moustache since last night?
A Fishful of Dollars,Walt," No. Now go work the currency register, I think I hear a customer coming. [No one enters.] I said, ""I think I hear a customer coming""!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Anderson," Hurry up, please. I wanna get back to the Head Museum."
A Fishful of Dollars,Larry," Don't worry, Miss Anderson, this won't take long. Now, your motivation is you're back in the year 2000 and your head's still on your body, and you want a cheese pizza."
A Fishful of Dollars,Anderson, OK. But I'm only doing this so people will take my head seriously as an actress.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," Hey, look! Anchovies!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Walt," Of course. They're not extinct yet. And if you need further proof that this is really a thousand years ago, well, here's contemporary actress, Pamela Anderson!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, Ooh!
A Fishful of Dollars,Anderson," Hello, Fry. Remember me from Baywatch  The Movie?"
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, Uh...
A Fishful of Dollars,Anderson, It was the first movie to be shot entirely in slow-motion.
A Fishful of Dollars,Walt, [whispering] It hasn't been made yet.
A Fishful of Dollars,Anderson, [whispering] Then he doesn't know I won the Oscar?
A Fishful of Dollars,Walt, Nope.
A Fishful of Dollars,Anderson, Crap!
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, Wait. You're Pamela Anderson! Cool! What can I get you?
A Fishful of Dollars,Anderson," Oh, I'll have a cheese pizza and a large ... uh ... line?"
A Fishful of Dollars,Larry, [whispering] Soda!
A Fishful of Dollars,Anderson," Oh, right! Cheese pizza and a large soda!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," Uh, cheese and a-- [Walt immediately picks up the boxed pizza and soda from under the counter.] That was quick!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Anderson, So. What do I owe you?
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, 10.77. Same as my PIN number.
A Fishful of Dollars,Igner, Hey! You don't get to laugh.
A Fishful of Dollars,Igner, Thanks a billion!
A Fishful of Dollars,Larry, More like 4.3 billion!
A Fishful of Dollars,Igner, Ow!
A Fishful of Dollars,Larry, Ow!
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," Oh, I had a nightmare I was in the year 2000 and you guys never existed. I'm so glad I'm awake now and you're really here."
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela, Since when do you care about us?
A Fishful of Dollars,Bender, We thought you only cared about cans of anchovies and stuffy old songs about the buttocks.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," No, that's not true!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela, Goodbye-ee!
A Fishful of Dollars,Bender, Whee!
A Fishful of Dollars,Announcer, [voice-over] This dream brought to you by Lightspeed briefs.
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," Bender! Leela! Don't leave me. Wait a minute! Hey, buddy, what year is this?"
A Fishful of Dollars,Repo-bot," Uh, 3000."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, 3000? Yes! I'm still in the future! Life is wonderful! [He sees what the repo-bot is carrying.] Wait! What are you doing with my stuff?
A Fishful of Dollars,Repo-bot," Uh, cheque bounced. We're taking it all back."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," Oh, no! My ATM card! My secret PIN number -- 1077. I've got nothing left. Except..."
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela, You're Fry's relative. Do you have any idea how he got so crazy?
A Fishful of Dollars,Farnsworth," Uh, wha? Oh, yes! They say madness runs in our family. Some even call me mad! And why? Because I dared to dream of my own race of atomic monsters. Atomic supermen with octagonal-shaped bodies that suck blood out of..."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, Leela! Bender! I missed you so much!
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela, You did? What happened?
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, I was robbed. They got everything except these.
A Fishful of Dollars,Bender, Who did?
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," Hello, Fry."
A Fishful of Dollars,Leela, It's Mom!
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," I felt terrible when I heard about your money troubles and I thought maybe I could help out a sweet, young man by buying his anchovies."
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, Sorry. But the anchovies aren't for sale.
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," What? Listen, you little bastard. I control the robot oil business and I won't let you ruin me. How much do you want?"
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," You might as well put that chequebook away, because I've discovered something even more important  My friends. And they aren't worth even a penny to me. [Bender and Leela look at each other.] That's why these anchovies are going on a pizza, so I can share the food I love with the people I like."
A Fishful of Dollars,Mom," Holy hell! You're going to eat them? Oh, well. Just make sure you eat them all, you're a growing boy. Toodle-oo! [She walks out.] Dumb ass!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, What a nice lady!
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," OK, my friends. Get ready for the most delicious extinct animal you've ever tasted."
A Fishful of Dollars,Amy," I don't know, I've had cow. [The staff tuck in. Everyone except Fry spits out their pizza.] Ew! Gross!"
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry," Ah, no one likes them at first but they'll grow on you."
A Fishful of Dollars,Zoidberg, That stench. That heavenly stench! [He gobbles up the rest of the pizza.] More!
A Fishful of Dollars,Fry, There aren't any more. And there never will be.
A Fishful of Dollars,Zoidberg, More! More! More! More!
A Fishful of Dollars,,
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,John DiMaggio," Wooo! [imitates DJ scratching] Two, three! [beatboxes over the theme song]"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth," Oh, my."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," Here we go, y'all!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Zoidberg, Zoidberg...Zoidberg...Z-Z-Z-Z-Zoidberg. [he babbles rhymthically]
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, This is a story about all my friends!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth, Fry?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Fry, Unh!!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth, Fry?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Announcer, [voice-over; on TV] Previously on All My Circuits...
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Antonio," [crying; on TV] I'm sorry, Father. But, somewhere along the way, I forgot how to be your son."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon," [on TV] Why, Antonio?"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Antonio, [crying; on TV] Because ... I have amnesia!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Monique, [on TV] Calculon? But I thought you were--
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon, [on TV] Egyptian?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Monique," [on TV] Before I kill you, I must ask you one question  Who am I? For I have ... amnesia!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon, [on TV] Let me get this straight  Does anyone here not have amnesia?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Monique, [on TV] Not sure.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Human Friend, [on TV] I 'unno.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cubert, This show is awesome! When I grow up I'm gonna have so much amnesia!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight," Me too. I mean, I have it now, but I forgot."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cubert," Well, mine's louder!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," Cram a ham in it, you twerps! [He throws his beer bottle at them, it misses and hits Fry, who squeals.] Sorry!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Fry," Nah, I had it coming."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon," [on TV] Welcome, swingers. Pull up a groove and get fabulous."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Monique," [on TV] Nude rocks bands, big piles of what I assume is talcum powder. It's quite a birthday party, Calculon."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cubert, Cool! I'm gonna have a fabulatious birthday party just like Calculon!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight," Oh, yeah? Well I'm gonna show up looking good, just like Monique."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Leela, Do you two have to imitate everything you see on TV?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cubert," Um, we're 12. So, yes."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight," Hold up, Cubert. You're a clone of the Professor. Do clones even have birthdays?"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cubert," Um, duh!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight," ""Duh"" what?"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cubert, Dad? Do I have a birthday?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth," Hmm. You didn't have a birth so, technically, no. [Cubert sighs. Farnsworth puts his hand on his shoulder.] Oh, don't feel bad. We can celebrate the day I extracted you from the cloning tank, or the day I scraped your DNA from that growth on my back."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cubert, Ooh! That one!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth," Ah, yes. It was 13 years ago next week. [He takes something out of his lab coat.] I used this very fork."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Hermes," Aw, well isn't that-- Ew!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight, Hey! Next week'll be my birthday too.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Hermes, That's true. If only there were a way to have one party for both of you here at the office then write it off as a business expense. Wait! I thought of a way! The way I just said!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cubert, Yeah!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight," Way to go, Pops!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, [shouting; from lounge] Something's happening on television.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon," [on TV] Oh, Monique, why did we wait so many years to bathe in champagne?"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Antonio," [on TV] Father, I've discovered the shocking secret mother has kept from you for 200 years."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Monique, [on TV] No! No!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Antonio," [on TV] Brace yourself. For when I speak these words, you may well suffer an attack of explosive amnesia. For you see, the horrible secret is--"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, Whoever's directing this is a master of suspense!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Sal, He's busteds. Let's get hims outta heres.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Announcer," [voice-over; on TV] We now join America's most popular show already in progress, Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Fry, This show's been going downhill since season three.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Zoidberg," Look who's here, everyone! It's Zoidberg, the lovable tramp!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Leela, Since when are you performing at children's parties?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Zoidberg," Performing? What? Please, if someone could spare me money to buy shoes--"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight, This party pukes.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cubert, Yeah! The guests were supposed to be here three hours ago.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth," Well, that doesn't mean that no one is coming or that you two are total losers. Who gave you that idea?"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight, Alright! They must have all come as a group.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cubert," Welcome, swingers! Pull up a groove and get fabulous."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Tinny Tim," Good day, fellows. Someone dumped this invitation in my begging cup. Happy growth-scraping day to all!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Hermes, Fire 'em all.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth, Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, [gasping] Guys! Guys! Something's happening on television again.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Morbo," [on TV] Welcome to Entertainment And Earth Invasion Tonite. Across the galaxy, my people are completing the mighty space fleet that will exterminate the human race! But first, this news from Tinseltown."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Linda," [on TV] Following Antonio Calculon Jr.'s breakdown on the set, the popular TV show All My Circuits will hold an open casting call for child robots to replace him."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," An open casting call for child robots? Tinny Tim, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Tinny Tim," What's that, sir?"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," That I, Bender, am perfect for the role!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Tinny Tim," You raised my hopes and dashed them quite expertly, sir. [He raises his crutch.] Bravo!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Leela," Bender, your swarthy Latin charm will only get you so far. There's a lot of famous child acting units here."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Fry, Look! There's Macaulay Culkon.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Leela, He's just not cute since he got puberty installed.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Fry, Pst. There's that robot child actor who grew up and robbed a convenience store!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Leela, And there's that robot child actor who grew up and became a convenience store!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Robber-bot," Lottery ticket, please."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Casting Director, We're ready for the first audition. [She looks at her clipboard.] [reading] Emotitron Jr.?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Mombot," Hold on, precious. Let's make you look nice for the lady. [She smoothes his ""hair"" down and opens his chest cabinet, revealing wires.] What's this? [She snaps the wires out.] What did I tell you? [She whips him with every word.] No more hanging wires!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Casting Director," In this scene, you've just found out your real father is Calculon's fourth evil identical septuplet, Sleazy Martinez. OK ... take us there!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Emotitron Jr.," Now that I know the truth, Father, I must ride south and join the robo-bandidos at Veracruz."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, [shouting; from outside] Awful! Boo! This kid sucks! We want Bender! Boo!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon," Well, I thought he was good but the audience seems to have turned on him."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Casting Director, But I don't think--
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon, Next!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Macaulay Culkon," --At Veracruz. So, if you'll kindly hand me my poncho--"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, [shouting; from outside] Boo! Bring on Bender! Boo! Bender's the greatest!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon," Sorry, kid. You're flailing up there. [He screams and runs out.] 90 actors and they all got boo-ed. I just wish we could get this Bender I keep hearing about. They say he's the greatest."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Casting Director," Well, there is a robot named Bender here but he's much too old for--"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon, Send him in forthwith!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, [shouting] Boo! Not as good as Bender! Boo!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Casting Director, Mr. Bender?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Casting Director, Have you ever been on TV before?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," Once, when I took those hostages."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon, I saw that! You were good. Let's hear you audition.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," Bandidos, eh? Aw, this is great! 'Cause I happen to have a flawless Spanish accent! [He clears his throat.] [bad Spanish accent] I will see. Adios Padre! Come, Jesus, my faithful ... chee-huey-hua. Tonight we eat ... gee-wack-a-mole by the El Rio!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon, That was so terrible I think you gave me cancer! I don't care how popular you are. You will never work on my show!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Fry," [shouting; from outside] Yay, Bender!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Leela, [shouting; from outside] We demand Bender!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon," However, you've got the job. Welcome aboard, son!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, Father-o!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon," Bender, I'd like you to meet our director ... [He pulls a man with a ponytail and wearing a blernsball cap in front of him.] ... whose name I never learned."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, Yo! I read the script and I think it would help my character's motivation if he was on fire.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Director," Uh, don't worry about the script, baby. We re-wrote your part to better suit your acting abilities."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, So now my character has a British accent?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Director," No, now your character's in a coma. Get in bed and don't move. [He moves off the set behind the cameras. Bender grumbles and hops onto the bed and lies down.] And ... action!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, [muttering] Stupid dumb coma ... coulda been British.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon," Alas that mine only son should sink into an irreversible, permanent ... coma."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, [quietly] Permanent? That's completely out of character for Antonio. I'm gettin' up.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon, Curse the tragic wildebeest accident that--
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," Hey, everyone! Antonio here, but you can call me ""Bender""! I got ants in my butt and I needs to strut. [He stands up on the bed and starts dancing.] C'mon, baby! [He hums and takes a cigar out of his chest cabinet and takes a few puffs then follows with a gulp of beer.] Come on!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon, I'm not familiar with the type of thing I'm seeing.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," Bite my shiny metal ass! [He carries on dancing.] Ooh, yeah! C'mon, baby! Come on! Yeah!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Director, [shouting] Cut! [He walks onto the set.] That's the worst coma acting I've ever seen. We'll have to shoot it again.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon," No! No, no, no. I don't do two takes."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Director, But this guy was--
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon, Amateurs like you do two takes. I do one take. Print it. I'll be in my three-storey trailer.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," [on TV] Bite my shiny metal ass! [He starts dancing.] Ooh, yeah! C'mon, baby! Come on! Yeah!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," Now that's hospital dancing. [He nudges Calculon.] Pretty good, eh, Calcky?"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon, Good? I've seen better acting from extras in Godzilla movies. [On the screen Bender whistles nonchalantly as he empties a chest of drawers.] I don't even remember shooting this scene.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Director, We didn't. That's security camera footage from your dressing room.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon, He stole the scene and my money? That's it! I demand you fire this felonious ham!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Director, The network Execubots are coming!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon," Oh, dear God!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Betabot, Presenting the president of the network.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Network President," Greetings, gentlemen. You already know my Execubots  Executive Alpha, programmed to like things it has seen before."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Alphabot," Hey, hey, hey."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Network President," Executive Beta, programmed to roll dice to determine the fall schedule."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Betabot, More reality shows.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Network President," And Executive Gamma, programmed to underestimate middle America."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Gammabot, It's funny but is it going to get them off their tractors?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Network President," Now, who put this obnoxious, dancing robot on my network?"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Director," We were about to fire him, sir."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Network President," Silence, hack! We've been monitoring our Nielsen families carefully. And during the 12 seconds Bender was on screen, viewer eyeball focus was up 90%."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon," But, sir, children watch this show. Bender's no role model, he's a filth monger!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Network President," At our network, we love filth! Filthy rich, that is! Being filthy rich, that is! [He laughs and signals fizzle towards the Execubots, making them all laugh with him.] ""Bite my shiny metal ass"" could be a catchphrase."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Alphabot, 80% likely.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Gammabot, It will play in Peoria.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Betabot, Gameshows are back.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Network President," We need this edgy, sweeps-ready robot on our network. Bender? Can you continue to drink, smoke and steal things on TV?"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," Yes, I can."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Tinny Tim, Yeah! Shooting!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight, Alright!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight, Yo! Check out what I jacked from my dad.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cubert, A cigar!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Tinny Tim, Ripping!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight, Look! I'm Bender!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Hermes, Ras H. Tafari! What's goin' on here?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth, The ruffians smoked one of your cigars.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Hermes, That's not a cigar. Uh ... and it's not mine!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cubert," Hey, Dad! Bite my shiny metal ass!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth, What? Such an act would be most uncomfortable for both of us! Where did you learn such language?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Tinny Tim," From Bender, my good jerkwad."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Hermes," Bender, eh? That guy's really startin' to twist my dreads."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," OK, OK, OK. Get ready for this part."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Zoidberg," Quiet, robot! Bender's on TV."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Monique," [on TV] Oh, Calculon, it's so good to get away from the city and that beastly, yet intriguing, Bender."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," [on TV] Try this, kids at home!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Linda, [on TV] Is television sensation Bender a bad role model for Earth children?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, That's crazy!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Linda," [on TV] A new protest group, Fathers Against Rude Television, says ""Hell, yes!"""
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Fry, Pft! What kind of bozos would start a Bender protest group?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. Hermes and I have started a Bender protest group."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Zoidberg, That was uncanny.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Hermes, Fathers Against Rude Television don't want our kids watching Bender's high-definition filth.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth, And for what? Some kind of cheap laugh? That's not what F-A-R-T is all about.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Hermes," No, sir! Not us FARTers."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't censor me just 'cause I'm an obscenely bad role model."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Leela," As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree with Bender. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Fry, Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cubert," Our dads are all pumped up on dork-osterone. We're just trying to be cool, like Bender."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight," Yeah, and it's not even working. Smoking and drinking make us barf."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Tinny Tim, Gentle jerkwads. I know how to emulate Bender without barfing. We could commit a burglary.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight," Hey, yeah!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cubert, Bender loves to burgle!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight," Hold up, though. Who could we rob? We don't even know anyone with cool stuff."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cubert, Duh! We know someone who runs on pure cool fuel  Bender!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight, Whoa!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Tinny Tim, We'll rob Bender!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight, TV gave us the idea.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," [voice-over] You're watching Futurama, the show that does not advocate the cool crime of robbery."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cubert, OK. It's crime time.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Fry," Hey, Bender. [Cubert walks past with a Bender portrait.] Hey, Bender. [Dwight struggles with a safe marked ""Bender's Loot"".] Hey, Bender. [The phone rings. Fry picks up.] Hey, Bender."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth, What's going on in here? [The music stops. Hermes rubs some dirt off Farnsworth's glasses and Farnsworth straightens them.] Oh. Now I'm really outraged.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Hermes," Where did you requisition this party? And Zoidberg, what are you doing here?"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Zoidberg, I'm networking. Let me give you my card.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cubert," Relax, Dad. We just invited a few friends over."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth, Hmm. There's something wrong with your story but I can't put my finger on it. [He gasps.] Of course! You don't have friends!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Hermes, Yeah. Why do these popular kids consider you cool all of a sudden?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight," Um ... we're just cool, is all!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth," Balderdash! I'll be the judge of who's cool, using the cool-o-meter!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cool-o-Meter," Oh, yeah!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth, Good Lord! I'm getting a reading of over 40 mega-Fonzies.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Hermes, Everybody out!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Zoidberg," So, do you guys know about anything else going on, because I'm totally still ready to party."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Hermes, There's enough cool stuff here to furnish a happenin' pad. Where did it all come from?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Tinny Tim," Don't tell, comrades. All for one and one for all!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight, We stole it!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Tinny Tim," Oh, crumb!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, What? What's going on?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth, I'll tell you what. Our boys have taken up stealing! One of the worst and coolest of crimes.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Hermes," And all from watching you on TV, you cool jerk."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," Hey, lay off me. TV would stink if everyone on it was a positive role model. Bender is about entertainment, baby! You can't hold me responsible for what kids do when-- Hey! This is my stuff they stole! [He takes Playbot from Tinny Tim.] That's the last straw! Bender should not be allowed on television!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, Bender must be stopped. I've gone too far. Who does that guy think I am? [The dads cheer.] Come on! We're gonna march all the way to Hollywood and make them stop forcing their filthy me down our throats!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,FART Mob, [chanting] Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, This mob's with me.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Security Guard, Go ahead.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,FART Mob," [chanting] Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with-- [They see a red light and a ""Quiet When Red Light Is On"" sign outside the Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad soundstage and stop chanting. The light goes off and they carry on.] Bender! Down with Bender!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon," As a doctor and captain of this hospital ship, I now pronounce you man and wife with six months to live."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth," Listen up, Hollywood. We're an exciting, new mob."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, Yeah!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Hermes, You'd better believe it!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon, Great Shatner's ghost!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, We demand that all TV's be equipped with a B-Chip that blocks Bender from appearing on the screen.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth, Booya!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Network President," I'm afraid the answer is a gritty, in-your-face no."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, Then I quit.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Network President," Then you don't quit. [His CD-ROM drive opens and one of the Execubots puts a gun in it and connects it to him.] I think you'll be finishing the scene now, Mr. Bender. And don't skimp on the nasty."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth, There'll be no further nasty. [He takes a laser out of his lab coat.] We still have the option of resorting to violence.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Hermes, What makes you think that'll work?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth, I saw it on TV in that episode where Bender shot Calculon. How cool was that?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," Ooh, yeah! C'mon--"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth, Quit the show!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Network President, Do the scene.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth, I'm a cold-blooded punk!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Network President, I once put a laugh track on a sitcom that had no jokes in it.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," Hey, look! The prop guy has a lamp!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Network President, Really?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth, Wha?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, Aha!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth, I was using that!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," Listen up, 'cause I've got a climactic speech! You, cameraman, keep the camera rolling. You, director, gimmie my motivation."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Director, You're angry.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," Perfect. [He turns to the camera.] Viewers of the world, do smoking and drinking on TV really make me cool? Of course they do. [He blows some cigar smoke.] How 'bout committing crimes and violence? Again, the answer is ""yes"". But do we really want our kids exposed to that kind of trash on TV? I say absolutely not! [He accidentally fires Farnsworth's laser and a laser bolt flies over Farnsworth's head, narrowly missing him. Bender clears his throat.] Uh ... on the other hand, most, perhaps all the blame, rests with the parents. That's right, you! [He points his firearms at the FART mob and they gasp and duck.] And so I ask you this one question  Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Hermes, [ashamed] We're just so busy.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, Well make time.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Director, And ... cut!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Calculon, Good enough. Splice in some reaction shots of me and shove it on the air.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender," [on TV]   Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Hermes," Well, I'd say we all learned a valuable lesson about TV there."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cubert, What was it?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth," Uh ... that we should all take TV a little less seriously. And more importantly, turn it off once in a while."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Fry," Hear, hear!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Leela, Yeah!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, Damn right!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight," So, should we turn it off now?"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth," Well, uh, that depends what's on."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Fry, Nothing good.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth," Ah, let's just keep watching."
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, [singing] TV party tonight!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth, Wha?
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, [singing] TV party tonight!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth, Oh!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Fry, [singing] We've got nothing better to do.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Leela, [singing] Than watch TV and have a couple of brews!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Zoidberg, [singing] Don't wanna talk about anything else.
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Fry, [singing] We don't wanna know!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Farnsworth," [singing] We're dedicated, yes!"
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Hermes, [singing] To our favourite shows!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Cubert, All My Circuits
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Dwight, Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Amy, Scary Door!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Leela, Blernsday Night Blernsball!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,Bender, Futurama!
Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television,,
Jurassic Bark,Bender," For my next trick, notice I have nothing up my sleeves ... [He rolls his arms up.] ... and nothing in my head. [He takes his head off shows it to his ""audience"" and replaces it.] So if my lovely assistant will kindly supply me with an ordinary, non-fake pitcher of milk... [He rolls up a newspaper and pours the milk into it. He then unrolls the newspaper.] Behold, the milk has vanished! Exiled, perhaps, to another dimension!"
Jurassic Bark,Fry," Amazing! That's why they call you ""Bender the Magnificent""!"
Jurassic Bark,Bender," No, it isn't."
Jurassic Bark,Fry," Whoa! They discovered an intact, 20th century pizzeria, just like the one I used to work at."
Jurassic Bark,Bender," Interesting. No, wait, the other thing ... tedious."
Jurassic Bark,Fry, Let's go check it out. You can see how I lived before I met you.
Jurassic Bark,Bender, You lived before you met me?
Jurassic Bark,Fry, Sure. Lots of people did.
Jurassic Bark,Bender, Really?
Jurassic Bark,Bender," Truly, they were as gods who built this place!"
Jurassic Bark,Tour Guide," Next, we come to the splendidly-preserved wooden pizza paddle. [She presses a button and a robot chef bats a robot delivery boy with the paddle.] Scientists theorise it was used to gently discipline the delivery boy."
Jurassic Bark,Fry," Wait a second! This is Panucci's! I used to work in this exact pizzeria! [He grabs the paddle.] And for your information, lady, this was not just used to paddle my butt. It was also used to move pizzas and crush rats."
Jurassic Bark,Tour Guide," I don't know where you get your facts, sir, but I am a volunteer housewife with 45 minutes of orientation and a Harlequin romance about archaeologists."
Jurassic Bark,Fry," Don't wave your fancy degrees at me! I recognise all this stuff. [He walks over to a display case.] Petrified sausages, old Mr. Patelli. And that's--"
Jurassic Bark,Man, [on intercom] Yes?
Jurassic Bark,Fry, Pizza delivery for Mr. ... [He checks the note.] ... Seymour Asses.
Jurassic Bark,Man, [on intercom] There's no one by that name here ... or anywhere. I hope that in time you'll realise what an idiot you've been.
Jurassic Bark,Fry, I wouldn't count on that.
Jurassic Bark,Fry," Aw! Poor little guy. You look like you haven't eaten in a month. Here ... [He offers the dog a slice.] ... but if Mr. Panucci asks, your name is Seymour Asses. [The dog snaffles the slice.] I like you, Seymour. You're not constantly judging me like all the other dogs ... are you? Nah! We understand each other. [He hands Seymour another slice.] People think you're just a dumb mutt who smells bad, can't find a girlfriend and has a crummy job. But you're keepin' it real and you call no man ""Mister"". [He gets up and gets on his bike.] Well, goodbye. [He does the Vulcan salute.] Live long and prosper."
Jurassic Bark,Bender, Yuck! That's the least appetising calzone I've ever seen!
Jurassic Bark,Fry," No! That's my dog in there. It's an outrage, I say! [He grabs Bender by his foot and uses him to smash the display case. He takes Seymour and Bender hops around holding his foot, screaming in pain.] I'm taking him home and I'd like to see anyone try and stop me. [Two security guards grab him.] Uh-oh!"
Jurassic Bark,Bender," And then he was ejected by the guards. Needless to say, I was mortified."
Jurassic Bark,Fry, Well it's not right to make my dead pet an exhibit. That's like digging up Lassie and putting her on display in the Louvre.
Jurassic Bark,Amy, Lassie is on display in the Louvre.
Jurassic Bark,Fry, I know. I was deliberately describing a similar situation.
Jurassic Bark,Farnsworth, Why don't you try protesting? Like those native Martians; always whining that people don't treat their ancestor's bones with respect.
Jurassic Bark,Bender," Nah, protesting never works."
Jurassic Bark,Fry, You're right. [He gets up.] I'll give it a shot!
Jurassic Bark,Crowd, [chanting] What do you want?
Jurassic Bark,Fry, [into megaphone] Fry's dog!
Jurassic Bark,Crowd, [chanting] When do you want it?
Jurassic Bark,Fry, [into megaphone.] Fry's dog! [The crowd cheers.] I will now perform my people's native dance.
Jurassic Bark,Leela, It says this part of The Hustle implores the gods to grant a favour. Usually a Trans-AM.
Jurassic Bark,Fry," [singing] I'm walking on sunshine! Oh-oh-oh! [Seymour howls along with the tune.] I'm walking on sunshine! Oh-oh-oh! [He locks his bike up.] [talking] That a boy, Seymour! Right here waiting for me as always. Just like that huge mushroom in my shower."
Jurassic Bark,Panucci," Hey! There's our little mascot. [Seymour shakes himself.] Aw, you been swimming in the sewer again? [He rubs Seymour down with the pizza dough.] You rascal! [He ladles tomato sauce onto the dough. Some spills onto the floor.] Fry, cleanup!"
Jurassic Bark,Fry," Seymour, cleanup! [Seymour licks up the tomato sauce.] Good dog!"
Jurassic Bark,Panucci, That's a good Seymour!
Jurassic Bark,Boy, Yo! There's dog fur on my slice!
Jurassic Bark,Panucci," Nah, that's vermicelli! No fur in here!"
Jurassic Bark,Fry," He's so cute! He can do two things at one time  Eat and swim. Ooh, three things!"
Jurassic Bark,Leela," Fry, it's been three days. You can't keep boogie-ing like this. You'll come down with a fever of some sort."
Jurassic Bark,Ben Beeler," Mr. Fry? I'm Dr. Ben Beeler, the palaeontologist who discovered your dog. Or as some call it, the ""Beelersaurus""."
Jurassic Bark,Fry, So do I get Seymour back? Are you caving to political pressure?
Jurassic Bark,Beeler," No, we're sorry but there's just too much that fossil can teach us about dogs from your time."
Jurassic Bark,Fry," His name was Seymour. He was once intimate with the leg of a wandering saxophonist. He had wet dog smell, even when dry. And he was not above chasing the number 29 bus."
Jurassic Bark,Ray, The 29? Interesting.
Jurassic Bark,Beeler, That's all I needed. Ray?
Jurassic Bark,Ray, I'm good.
Jurassic Bark,Beeler, OK then. Here's your dog back.
Jurassic Bark,Fry, Seymour!
Jurassic Bark,Bender, Lady and gentleman! How 'bout a hand for my temporary replacement assistant?
Jurassic Bark,Zoidberg, I was all in this part! It's magic!
Jurassic Bark,Bender, You are not fit to wear Fry's leotard!
Jurassic Bark,Zoidberg, Stop!
Jurassic Bark,Fry," Good news, everyone!"
Jurassic Bark,Bender," Hooray, he's back! And he's looking for a garbage can to put the rock in! Here you go, buddy!"
Jurassic Bark,Farnsworth," No. Actually we've discovered that Fry's dog was fast-fossilised, preserving it's cellular structure!"
Jurassic Bark,Fry, Which means we can clone it! Seymour will live again!
Jurassic Bark,Zoidberg, A little land mammal!
Jurassic Bark,Fry," Can you believe it, Bender? I'm going to have my best friend back!"
Jurassic Bark,Cubert, Why the idiot convention?
Jurassic Bark,Farnsworth," Ah, Cubert, my precious babe. I'm going to attempt to clone Fry's dog using the very same apparatus I used to clone you. [He looks into the cloning tank.] Ooh, look! There's a smidge of toe still in here. [He picks it up and hands it to Cubert. He walks over to a computer and presses a button and Seymour appears.] You see, beneath the fossil's crunchy, mineral shell, there's still a creamy core of dog nougat."
Jurassic Bark,Fry, So will Seymour remember how to sing Walking On Sunshine?
Jurassic Bark,Farnsworth," Amazingly, yes. In cases of rapid fossilisation, I can press this brain scan button, retrieving Seymour's memories at the precise instant of doggy death."
Jurassic Bark,Fry," I'm gonna get my puppy back! In your face, Grim Reaper!"
Jurassic Bark,Bender, Crappy ineffective Reaper!
Jurassic Bark,Farnsworth, I just need to reset the Clone-O-Mat from Human Mode to Dog Mode.
Jurassic Bark,Computer Voice, The dog says--
Jurassic Bark,Farnsworth," Uh-oh, this may take a while."
Jurassic Bark,Boy," You stink, loser!"
Jurassic Bark,Panucci," Hey, Fry. Pizza goin' out. C'mon!"
Jurassic Bark,Fry, But I'm celebrating New Year's Eve.
Jurassic Bark,Panucci," Like you got squat to celebrate! You're a delivery boy this millennium and you'll be a delivery boy next millennium! [Fry sighs and picks up the pizza. He walks to the door. Seymour grabs his trouser leg and holds Fry back.] What's with Seymour? It's like he don't want you to go. Or he thinks your pants is too short, or somethin'. Which is crazy 'cause, frankly, you look fabulous. Now get goin'!"
Jurassic Bark,Fry," I won't be gone long, Seymour. Just wait here till I come back."
Jurassic Bark,Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for ... [He reads the delivery note.] ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud! [He sits down and opens the can.] Here's to another lousy millennium."
Jurassic Bark,Crowd," [chanting] Five, four, three, two."
Jurassic Bark,Fry, What the--?
Jurassic Bark,Bender," A dog collar, for me? [He puts it on.] You shouldn't have!"
Jurassic Bark,Fry, That's for Seymour.
Jurassic Bark,Bender, Oh.
Jurassic Bark,Bender," Say, why'd you get me a subscription to the Daily Growl? [He puts on some glasses.] That's not a reputable journal of opinion."
Jurassic Bark,Fry," Oh, that's also for Seymour. I'm getting everything ready for when he's cloned."
Jurassic Bark,Bender," Are you on the junk, Fry? Why are you wasting time on a creature of inferior intelligence?"
Jurassic Bark,Fry," Hey, he was smart! He could fetch."
Jurassic Bark,Bender, I can fetch.
Jurassic Bark,Fry, He could dig up bones.
Jurassic Bark,Bender," Hello? Charlemagne? [He opens his chest cabinet door, revealing bones and a crown.] Plus, I bet he couldn't create a laser show with his head."
Jurassic Bark,Fry," Look, Bender, this has nothing to do with you."
Jurassic Bark,Bender, That's impossible!
Jurassic Bark,Fry," Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm working on Seymour's doghouse."
Jurassic Bark,Bender," No one ever asks if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house. Not that I would. A tiny little house that says ""Bender"" on it. [Fry hammers the sign on but the hammer head flies off and hits Bender.] Ow!"
Jurassic Bark,Fry," [on phone] This is Fry. If you're calling about the used towels for sale, they're still available for $45 each."
Jurassic Bark,Mr. Fry," Phil, it's your father. Where are you? You're holding up New Year's brunch. Your brother can't wait any longer."
Jurassic Bark,Yancy," Hello, first baloney of the new millennium! [Seymour barks from outside.] Ah, here he comes. That's him and Seymour."
Jurassic Bark,Mrs. Fry, Well that's weird. Seymour's here but-- [She turns to the TV.] Go! Go! Touchdown! But where's Philip?
Jurassic Bark,Mr. Fry," I'm tellin' you, the Y2K computer's got him. We'll face burnin' roads, rivers exploding, calculators transformed into Scud missiles. There's nothing we can do. [Seymour climbs onto the TV and barks Walking On Sunshine.] What's that, Seymour? You walking on sunshine?"
Jurassic Bark,Yancy, He's trying to tell us something. Maybe he can lead us to Philip.
Jurassic Bark,Yancy, Should we follow him?
Jurassic Bark,Mr. Fry, To our deaths? Negatory.
Jurassic Bark,Mr. Fry, It's the Y2K tryin' to lure us into an ambush. And I ain't buyin' it. Pass the baloney.
Jurassic Bark,Fry, Are you two gonna be done soon?
Jurassic Bark,Leela," Sorry, but we need to practise hand-to-hand combat in case an enemy knocks the laser guns out of our hands and they slide way across the room."
Jurassic Bark,Fry, Well could you do it some place else? I'm setting up Seymour's doggy bed.
Jurassic Bark,Leela, OK.
Jurassic Bark,Bender," Heel, boy, heel! Oh, hello, Fry! I guess I didn't notice you there. I'm having such fun with my new best friend, Robo-Puppy."
Jurassic Bark,Fry, [indifferent] That's nice.
Jurassic Bark,Bender," I was just out walking him. Yes, you can walk him. Of course, after he goes you have to refill the canisters. C'mere, boy! Pet, pet, pet."
Jurassic Bark,Robo-Puppy, Robo-Puppy receiving petting.
Jurassic Bark,Amy," Bender, are you jealous of Fry's puppy? That's so adorable!"
Jurassic Bark,Bender," Jealous? [He laughs and picks up Robo-Puppy.] Not while I have the love of Robo-Puppy here. Robo-Puppy, lick my cheek."
Jurassic Bark,Robo-Puppy, Robo-Puppy preparing to lick cheek. [It's tongue comes out.] Robo-Puppy commencing cheek-licking. Licking in progress. Licking complete.
Jurassic Bark,Bender," Robo-Puppy truly is robot's best friend, huh?"
Jurassic Bark,Fry," Ah, there! Perfect!"
Jurassic Bark,Holo-Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! The Clone-O-Mat is ready!"
Jurassic Bark,Fry, Finally!
Jurassic Bark,Robo-Puppy, Robo-Puppy commencing two-hour yipping session. [It starts to yip and Bender kicks it against the wall.] Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert! Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert!
Jurassic Bark,Farnsworth," Behold once more, the mighty Clone-O-Mat! Requiring such vast amounts of electricity that we must harness the elemental power of nature itself. [Lightning strikes and the staff ""Ooh"".] I speak, of course, of molten lava deep within the Earth's core. To the sub-basement!"
Jurassic Bark,Farnsworth, Powering up Clone-O-Mat. [He plugs in the cord and the Clone-O-Mat bubbles.] Placing fossil on the Plat-Clone-O-Form. [He puts Seymour down.] Initiating dog brain CAT scan.
Jurassic Bark,Fry," Come on, boy! Come back to life!"
Jurassic Bark,Farnsworth, Know ye now what feels like to be dog god! Commencing DNA extraction.
Jurassic Bark,Bender," Fry, c'mon, the talent show!"
Jurassic Bark,Fry, What? I'm in the middle of something.
Jurassic Bark,Bender," But, if we don't perform, in what sense do we have an act?"
Jurassic Bark,Fry," Bender, enough! Leave me alone!"
Jurassic Bark,Bender," So that's how it is, huh? I thought you were my friend. But if you love your dog so much, maybe you'd rather play fetch!"
Jurassic Bark,Leela, No!
Jurassic Bark,Zoidberg, Oh!
Jurassic Bark,Bender, Now I'm all you got!
Jurassic Bark,Fry, I hate you! I hate you! You evil metal man! [He kicks him.] Ow!
Jurassic Bark,Bender, So anyway your dog is melted. Now we're friends again.
Jurassic Bark,Farnsworth, Not necessarily. For the dog may yet survive.
Jurassic Bark,Fry, May yet? Really?
Jurassic Bark,Farnsworth," Indeed. You see, that fossil was made of dolomite; The tough black mineral that won't cop out when there's heat all about. By contrast, observe the lava's affect on this ice swan. [He takes an ice swan out of the freezer and takes it towards the lava. It immediately melts.] Of course, that would have melted even at room temperature. I just wanted to get rid of it. But had it been made of that righteous mineral dolomite, there's a slim chance it might have survived."
Jurassic Bark,Fry, So Seymour might still exist?
Jurassic Bark,Farnsworth," Perhaps, for a few minutes. It's dolomite, baby!"
Jurassic Bark,Fry, Then I'm goin' in after him.
Jurassic Bark,Amy, [shouting] No!
Jurassic Bark,Leela, [shouting] Stop!
Jurassic Bark,Fry, He'd come after me!
Jurassic Bark,Leela, Acting like a moron won't bring your dog back.
Jurassic Bark,Fry," Then all hope is lost. [He lifts himself up and looks at the lava.] Goodbye, Seymour."
Jurassic Bark,Bender," Please stop crying, Fry. Here. [He hands him a coloured handkerchief which is tied to several more in his sleeve.] I assumed you were just pretending to love the dog to toy with my emotions. Oh, what have I done?"
Jurassic Bark,Zoidberg, You didn't do anything. Don't beat yourself up.
Jurassic Bark,Bender," Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature, because I love you. Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks, but the way a robot loves a human, a human loves a dog and, occasionally, a gorilla loves a kitty. [He looks into the lava.] I'm goin' in!"
Jurassic Bark,Farnsworth, I'm a professor! Why isn't anyone listening to me? You can't go in because you'll melt. The fossil only has a chance because it's made of dolomite.
Jurassic Bark,Bender," I'm 40% dolomite! [He bangs his chest and dives in. His hat and cape float on the surface and everyone gasps. Bender swims through the lava and his casing starts to come apart.] Oh, it's hot! It's very hot!"
Jurassic Bark,Cryogenisist, Ugh! I am one hungover cryogenisist. Just throw that mutt in the freezer till his owners get here.
Jurassic Bark,Plumber," You can't solve all your problems by freezing them, boss."
Jurassic Bark,Cryogenisist, I think you're forgetting our motto.
Jurassic Bark,Mr. Fry, Are you the cryogenisist who called about our son's dog?
Jurassic Bark,Cryogenisist," Oh, you must be the Frys. Yeah, he's right over there."
Jurassic Bark,Mrs. Fry, Sorry we're late. We all got sick from eating bad baloney.
Jurassic Bark,Mr. Fry, Y2K!
Jurassic Bark,Mrs. Fry, What's he so worked up about?
Jurassic Bark,Mr. Fry," He's just upset 'cause our boy's missing. [He clips a lead onto Seymour.] C'mon, you overgrown rat. Lead us to Philip."
Jurassic Bark,Leela, Bender's been down there too long. I'm going in after him.
Jurassic Bark,Farnsworth, Professor! Lava! Hot!
Jurassic Bark,Fry, This is all my fault. I let my best friend risk his life just to get my dead dog back. [He cries. The ground starts to shake and Bender erupts through it with Seymour.] Bender!
Jurassic Bark,Bender," And that is why they call me Bender the Magnificent! [His eyes melt and fall out.] Hey, where'd everybody go?"
Jurassic Bark,Bender, OK! Let's clone us some dog!
Jurassic Bark,Fry, Yeah!
Jurassic Bark,Farnsworth," Very well. Let this abomination unto the Lord begin! [He pulls the chain again and Seymour is zapped and his DNA is extracted. ""Species  Canais Familiaris. Age  15"" is displayed on a screen.] Interesting. It seems Seymour died at the ripe old age of 15."
Jurassic Bark,Fry, 15? You mean he lived for 12 more years after I got frozen?
Jurassic Bark,Farnsworth, Indeed.
Jurassic Bark,Fry, Stop the cloning.
Jurassic Bark,Farnsworth," Oh, sure! Smash the smart guy's machine!"
Jurassic Bark,Bender," Fry, what's wrong?"
Jurassic Bark,Fry, Think about it  Seymour lived a full life after I was gone. He probably even added new songs to his repertoire.
Jurassic Bark,Bender, But that's a good thing. Walking On Sunshine sucks noodles!
Jurassic Bark,Fry," I had Seymour till he was three. That's when I knew him and that's when I loved him. [He picks up Seymour's fossil.] I'll never forget him. But he forgot me a long, long time ago."
Jurassic Bark,,
Crimes of the Hot,Zoidberg," Hurry up with the water. I'm steaming inside my own shell, I am. It's that hot, it is!"
Crimes of the Hot,Leela, Hi-yah!
Crimes of the Hot,Fry," Man, it's hot! [different voice] How hot is it? [normal voice] It's so hot, I poured McDonald's coffee in my lap to cool off. [He chuckles.] Johnny Carson said it."
Crimes of the Hot,Leela," No, Nibbler! Don't drink the pool water! It's full of chlorine!"
Crimes of the Hot,Bender," Lightweights! Oh, wait, chlorine!"
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth, Perhaps this movie will help us take our minds off the heat.
Crimes of the Hot,Bender, [jittery] Focus!
Crimes of the Hot,Narrator, [voice-over] Global Warming Or  None Like It Hot!
Crimes of the Hot,Narrator," [in movie] You're probably wondering why your ice cream went away. Well, Suzie, the culprit isn't foreigners, it's global warming!"
Crimes of the Hot,Suzie, [in movie] Gwobal wappa?
Crimes of the Hot,Narrator," [in movie.] Uh, yeah! Meet Mr. Sunbeam. He comes all the way from the sun to visit Earth."
Crimes of the Hot,Mr. Sunbeam," [in movie.] Hello, Earth! Just poppin' in to brighten your day! [He hums a tune.] And now I'll be on my way!"
Crimes of the Hot,Gas," [in movie] Not so fast, Sunbeam! We're greenhouse gases. You ain't goin' nowhere!"
Crimes of the Hot,Mr. Sunbeam," [in movie] Ooh! Ah! Oh, God, it hurts!"
Crimes of the Hot,Narrator," [in movie] Pretty soon, Earth is chock-full of sunbeams ... [Dead Sunbeams are piled up.] ... their rotting corpses heating our atmosphere."
Crimes of the Hot,Suzie, [in movie] How do we get wid of the gweenhouse grasses?
Crimes of the Hot,Narrator," [in movie] Fortunately, our handsomest politicians came up with a cheap, last-minute way to combat global warming. Ever since 2063 we simply drop a giant ice cube into the ocean every now and then."
Crimes of the Hot,Suzie, [in movie] Just like Daddy puts in his drink every morning.  And then he gets mad.
Crimes of the Hot,Narrator," [in movie] Of course, since the greenhouse gases are still building up, it takes more and more ice each time. [There are shots of bigger ice cubes being dropped into the ocean.] Thus solving the problem once and for all."
Crimes of the Hot,Suzie, [in movie] But--
Crimes of the Hot,Narrator, [angry; in movie.] Once and for all!
Crimes of the Hot,Leela," Well, we just need one of those big ice cubes. Someone should call the losers who are supposed to deliver it. [The phone rings. Leela answers.] Hello?"
Crimes of the Hot,Nixon, [on screen] President Nixon here. [Zoidberg salutes.] I'm hiring you losers to deliver the ice. And hurry up! I'm sweating like J. Edgar Hoover trying to squeeze into a new girdle!
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth," You heard the good news, everyone! Save the Earth, et cetera, et cetera! [He stands up and starts ushering them out.] Bye!"
Crimes of the Hot,Fry, Wait! Where do we get the ice?
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth," The wha? Oh, Halley's Comet, of course. The only sufficient source of ice cubes that don't have bugs in them."
Crimes of the Hot,Fry, Wow! Mining a comet! That sounds fun.
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth," Yes, there's no safer occupation than mining. Especially when you're perched on a snowball whipping through space at a million miles an hour. [He mimes a snowball whipping through space at a million miles an hour.] Safe!"
Crimes of the Hot,Bender, [shouting] Deploying ice drill.
Crimes of the Hot,Fry," Wow! That ice dispenser's so big, the ice crushes you! [He chuckles.] Yakov Smirnov said it."
Crimes of the Hot,Leela," No, he didn't."
Crimes of the Hot,Bender, [shouting] Activating ice drill.
Crimes of the Hot,Fry," Oh, my God! It's out of ice! Like some outer space Motel 6!"
Crimes of the Hot,Leela, Completely out of ice?
Crimes of the Hot,Bender, This could mean the end of the banana daiquiri as we know it ... also life.
Crimes of the Hot,Linda," [on TV] With Halley's Comet out of ice, Earth is experiencing the devastating effects of sudden intense global warming."
Crimes of the Hot,Morbo," [on TV] Morbo is pleased but sticky. The scorching heat has melted the polar ice caps, causing floods of biblical proportion."
Crimes of the Hot,Randy, [on TV] They called me crazy for building this ark.
Crimes of the Hot,Soupy, [on TV] You are crazy. You filled it with same-sex animal couples!
Crimes of the Hot,Randy, [on TV] Hey! There are parts of the Bible I like and parts I don't like.
Crimes of the Hot,Morbo, [voice-over; on TV] Direct your attention now to the African turtles seen here migrating to cooler homes in Holland.
Crimes of the Hot,Bender, [crying] That poor turtle!
Crimes of the Hot,Fry, Bender? Are you crying?
Crimes of the Hot,Bender," [crying] Uh, no! Never!"
Crimes of the Hot,Morbo, [on TV] Morbo wishes these stalwart nomads peace among the Dutch tulips.
Crimes of the Hot,Linda, [on TV] I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.
Crimes of the Hot,Morbo, [shouting; on TV] Windmills do not work that way! [He turns to the camera.] Goodnight!
Crimes of the Hot,Bender," Well, everybody, I just saved a turtle. What have you done with your lives?"
Crimes of the Hot,Hermes, You went all the way to Holland already?
Crimes of the Hot,Leela," Bender, a turtle isn't yourself. Why do you care about it?"
Crimes of the Hot,Bender, Because I also care deeply about things that remind me of myself. Like poor little Shelly here.
Crimes of the Hot,Hermes, What could you possibly have in common with this walking soup mix?
Crimes of the Hot,Bender," For one thing, we both have a tough outer shell. [He bangs his casing then the turtle's shell.] But lead a rich, inner life. And also ... well, you know."
Crimes of the Hot,Leela," You're both alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain-smoking gamblers?"
Crimes of the Hot,Bender, No! It's just ... neither of us can get up when we get knocked on our back.
Crimes of the Hot,Fry, What? I've seen you get up off your back tons of times.
Crimes of the Hot,Bender, Those times I was slightly on my side.
Crimes of the Hot,Hermes," Interesting. Maybe we should test this erectile dysfunction of yours, Bender."
Crimes of the Hot,Bender," Uh, no! That's not necessary, really! I think I hear my factory recalling me. [Amy crouches behind Bender and he trips over her and he and the turtle land on their backs.] Oh! That's what I get for sharing my vulnerability with you."
Crimes of the Hot,Van," Calling all scientists, calling all scientists. Be advised there will be a worldwide conference on global warming in Kyoto, Japan."
Crimes of the Hot,Man, I've got a degree in homeopathic medicine!
Crimes of the Hot,Van, You've got a degree in baloney!
Crimes of the Hot,Amy," Professor Farnsworth, you're a scientist!"
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth," Forget it, I'm not going! I have my reasons! Shut up, all of you!"
Crimes of the Hot,Hermes," Strange. You haven't acted this suspicious since I found those ""ape bones"" in the basement."
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth," My hip hurts! I'm in the middle of cooking a turkey! I have warranty cards to fill out! I am not just making excuses! Alright, I'll go!"
Crimes of the Hot,Woman #1," [shouting] Oh, God, I can't believe it!"
Crimes of the Hot,Woman #2, [shouting] I love you!
Crimes of the Hot,Rivers," Oh, oh, oh! It's Professor Hubert Farnsworth! He's looking sharp in a standard white lab coat and dark slacks! His wristwatch is a Casio."
Crimes of the Hot,Van, Thank you all for coming. It is my pleasure to introduce the host of the Kyoto Global Warming Convention. The inventor of the environment and first Emperor of the Moon  Al Gore.
Crimes of the Hot,Al Gore's head, I have ridden the mighty Moon Worm.
Crimes of the Hot,Fry, Good for him!
Crimes of the Hot,Gore," My fellow Earthicans, as I discuss in my book Earth in the Balance and the much more popular Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth, we need to defend our planet against pollution. As well as dark wizards."
Crimes of the Hot,Dark Wizard, Sure! Blame the wizards!
Crimes of the Hot,Gore," That's why I'm offering a bag of Moon Sapphires to the first scientist who can solve this problem once and for all. [The audience ""Ooh's"".] Lovely, aren't they?"
Crimes of the Hot,Dark Wizard, Sapphires? [He cackles.] With those I could open the Gate of Kerash!
Crimes of the Hot,Gore, First up is Professor Ogden Wernstrom.
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth, Wernstrom!
Crimes of the Hot,Wernstrom," Ladies and gentlemen, I have placed in orbit a giant mirror that will reflect 40% of the sun's rays, thus cooling Earth. Observe."
Crimes of the Hot,Wernstrom, Problem solved.
Crimes of the Hot,Man, Ooh! That's a little bright.
Crimes of the Hot,Gore," Alright, what else we got?"
Crimes of the Hot,Fry," Professor, you're a professor. You must have some ideas."
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth, Absolutely not! I won't speak! I've got nothing to hide!
Crimes of the Hot,Gore, Our next speaker is Professor--
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth, I demand the floor!
Crimes of the Hot,Gore," Yes, it's your turn to speak."
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth," Well nuts to me. I'm taking the stage! [He walks on stage.] I know the source of the greenhouse gases. But in my shame I've kept it secret for 75 long years. Oh, it haunts my memory still."
Crimes of the Hot,Fry," Professor, no! Don't do it!"
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth, Don't do what? Don't use this memory ray so I can remember what happened back then?
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth," [voice-over] It was October 17th at 1 54pm and 14 birds were flying by the window. I was working at Mom's Friendly Robot Company. Back then, you see, robots were slow-moving, stiff and a little on the uptight side."
Crimes of the Hot,Prototype," Oh, dear. Might I favour master with a tender kiss on the forehead?"
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth," Oh, I've failed again."
Crimes of the Hot,Prototype," Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!"
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth, [voice-over] The owner of the company pressured me to create a bigger sportier robot.
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth, Stop!
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth," [voice-over] It wasn't easy but, by sacrificing fuel efficiency, I succeeded."
Crimes of the Hot,Mom, What was that?
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth, A flaming burp.
Crimes of the Hot,Mom, Does it always do that?
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth, It's not always a burp. We still have one problem though  This robot will never meet emission standards.
Crimes of the Hot,Mom, Crap spackle! [She slaps him.] We'll just call it a sport utility robot and classify it as a light truck.
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth," Well, I suppose the environment can take one more for the team."
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth, [voice-over] What a fool I was. If only I had made the effort to develop a cleaner-burning robot. But I was tired and in love.
Crimes of the Hot,Mom," Take me now, you stud!"
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth," Oh, this is all my fault!"
Crimes of the Hot,Fry," That's awful, Professor. Especially the making-out part."
Crimes of the Hot,Gore," Yeah, I didn't need to hear that."
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth, All modern robots descend from my original smog-blasting designs. And that's the cause of global warming today.
Crimes of the Hot,Wernstrom," Huh, so the robots are to blame. As I suspected. [He speaks into the microphone.] We are left with only one possible course of action, grim though it be."
Crimes of the Hot,Bender, I got a good feeling about this!
Crimes of the Hot,Wernstrom," We must immediately and permanently shut down, dismantle and destroy all robots!"
Crimes of the Hot,Bender, No!
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth," Wait, surely there's a better--"
Crimes of the Hot,Van, The conference is over.
Crimes of the Hot,Gore," I must go now, to help collect cans on Jupiter. Peace out, y'all!"
Crimes of the Hot,Crowd, [chanting] Destroy all robots! Destroy all robots!
Crimes of the Hot,Amy, Poor Bender.
Crimes of the Hot,Fry," Be brave, my friend."
Crimes of the Hot,Leela, Come on. You've got to come out of your chest sometime. [She holds up a bottle of beer.] Would you do it for a Bender snack?
Crimes of the Hot,Fry, Aha!
Crimes of the Hot,Leela, Gotcha!
Crimes of the Hot,Bender, Let me go! I don't even want the stupid beer! [They struggle with the bottle. Bender pulls it away and runs off with it.] Yes! You tried to trick me into coming out of my chest. But who has the beer now? [He cackles and his head comes out. He drinks the beer and flag appears on his antenna.] I've got mail!
Crimes of the Hot,Amy," Ooh! It's a party, apparently."
Crimes of the Hot,Nixon, [on card] Do you like to party? To boogie down? Well I'm throwing an all-night beach raver for my robot pals. It all goes down Saturday on the isolated Galapagos Islands where there will be no escape ... from the fun! All robots must attend.
Crimes of the Hot,Zoidberg," Strange  Why would Nixon, an awkward, uncomfortable man, suddenly throw a party, one of the most social events imaginable? [He snaps his claws.] It's a trap, is why! They're going to deactivate all the robots! [No one reacts.] I don't hear any gasping."
Crimes of the Hot,Leela, We all figured that out.
Crimes of the Hot,Bender," Well, I'm off."
Crimes of the Hot,Fry, Wait! We could hide you. We'll pile fruit on you and claim you're a bowl.
Crimes of the Hot,Bender, No. I'm going to the party.
Crimes of the Hot,Fry, I won't let you!
Crimes of the Hot,Bender," Fry, as you know, there are lots of things I'm willing to kill for. Jewels, vengeance, Father O'Mally's weed whacker. But, at long last, I've found something I'm willing to die for  This mindless turtle."
Crimes of the Hot,Fry," Bender, this world isn't good enough for you."
Crimes of the Hot,Bender," Not even close. Goodbye, everybody! Don't touch my stuff after I'm dead. [He leaves.] [shouting] It's booby trapped!"
Crimes of the Hot,Robot #1," Oh, yeah!"
Crimes of the Hot,Robot #2," Come on, baby!"
Crimes of the Hot,Bender," Poor guy. Maybe you'd feel better if I had a drink. [He pumps a keg but it is dry.] Crummy keg! It's completely ta-- Oh, you're a robot!"
Crimes of the Hot,Keg Robot, Don't stop!
Crimes of the Hot,Bender, Ew!
Crimes of the Hot,Nixon," Attention, happening robots  Who's got what it takes to party with Nixon? [The robots cheer.] You fellas enjoy yourselves for the next two hours. And be sure not to leave the island, uh, for at least two hours. I'm going out to pick up some smokes ... uh, really good smokes. Two hours. [The robots cheer.] OK, headless body of Agnew, let's blow this joint!"
Crimes of the Hot,Crushinator, [mechanical voice] Do you want to dance?
Crimes of the Hot,Bender," Nah, I'm not really in the--"
Crimes of the Hot,Crushinator, [mechanical voice] You know you want to.
Crimes of the Hot,Wernstrom," Per your orders, I modified my mirror to fire a colossal electromagnetic pulse at the Galapagos. Every robot will be instantly and painfully terminated. Now for your part of the bargain."
Crimes of the Hot,Nixon," Aroo! Very well. Agnew, you belong to Wernstrom now."
Crimes of the Hot,Bender," I'll say goodbye now. There ain't not turtles where daddy's a-going. [whispering] Don't tell anybody, but Nixon's about to shut all robots off and--"
Crimes of the Hot,Boom Mic-bot, [shouting] What?
Crimes of the Hot,Robot #3, [shouting] We're gonna die!
Crimes of the Hot,Preacherbot, [shouting] We're going to the great beyond!
Crimes of the Hot,Chain Smoker, [shouting] Nixon's not bringing the smokes!
Crimes of the Hot,Bender," Shut up and pay attention to me, Bender! [The robots stop panicking and turn around. Roberto stabs the robot who couldn't make his payments in Bender Gets Made.] Look, I love life and its pleasures as much as anyone here. Except perhaps you, Hedonismbot. [The Hedonismbot eats grapes.] But we need to be shut off! Especially you, Hedonismbot!"
Crimes of the Hot,Hedonismbot, I apologise for nothing!
Crimes of the Hot,Bender, We pollute too much. We're destroying the world and killing the turtles.
Crimes of the Hot,Preacherbot, To hell with the turtles!
Crimes of the Hot,Bender, No one insults the turtles!
Crimes of the Hot,Preacherbot," Oh, mercy!"
Crimes of the Hot,Bender, Come on!
Crimes of the Hot,Hedonismbot, Let the games begin!
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth," Everyone, listen!"
Crimes of the Hot,Preacherbot," Aw, damn!"
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth," I've devised a way to save you and stop global warming at the same time. Granted, you're all blasting out greenhouse gases--"
Crimes of the Hot,Bender, [shouting] You're one to talk!
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth," But we can use those very gases to save the planet. If you all vent your exhaust directly upward in one burst, it should thrust the Earth further from the sun, thus cooling it. [The robots ""Ooh"".] By my calculations, we'll need the full force of every last robot. So, quickly, everyone point your exhaust vents straight upwards. [The robots turn their exhausts up.] Now vent! Vent like the wind! [The robots vent. A huge flame rises into the sky but nothing happens.] Harder! Harder!"
Crimes of the Hot,Fry, Why isn't this working?!
Crimes of the Hot,Leela, Some lazy or polite robot is holding it in.
Crimes of the Hot,Bender, Help! Help!
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth," A billion robot lives are about to be extinguished. Oh, the Jedis are going to feel this one!"
Crimes of the Hot,Bender," I'm sorry, buddy. At least we'll die on our backs, helpless. [The turtle starts to rock from side to side.] Huh? What the hell are you doing? [It rocks onto it's feet and walks away.] Hey, you trying to make me look bad? [He rocks on his back, working his body with his arms and manages to get up.] Aha! I'm even greater than I thought I was! And now to fulfill my destiny."
Crimes of the Hot,Nixon, Fire! [Wernstrom presses a button but the pulse misses.] What the--?
Crimes of the Hot,Wernstrom, We missed!
Crimes of the Hot,Nixon," Professor, for saving the Earth and foiling me, I proudly, yet angrily, present you with Earth's new highest honour  The Polluting Medal of Pollution."
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth, Thank you. I deserve this!
Crimes of the Hot,Bender," Hey, Professor, now that the Earth's orbit is further from the sun, won't that make the year longer?"
Crimes of the Hot,Farnsworth," Why, yes! One week longer to be exact."
Crimes of the Hot,Nixon, In that case I hereby declare it Robot Party Week!
Crimes of the Hot,Bender," Alright, baby!"
Crimes of the Hot,,
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Pazuzu, you ungrateful gargoyle! I put you through college, and this is how you repay me?"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Let's get this gargoyle hunt on the road. Driving gloves, driving goggles, driving thong. There!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," Uh, maybe I should drive."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," You? A woman? I'm trying to catch a monster, not find the quickest route to the mall! Let me just adjust the seat."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry," My God! He's gonna do it! Everybody, seatbelts to maximum buckling."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," [shouting; from ship] Pazuzu? Oh, Pazuzu?"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Randy," [from car] Hey, grandpa, move your wrinkly old kiester!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, [from ship] Shut up!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," For Heaven's Gate, Professor. This ship can do 99% light speed. Why are we going 35 miles an hour?"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Because we're in a hurry, that's why."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," Plus, you have the high beams on!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, [from ship] I can't quite read the sign. [The high beams vaporise the sign and then destroy a space station similar to Deep Space Nine.] Pazuzu? Pazuzu?
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Bender," Yo, Captain Cataract? What are we doing here?"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Oh, it's 2.30. We can still catch the early bird dinner special."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry," Uh, aren't we looking for your gargoyle?"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, My wha?
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Hello, Mavis! Surprised to see me back again so soon?"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Wanda, Mavis is dead.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," I expect you'll want to see my angry, crotchety, grandpa discount card."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Wanda," Sir, this card has expired."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, But it's good for a lifetime.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Wanda," Well, yours expired."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," Oh, Lord! Teeth do not belong in your pants, Professor."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Well, I can't keep them in my mouth. They're nuclear-powered!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry, Ow! It bit my finger!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela, No! No! It's tasted human blood!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, Mmm! Damn good meat!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," Professor, we've talked it over and everybody thinks you're too old."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Amy, Right on.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry, Yup.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Bender, Uh-huh!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Hermes, We've decided to do the merciful thing and have you euthasised.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Dear God, no!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Amy," Oh, relax, Professor. ""Youthasizing"" is a trendy, new spa treatment. It's this season's shark-cartilage enema."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," But I like being old. I don't have to talk to my parents, no one asks me to help move their stuff, I don't need to understand today's ""edgy"" TV sitcoms."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," OK, OK. We're not gonna force you until I finish this sentence. Get him!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, [shouting] My thong!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Heather," Hi! I'm Heather, your personal Youthasizer. Let's get started with a nice botulism treatment, shall we?"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Go to hell, Heather!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Heather," Oh! [She smiles and draws a syringe of warm canned mushrooms.] In small doses, botchelism toxin tightens and tones the facial muscles instead of killing you in the most horrible fashion imaginable."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, Give me back my floppy face!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, Careful with the giblets!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Heather, Hmm. You're still retaining a lot of grump in these joints. [She turns to the masseuse.] More pressure.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Heather," Since this is such a serious case of old, we'll have to try our strongest treatment  A soothing full-body bath in searing-hot tar. [She indicates the pits.] Sir, it's not necessary or wise to be naked."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, You sound just like my tennis instructor.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Heather, The tar blisters the age right out of the body in what top scientists suspect is a miracle.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry, He still sounds sorta old. Sorta real old.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Bender," Step aside, lady. [He starts pumping.] Like everything else in life, pumping is just a primitive, degenerate form of bending. [He pumps harder and the tar starts bobbing around. It throws Farnsworth up and down. The staff watch.] [mean voice] C'mon, Bender, pump harder! Harder! [weak voice] I'm trying as hard as I can. [mean voice] Harder, damn you!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Well, that was an utter waste of time."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Amy," Professor, it worked! You look young enough to be my father!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Poodle spit! [Heather scans him and the scanner displays ""53"". He gasps.] 53 years old? [He sighs.] Now I'll need a fake ID to rent ultra-porn."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry," [voice breaking] This is great, Professor! We should go out and celebrate!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, Dear Lord! You've all reverted to your childhood forms.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Zoidberg, Hooray! I'm a teenage heartthrob again!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," While I try to restore our normal ages, I expect you all to go about your jobs like responsible professionals."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Hermes," It wasn't me, Mr. F. It was Amy! [He fires one at Zoidberg.] Stop it, Amy!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Amy, You stink!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Hermes, You know you did it!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Quiet! Quiet, I say!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,LaBarbara," We're here to take my little stub of a husband home. Hermes, say goodbye to Mr. Farnsworth."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Hermes," Goodbye, Mr. Dumbsworth!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela, Hey! This my chance to spend time with my parents too.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry, But your parents are gross sewer mutants.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," When I was an orphan, I always wished I could grow up with my mom and dad. And now, thanks to being hurled backwards in time--"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, That's not what happened! Shut up and go live with your parents.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," It's gonna be totally awesome, Mom! You and me can bake and argue about my hairstyle hiding my pretty face. And if some kid picks on me, my dad can beat up his dad."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Morris, Can't I just beat up the kid?
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Munda," Well, OK, Leela. If you think you can put up with your father, then welcome home. We'll try to respect your independence and freedom."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," No! I want the real teen experience  Chores, curfew, the works!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Morris," Fine, Sweetiekins, we'll be the strictest parents ever. Now, let's all have some tequila to celebrate!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela, Dad! I'm underage!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Morris," Oh, right. Here's a silly straw."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Mrs. Wong," Oh, my Amy's sweet little girl again! This is like a mother's dream. Bad dream, that is! At this rate, I'm never going to get a grandchild!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Mr. Wong, Maybe she not grown up but she sure grown out! She fat!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Amy," Dad, if you're gonna make fat jokes till I get cute again, I'm just gonna stay in my room."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Mr. Wong," Stay in room? You so fat, you gonna stay all around room!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork every three hours. And those jerks at social security stopped sending me checks. Now I have to pay them!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Bender," I'm tired of your yapping. [He rides into the room on a motorbike and knocks over a table.] All you ever do is complain, you never try to make things better. Well, I'm running away from this dead-end family! I know there's a place for people like me with new ideas. There has to be!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, Fine! Get going!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Bender," Oh, I'm going! You're gonna be all ""Where's Bender? I miss Bender""."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, We won't know that until you leave.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Bender," Oh, I'm leaving!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, There's the door.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Bender, I'll be good.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Munda," Ah, do you have to shed your skin on the couch? What do we live in, a zoo?"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Morris, I'm getting the doorbell. [He gets up and opens the door. Fry stands in the doorway with flowers.] For me?
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry," [voice breaking] Oh, uh, hello, sir. It's a lovely evening you have tonight. Um, I'm here to pick up your daughter."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," Hi, Fry! I like your blazer."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry," Thanks. These aren't pockets, they're just flaps. I put my money in my sock."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Munda," So, where are you taking my daughter tonight?"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry," [voice breaking] A movie. [deep voice] A movie, ma'am."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Morris," Well, whatever you're really doing, don't wake us if you get in after 12."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," Dad, you're being too lenient again! I have to be back by 11."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Munda," OK, OK. You're the boss!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," No, I'm not!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry, I'd like a sewer burger but without the rat faeces.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," What are you, on a diet?"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Moose," Uh, Leela, you look hot."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Mandy," Jeez, Moose! Just dump me right in front of her, why don't you."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," Moose, Mandy; this is my friend Fry, from the surface."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Mandy," Oh, so this is the famous Fry. What is he, like, the biggest loser on the surface so he has to hang out in the sewer?"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry, [whispering] They're onto me!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," Hey, come on! Let's act like grown-ups here. Wanna race?"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Moose," Uh, yeah!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Sal, Theres. The world's drinkings water is safes for another days. [Moose's car comes flying through.] Whoas! [Followed by Leela's car.] Cripe!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela, A tapeworm!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry, We missed the turn. We'll never catch them.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," Yes, we will. This sewer goes right under Planet Express, and it's 9pm!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, [from bathroom] The devil take this predictable colon!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry, Yeah!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela, Alright!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry," Leela, you can stop winning now. We won!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela, I'm too short to reach the handbrake!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Dwayne, That's detention!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry," And then, and then, this giant tapeworm tried to play us for chumps but we like totally dissed Moose!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Yes, I'd like to meet this Moose. But, in the meantime, I have good news. I may have solved our age problem."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry, Yay!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," It seems the Youthasizing tar was saturated with time-altering Chronitons. A thin layer is still stuck to our DNA as well as Bender's robo, or ""RNA""."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Bender, Question.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, Yes?
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Bender, You stink!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Yes, yes. Anyhow, I've designed an oil-eating bacterium that should take the tar right off."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry, [voice breaking] C'mon! Let's go tell Leela so we can grow up together!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," Thanks, Professor. But I don't want the treatment."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Don't you understand, you little nitwit? Unless you're treated soon, the only way to restore your true age would be to grow into it! Just as God intended."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Munda," He has a point, honey. What about your job and your friends? Do you really want to abandon your old life?"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," My old life wasn't as glamorous as my webpage made it look. All I ever wanted was to grow up here, with you. Please?"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Munda, Well if it's what you really want.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela, It is. I know it is.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry," I'll miss you, Leela. I'll come back and visit when I'm all grown up."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela, [whispering] Bring beer.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Morris, No beer till you finish your tequila!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, [shouting] The age-restoring microbes are ready. Everyone into the bacterial spew chamber.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Amy, Let's go!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Bender," [sarcastic] Yes, everyone do the same thing!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, Initiating controlled infection.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Zoidberg," I'm no doctor, but this machine guy could use a lozenge."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Amy," Aw, pooh! We're even younger!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Day-umn! The bacteria pigged-out on the tar and now they're getting freaky-deaky, spreading Chronitons throughout our systems. We're getting younger by the minute!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Amy, Yikes!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Zoidberg, What? I'm going to revert through all my larval stages?
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, Word! We'll all keep getting younger and younger until we suffer a fate worse than death  Pre-life ... then death.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," I've got to stop this reverse-aging before we all shrivel up and suffer the agony of un-birth. Think, you disco duck, think!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Amy, What's that squirmal under your shirt?
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Get off me, you parasitic lamprey!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Zoidberg," Oh, sure, like you need all your blood."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Would you all chill! I can't think with you kids cramping my style! Oh, I need a babysitter."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," OK, quiet time. I know, everyone pretend a goblin ate your tongue and I'll read you a story."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Zoidberg," I can't see from down here, I can't."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela, There. Today's story is from New Teen magazine. What would you rather hear about? Four-legged Chachi or tentacled Chachi?
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry, I wanna hear a space story!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," It's kind of a baby book. But OK. Let's see. Snow White Dwarf And The Seven Red Dwarves, Charlotte's Tholian Web, The Fountain Of Aging."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," The Fountain of Aging? Hmm. It is just a legend. Still, they called the Tooth Fairy a legend and now he's head of the FBI."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, Sup? Kids ready?
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry, Professy's back! [He lets go.] Ew! You smell like smoking! [He sniffs.] And drinking.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, I had a few beers but I'm cool to drive.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," I wish I could come with you to say goodbye, before you all turn back in to grown-ups but I'm grounded for knocking the school over."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Munda," Who cares, Leela? It was just a public school. Now go with your friends, please."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela, No! A grounded teenager must be confined to her room!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela, Until she sneaks out!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Bender," When I grow up, I wanna be a steam shovel!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," According to this, the Fountain is located in the darkest, most ancient region of space, just past Teddy Bear Junction."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, Teddy Bear Junction  The worst scum-hole in the galaxy.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," This solar system is, like, way old."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela, Look how high the asteroid belt is pulled up on that planet.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Newsflash! Everything's getting older the closer we get to that ancient, burnt-out sun."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," Dude, the Fountain of Aging must be on the sun itself."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, Shut up! I was gonna say that!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela, We've got to hurry. The kids have only one change of pants!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," We gotta be real, real careful to stay in just long enough to make us our right ages again. [Zoidberg falls in and rapidly ages.] [shouting] Zoidberg! Get out of there!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Zoidberg," [shouting] The current! It's too much, already! Help!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, Jeepers!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela, Zoidberg is dead!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Zoidberg, No! Zoidberg's brother is dead! [Zoidberg has many heads and sits on the steps.] Funny story  I just reverted to the age where my siblings budded from me and my brother Norman split off and jumped in the fountain.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Sibling #1, He always had to be the centre of attention!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Sibling #2, Let him go!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," Oh, no! [The kids revert to foetuses in goo. Bender reverts to a CD of Bending Unit Blueprints.] Quick! Get them into the fountain!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," Thanks for the help, Weewa. Once we're gwown up, you can go back to your famiwy. We'wl never bother you again."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," Well, you could bother me a little."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, It's working! Hooray! [He starts to lose his grip.] I can't hold on!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela, I'm coming in after you!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," [shouting] No, Leela! You can't give up your childhood! You'll never have another chance at it!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry, We did it! We're the right ages again!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela, I think I might be a couple years younger.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Amy," Oh, me too!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," [shouting] Help! I'm still in mid-peril, you clods!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela, He's too far out! We can't reach him!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," [shouting] With my last breath I curse Zoidberg! [He disappears into the vortex. Pazuzu comes out from under the ships wing and flies in and saves him.] Pazuzu! Oh, you came back to me!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Hermes," Are you back to your original age, Professor?"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth, Even older! Huzzah!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry," I'm sorry you had to give up being a kid, Leela."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela," Well, I guess every adult wants to be a kid again sometimes. But I worked hard to be the person I am."
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry, The fabulous person!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela, With friends like you guys--
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Fry, Fabulous friends!
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Leela, And I'm really happy I have that life back.
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Farnsworth," And you, my faithful fiend! How can I ever repay you?"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,Pazuzu," [""French"" accent] And zat, little one, is how Papa gained his freedom. Now, bonne nuit, bonne nuit to you all!"
Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles,,
The Why of Fry,Fry," Delivery boy Philip J. Fry, reporting for duty."
The Why of Fry,Zoidberg," Dr. Zoidberg, soaking in brine."
The Why of Fry,Fry," What is the meaning of this? We've got a delivery, people. Let's move! Let's move! [Amy and Zoidberg hop to it. Zoidberg woops.] Amy? Mission profile? [She hands him a card and he moves it backwards and forwards. The card is a hologram of a stick person handing a parcel to a dragon.] Interesting, interesting. Dr. Zoidberg, mission bag?"
The Why of Fry,Zoidberg," Packed and ready, sir."
The Why of Fry,Fry, What's this? This is the same toy surprise I got last time! [He throws it back at Zoidberg.] I can't work under these conditions. And without me there is no mission. I am the mission!
The Why of Fry,Leela, [shouting] We're back from the mission!
The Why of Fry,Fry, Wh-What? You went without me?
The Why of Fry,Bender, [shouting] You were looking up curse words in the dictionary. It seemed like a better use of your time.
The Why of Fry,Fry, But-- But I'm the delivery boy.
The Why of Fry,Leela, Don't worry. Everything went fine.
The Why of Fry,Bender, Better than usual!
The Why of Fry,Leela," We got medals! Good work, team! We really pulled together on this one."
The Why of Fry,Zoidberg, [whispering] They got medals.
The Why of Fry,Fry, I'm real sorry I missed the mission. I wasn't there and you might have needed me.
The Why of Fry,Bender, Nope.
The Why of Fry,Fry, But if I'd been there I--
The Why of Fry,Bender, Nope.
The Why of Fry,Fry, Look--
The Why of Fry,Bender, Nope.
The Why of Fry,Fry, Bender's great--
The Why of Fry,Bender, Nope!
The Why of Fry,Fry," Listen, Leela, let me make it up by taking you out to dinner tonight."
The Why of Fry,Leela, Nope. [She closes her locker door.] I've got a date with Chaz.
The Why of Fry,Fry, Chaz?
The Why of Fry,Leela, I met him at that charity cock fight last week. He's the mayor's aide.
The Why of Fry,Bender," Ooh! You go, mutant girl!"
The Why of Fry,Leela, I do go! He's a very important man.
The Why of Fry,Fry," So? I'm just as important as him. [Leela and Bender stare.] It's just that, the kind of importance I have ... it doesn't matter if I [quietly] don't do it."
The Why of Fry,Fry, I'm nobody. There are guys in the background of Mary Worth comics who are more important than me.
The Why of Fry,Bender," Ah, buck up, meatloaf. Bender'll take you out tonight and cheer you up. What do you wanna do? And I mean anything. You have the power! Name it and I'm there. You the man!"
The Why of Fry,Fry," Um, OK. Let's go bowling."
The Why of Fry,Bender, Nah.
The Why of Fry,Elzar, Table for two? Step right this way.
The Why of Fry,Chaz," I'm afraid we don't have a reservation but, uh, as you can see ... [He pulls out his badge.] ... I'm the mayor's aide. Table for two, please."
The Why of Fry,Elzar, OK then.
The Why of Fry,Elzar, Bam!
The Why of Fry,Chaz," It's OK, my man. I got you covered on your next health inspection."
The Why of Fry,Elzar," I really appreciate that, mister mayor's aide. [He wipes the cockroach off the bread and puts it down on the table.] Here you go. Compliments of the house."
The Why of Fry,Leela, Wow! Free bread at a restaurant? Is there anything you can't do?
The Why of Fry,Chaz, I can't fail the mayor. Not ever.
The Why of Fry,Fry," Oh, jeez! Better not let Leela see me."
The Why of Fry,Leela," Hey, I hear Fry. [She walks over to him.] Boy, am I glad you're here."
The Why of Fry,Fry, You are? So things aren't working out with whatshisname?
The Why of Fry,Leela," Actually ... they are! Confidentially, I might not make it back to my apartment tonight! Could you walk Nibbler for me?"
The Why of Fry,Fry, Um ... uh...
The Why of Fry,Leela, And bring a baggy in case he drops a steamer. [shouting] Have a great night!
The Why of Fry,Fry," Oh, no! Please! No! [The ground shakes as Nibbler drops one.] Perfect!"
The Why of Fry,Smitty, Whoa! Smells like a 289 in progress.
The Why of Fry,URL," Failure to scoop. Aw, yeah!"
The Why of Fry,Fry, Wait! I'm trying. It weighs as much as a thousand suns.
The Why of Fry,Chaz," [shouting] Don't worry, Fry. I'll pull some strings -- see if I can't get you tried as a juvenile."
The Why of Fry,Leela," Oh, Chaz!"
The Why of Fry,Fry, I'm as worthless as this trash can.
The Why of Fry,Trash Can," You think I'm as worthless as you? Try catching garbage in your head and raising six kids, you dumb townie!"
The Why of Fry,Fry," Oh, Nibbler, at least I'm important to you. Even if it's only 'cause I clean up you poop."
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, The poop eradication is but one aspect of your importance.
The Why of Fry,Fry, D-D-Did you just talk?
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, Indeed. And I have other amazing powers as well.
The Why of Fry,Fry, Like what?
The Why of Fry,Fry, Are you my mommy?
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, Negative.
The Why of Fry,Fiona," Welcome, Lord Nibbler."
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, Welcome acknowledged. I bring with me ... the Mighty One.
The Why of Fry,Fry, Eh?
The Why of Fry,Ken," At last, our centuries upon centuries of waiting have achieved fruition."
The Why of Fry,Fry, Aw! Aren't you a fuzzy wittle guy?
The Why of Fry,Ken," Stop that! Uh, please. Your Mightiness--"
The Why of Fry,Fry, Mightiness? Are you off your nut? I just got kidnapped by a bunch of guinea pigs.
The Why of Fry,Ken, Does he not know?
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, He does not know.
The Why of Fry,Fiona, He knows not?
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, Knows not does he.
The Why of Fry,Nibblonian, Not he know--
The Why of Fry,Ken," Enough! Fry, it is my duty to inform you that the fate of humanity, the fate of our race, indeed the fate of all that exists and ever will exist rests with you. You are the single most important person in the universe."
The Why of Fry,Fry," Oh, snap!"
The Why of Fry,Nibbler," On this auspicious occasion, let the horn of eternity cut a thunderous blast."
The Why of Fry,Fiona, The Feast of a Thousand Beasts is begun.
The Why of Fry,Nibblonian, You gonna eat that?
The Why of Fry,Fry, Maybe later.
The Why of Fry,Ken, The time has come to discuss matters of the gravest importance.
The Why of Fry,Nibbler," Fry, do you remember some months ago when the Earth was attacked by flying brains?"
The Why of Fry,Fry, Hmm. I remember the square-dancing stomachs. Although that might have been a Mylanta commercial. Wait! The brains! I do remember! But no one else does. They said I was crazy.
The Why of Fry,Ken, On the contrary. You remember because you were the only one immune to the Brains' mental attack.
The Why of Fry,Fry, Because I'm so smart?
The Why of Fry,Ken," Oh, my. Anyway, your immunity is due to the fact that you lack the delta brainwave. [He presses a button and an image of Fry trying to eat a pineapple on a rope comes up on the screen.] It's a genetic abnormality which resulted when you went back in time and performed certain actions which made you your own grandfather."
The Why of Fry,Fry, I did do the nasty in the past-y!
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, Verily. And that past nastification is what shields you from the brains. You are the last hope of the universe.
The Why of Fry,Fry, So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?
The Why of Fry,Ken, Yes. Except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.
The Why of Fry,Nibbler," For a thousand years, the evil Brains have been constructing the Infosphere, a giant memory bank twice the size of three ordinary memory banks."
The Why of Fry,Fry, What's so evil about that?
The Why of Fry,Fiona, They plan to collect all the information in the universe and store it in the sphere.
The Why of Fry,Fry, So they're trying to learn things?
The Why of Fry,Fiona, Right.
The Why of Fry,Fry, Those bastards!
The Why of Fry,Nibbler," Being Brains, they feel compelled to know everything. And soon they will."
The Why of Fry,Fry, I'm as mad as I've ever been.
The Why of Fry,Ken," Once their task is complete, they will ensure that no new information arises in the only way possible  By destroying the universe."
The Why of Fry,Fry, Now it's personal.
The Why of Fry,Fiona," Your mission is to infiltrate the Infosphere and plant this quantum-interface bomb, blasting them into an alternate universe from which there is no return."
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, Then outrun the blast on this Scooty-Puff Jr.
The Why of Fry,Fry," OK, let's go through this once more--"
The Why of Fry,Fry, Brains!
The Why of Fry,Ken," [on screen] Fear not, Mighty One. Your missing brainwave makes you invisible to them, so long as you avoid intense thinking."
The Why of Fry,Fry," Sorry, what? I wasn't paying attention."
The Why of Fry,Ken, [on screen] That is most wise.
The Why of Fry,Fry, Who?
The Why of Fry,Ken," [on screen] In a few seconds, the Brain will finish scanning the last bits of information in the universe."
The Why of Fry,Infosphere," [scanning data] Beavers mate for life; 11 greater than 4; for quality carpets, visit Kaplan's carpet warehouse."
The Why of Fry,Ken," [on screen] Now the Infosphere will open its protective crust so as to scan itself, completing its thousand year task."
The Why of Fry,Fiona, [on screen] This is your one chance to enter the sphere. Scoot! Scoot now!
The Why of Fry,Fry, I'm at the input console. I'm a little nervous and I've got brain in my buttcrack.
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, [on screen] Roger.
The Why of Fry,Ken," [on screen] Once you press the detonator, you will have 60 seconds for an exciting escape."
The Why of Fry,Fry," Hey, wait. This brain knows everything about everything, right?"
The Why of Fry,Ken, [on screen] It will soon. That's why you're supposed to be setting off a bomb.
The Why of Fry,Fry," Yeah, yeah. But I can't pass up a chance to learn the answers to the greatest questions of all time. [He speaks into the console.] Is it true that postage stamp glue is made of--"
The Why of Fry,Huge Brain, Correct. Toad mucus.
The Why of Fry,Ken, [on screen] There's no time for this. Activate the bomb.
The Why of Fry,Fry," Wait, wait, wait. [He speaks into the console.] What really killed the dinosaurs?"
The Why of Fry,Huge Brain, Me!
The Why of Fry,Computer Voice, Unauthorized data access.
The Why of Fry,Fry, Uh-oh!
The Why of Fry,Big Brain, Detecting trace amounts of mental activity. Possibly a dead weasel or a cartoon viewer.
The Why of Fry,Fry, Ew! Gross. Cut it out!
The Why of Fry,Brain #1, Odd. He is immune to our psionic attack.
The Why of Fry,Brain #2, Impossible! We're an ambitious young squad with everything to prove.
The Why of Fry,Big Brain," It appears we are in the presence of the fabled one. But without his Scooty-Puff Jr., he cannot escape. [It chuckles. Fry picks up the bomb.] Huh?"
The Why of Fry,Brain #2, A quantum-interface bomb? Are you insane in the membrane?
The Why of Fry,Fry," You got it, poindexter!"
The Why of Fry,Brain #1," Oh, not good!"
The Why of Fry,Computer Voice, Detonation in T-60 Earth seconds.
The Why of Fry,Brain #3, You fool! You'll be transported to the other universe with us. Trapped there for all eternity.
The Why of Fry,Brain #1, And we'll form a tightly-knit clique that you won't be part of!
The Why of Fry,Fry, Well at least I did one important thing with my life  Leading good to victory over evil!
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, [on screen] Yay!
The Why of Fry,Ken, [on screen] Exactly!
The Why of Fry,Big Brain," The Nibblonians? Good? Ha! During your last moments in this universe perhaps you should query our database concerning the night of December 31st, 1999."
The Why of Fry,Fry, The day I got frozen? What about it?
The Why of Fry,Nibbler," [on screen] No! Don't ask about that! It-It would be, uh ... boring!"
The Why of Fry,Fry," Ah, forget it then."
The Why of Fry,Big Brain, Query!
The Why of Fry,Fry," OK! Sheesh! What happened to me, Philip J. Fry, on the night of December 31st, 1999?"
The Why of Fry,Huge Brain, Clarification request  Are you the Philip J. Fry from Earth or the Philip J. Fry from Hovering Squidworld 97A?
The Why of Fry,Big Brain," Earth, you fat idiot! Hurry up!"
The Why of Fry,Fry," [on screen] Hello? Pizza delivery for ... [He reads the note.] ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud!"
The Why of Fry,Fry," Eurgh! I can't believe how fat I look! [On the screen, Fry blows his noise maker and leans back on his chair. Nibbler walks out from underneath the desk.] Aw, Nibbler's there. Wait! What?"
The Why of Fry,Fry, [on screen] What the--
The Why of Fry,Fry, I-- I don't understand. You made me go in the freezer tube?
The Why of Fry,Computer Voice, Detonation in T-15 seconds.
The Why of Fry,Fry, You little runts froze me! You took away my life!
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, [on screen] We can explain!
The Why of Fry,Fry," No, you can't. Shut your adorable trap!"
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, [on screen] We had no choice. You were the only one who could help us. What is one life weighed against the entire universe?
The Why of Fry,Fry, [crying] But it was my life.
The Why of Fry,Computer Voice," Detonation in two, one. Will the owner of a white Pontiac Firebird-- Oh, never mind. Zero!"
The Why of Fry,Big Brain," Well, here we are. Trapped for eternity."
The Why of Fry,Brain #2, We could sing American Pie.
The Why of Fry,Fry, Go ahead. I deserve it. I wish those stupid racoons had never brought me to the future.
The Why of Fry,Huge Brain, I have shocking data relevant to this conversation.
The Why of Fry,Big Brain," We don't care, you dope! We're in another universe. You're not in charge anymore."
The Why of Fry,Huge Brain," It is possible for the Philip Fry to resume his life on December 31st, 1999."
The Why of Fry,Fry, Really? I can go back in time?
The Why of Fry,Huge Brain, There is a nexus point between universes at the space-time where you entered the cryogenic tube. You and only you can return there.
The Why of Fry,Big Brain, Interesting. You could stop the Nibblonian from pushing you into the cryogenic tube.
The Why of Fry,Fry, That is interesting. Why?
The Why of Fry,Big Brain, It would be as if you never came to the future. You will have your life back and we will succeed in our plan to understand and destroy the universe.
The Why of Fry,Fry, Everybody wins!
The Why of Fry,Brain #2, The human will be returned to the past!
The Why of Fry,Narrator, [voice-over] Meanwhile.
The Why of Fry,Leela, I love rocket skating! But the wait is always so long. Poor Fry once stood in line for six hours just to get me a ticket.
The Why of Fry,Chaz, Six hours? Pft! Sounds like a real nobody! But now it's time for somebody and some chick he's with to go skating.
The Why of Fry,Leela, You reserved the whole rink?
The Why of Fry,Chaz," Yup. Buzzed ahead, let 'em know whose aide was coming by. The mayor's, that's whose."
The Why of Fry,Leela," Oh, Chaz!"
The Why of Fry,Sally," Mr. Vogel, I thought we was going skating."
The Why of Fry,Vogel," No, we're not important enough. Everybody just hold hands until the bus driver comes back from his haircut."
The Why of Fry,Leela," Aw, let's let those kids skate with us."
The Why of Fry,Chaz, What? Seriously? I'm trying to impress you with my clout here.
The Why of Fry,Leela," I know, and it's working. But think how much skating would mean to those kids."
The Why of Fry,Nina, We came here instead of eating today.
The Why of Fry,Leela, This may be their only chance to skate in their whole lives. Who are we to say they can't?
The Why of Fry,Chaz," The mayor's aide, and his badge. [shouting] Beat it, kids! Come back when you got connections!"
The Why of Fry,Vogel," Alright, little ones, back to the orphanarium. You can slide around the gym in your socks."
The Why of Fry,Sally, What socks?
The Why of Fry,Chaz, So am I gonna get lucky tonight or what?
The Why of Fry,Fry, I hope your calculations are correct.
The Why of Fry,Big Brain, Our calculations are always correct. For we are gigantic brains.
The Why of Fry,Brain #2, Initiate space-time transfer.
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, I hereby place an order for one cheese pizza.
The Why of Fry,Panucci," [on phone] One pie, nothing good on it. Name?"
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, I-period-C-period-Wiener.
The Why of Fry,Panucci," [on phone] Uh, talk a little louder. It sounds like you got some kind of tiny head on you or something."
The Why of Fry,Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for, uh ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud!"
The Why of Fry,Fry, Gotcha!
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, I don't understand.
The Why of Fry,Fry," Yes, you do! You came back in time to knock me into that freezer and now I came back in time to stop you."
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, I did not come back in time. My people lack that ability.
The Why of Fry,Fry, But ... I know you in the future. I-I cleaned your poop.
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. You will meet me when I'm a thousand years older.
The Why of Fry,Fry, Not if you don't freeze me.
The Why of Fry,Nibbler," Please. Our saviours foresee that in a thousand years, for one moment, the fate of the universe will depend on you. Since you will not live that long I must freeze you now."
The Why of Fry,Fry," Well, why couldn't you just ask me?"
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, We were afraid you would refuse.
The Why of Fry,Fry, Of course not. I love the future.
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, Then why are you choking me right now?
The Why of Fry,Fry, Because I don't like being used.
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, Well now it's your choice. Is there nothing in the future worth saving?
The Why of Fry,Fry, Hm. Leela. But she doesn't think much of me.
The Why of Fry,Nibbler," Ah, she must be The Other."
The Why of Fry,Fry, What?
The Why of Fry,Nibbler," You must not give up on her. I am stationed on a distant world known as Vergon 6. But, if you return to the future, I will transfer to Earth to give you what help I can."
The Why of Fry,Crowd," [chanting; from outside] Ten, nine, eight, seven..."
The Why of Fry,Fry, You really think I would have had a chance with Leela?
The Why of Fry,Nibbler, You must choose  The present or the future? To save yourself or to save Leela.
The Why of Fry,Crowd, [chanting; from outside] One.
The Why of Fry,Fry," Yes! Here I come, future! Oh, no! Wait! I'm gonna get trapped in the Infosphere again! Just remember that Scooty-Puff Jr. sucks."
The Why of Fry,Nibbler," In a thousand years, I'll get right on it."
The Why of Fry,Narrator," [voice-over] And so, a thousand years later, Fry once again infiltrated the Infosphere and set off his amazing bomb. Only this time..."
The Why of Fry,Nibbler," Thank you for saving the universe, Fry. [He picks a flower and hands it to Fry.] Here."
The Why of Fry,Fry," Whoa, thanks! If you ever need a saviour again, just ask."
The Why of Fry,Nibbler," Oh, we will. We will."
The Why of Fry,Fry," Man, I can't wait to tell everyone what happened."
The Why of Fry,Nibbler," Uh, yes. Incidentally, I need to remain undercover so I'm blanking your memory."
The Why of Fry,Fry," Huh. Did everything just taste purple for a second? Oh, well. Let's go home, you dumb poop machine."
The Why of Fry,Leela," Bender, would you do the honours?"
The Why of Fry,Bender, With gusto.
The Why of Fry,Fry," Hey, Leela. I guess I got this for you."
The Why of Fry,Leela," Oh. Thank you. You know what, Fry? I don't care if you're not the most important person in the universe. It really makes me happy to see you right now."
The Why of Fry,Fry, Then I am the most important person in the universe.
The Why of Fry,Fry, [over credits] Yes!
The Why of Fry,,
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner," [voice-over] Shatner's log, airdate ... unknown."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner," The impossible has happened. It would take days to recount the events I have witnessed. So, settle in. It all began--"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Zapp," Quiet, you! This court martial is now in session. The honourably sexy Zapp Brannigan residing. Bring in the accused."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Takei," Oh, my!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Zapp," Philip J. Fry, you stand accused of travelling to the forbidden planet, Omega 3, a crime punishable by 12 concurrent death sentences. Do you understand the charges?"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Kif," One beep for ""yes"", two beeps for ""no""."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Zapp," ""Yes"". So noted. Do you plead guilty? [Fry beeps twice.] Double ""yes"". Guilty! I will now carry out the punishment. Kif, my gun."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela," Wait! He pled ""not guilty""."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Zapp," Order! [He taps a bell.] Order in the court! Very well then, Mr. Fry. Please recount the events that led you to be guilty."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela," The Professor said he was taking a brief nap, so we only have time for six movies."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender, Let's take these six Jim Carrey movies and record over them.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, You know what movies average out to be really good? The first six Star Trek movies!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Clerk, [shouting] Everybody hit the deck!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, [whispering] Sh! Those words are forbidden!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, What words? Star Trek?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, Sh!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Zoidberg, Shut your gills!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender, That sound! It's patrol car 718! Hide him!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Zapp, The court is intrigued. Perhaps we could hear more about these forbidden words from someone with a sexily seductive voice.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Takei," With pleasure. You see, the show was banned after the Star Trek wars."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Zapp, You mean the vast migration of Star Wars fans?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nichols," No, that was the Star Wars trek. [Some mechanical hands come out of her jar, pick up a video tape and put it in the VCR.] By the 23rd century, Star Trek fandom had evolved from a loose association of nerds with skin problems into a full-blown religion."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Priest, [on TV] And Scotty beamed them to the Klingon ship where they would be no Tribble at all.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Congregation, [chanting; on TV] All power to the engines.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nichols," As country after country fell under its influence, world leaders became threatened by the movements power. [In Berlin a sign is unveiled saying ""Welcome To Nazi Planet Episode Land. Formerly Germany"".] And so the Trekkies were executed in the manner most befitting virgins."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Man," [on TV] He's dead, Jim! [They throw another in.] He's dead, Jim! [Another.] He's dead, Jim!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nichols," Finally, the sacred texts were banned."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Takei," The last copies of the 79 episodes and six movies were dumped on the forbidden world, Omega 3, along with that blooper reel where the door doesn't close all the way."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy," Thus, Star Trek was forever scoured from human memory."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender, Another classic science-fiction show cancelled before its time.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Zapp, I've never heard of such a brutal and shocking injustice that I cared so little about. Next witness.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Kif," Bender the robot, please take the stand."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," She's all yours, buddy!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender," I'd only met the defendant, Fry, once, but I knew he was up to no good."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Zapp, Please use the beeps.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," Mr. Nimoy, I came as soon as I heard what happened centuries ago. I can't believe your show was banned."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy, I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," You know. 1966? 79 episodes, about 30 good ones."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy," Oh, really, I've done too many things to remember one particular TV series. But if-if you want to discuss my books of poetry--"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, Come on! Remember that episode where you got high on spores and smacked Kirk around?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy," No. Perhaps you're thinking of my one man show about Vincent van Spock-- Uh, uh, I mean van Gogh! Damn!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, Aha! You can't escape it!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy," [crying] Oh, you're right, I can't."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," Uh, jeez, don't get upset. I mean, OK, I outwitted you, but--"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy," [crying] No, it's my fellow cast members. 300 years ago they left Earth behind."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner," This planet doesn't appreciate us anymore, Leonard."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy," Bill, you are, and always shall be, my friend. But I just signed a six-month lease on my apartment. I can't walk away from a commitment like that."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner," Very well, my friend."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy, [crying] Why did the world turn it's back on our obvious greatness?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, I'm literally angry with rage! Your co-stars may be gone but we can still get those episode tapes back for the whole world to see. Come on!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy, Oh!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Frakes, Yes! Front row!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, You can't go to Omega 3; it's forbidden! I forbid you!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, But we have to! The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, But it's set 800 years in the past!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender," Yeah, why is this so important to you?"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," 'Cause it-it taught me so much. Like how you should accept people, whether they be black, white, Klingon or even female. But most importantly, when I didn't have any friends, it made me feel like maybe I did."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela," Well, that is touchingly pathetic. I guess I can't let you go alone."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender," I'll go too, with Leonard's permission, of course."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, We're entering the Omega system.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Computer Voice, Warning  You are now in forbidden space.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender," Forbidden shmer-shmidden! What are they gonna do, write a letter? [sarcastic] Ooh, I'm so scared!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, I've lost control of the ship!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," Oh, dip!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy," Dip, indeed!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, It's all stuff from that forbidden show.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy," So many cardboard sets, so many memories. If only the others--"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner, I guess that's my cue.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy, Bill!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner, L-Dog!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy, [laughing] Hey! This is wonderful!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner," Oh, man."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy, I feel like hugging you.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner, Well I would except you have no body! [Nimoy laughs.] And we're both men.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy, Nichelle! George! Walter! DeForest! [A token redshirt steps out.] Welshie!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, Welshie?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nichols, We did some musical reunion specials in the 2200's but the guy who played Scotty had trouble yodelling.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Takei," Ever since then, Welshie has been a welcome participant in our escapades."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, I can't believe it! How'd you all end up here?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner," We were on our way to Welshie's cousin's house to stay in the guest room when our ship was pulled down to this planet and crashed, just like yours."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Koenig," When we woke up, we had these bodies."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, Say it in Russian!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Koenig, Ven vee voke up vee had these wodies.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," Now say ""nuclear wessels""!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Koenig, No!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Takei," You'll love it here. Everything is provided for us, and we never age. Check out these abs!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender, Yowza!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, But who's doing all this for you?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner," You know, we never thought about it. We're famous celebrities -- we're used to this sort of treatment."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar, It is I!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender, Whoa! What a cheesy effect!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar, I am not an effect! You doubt my power?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender, I do.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Welshie, [shouting] Aye!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, [screaming] Welshie!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Zapp," This court will now hear some very sensual testimony from this court's ex-lover, Turanga Leela."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, Go [beep] yourself.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar," Behold another power, different from the one you saw earlier."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy," Hey, a body! Buff, tan. Yeah, this is mine, alright!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," Alright, you gas, what's the deal?"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar," Centuries ago, the videotaped adventures of the Enterprise crew rained down upon my planet. Over and over, I watched them. Especially the five with the energy beings. I am Melllvar! Seer of the tapes, knower of the episodes! Tremble before my encyclopaedic knowledge of Star Trek!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, Tremble? I laugh. Nobody knows more about Star Trek than me!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar," I beg to differ. [He zaps Welshie some more.] Long have I waited for the one who played Spock. At last, we can begin."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, Cool! A Star Trek convention!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy," Uh, Melllvar, can you give us some idea of how long this is going to last?"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar, Until time stops.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, What?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner, He can't do this!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy, You can't be serious!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar," Now, we have a full schedule of events--"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender," Uh, can people who hate Star Trek leave?"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Koenig, Good question!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar," No, you have to stay even longer."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar," Um, uh, sign it to Melllvar. ""Melllvar"" has three ""L's""."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Takei," I think I've done enough conventions to know how to spell ""Melllvar""."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender," Say ""nerd""!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,All, Nerd!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner," [spoken-word] I'm Slim Shady,"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,"Yes, I'm the real Shady,",
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,"All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating,",
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,"So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,",
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,"Please stand up,",
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Please stand up.,
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Koenig, How can you do a spoken-word version of a rap song?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar, He found a way.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, For one hundred quatloos  Who did the captain maroon on Ceti Alpha V?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner, [shouting] Khaaan!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, Uh ... Khan?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, Correct.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar," My button has broken. The trivia contest has ended. I-I now have a surprise. You will perform a fan script, written by the ultimate Trek fan."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, You have my fan script?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar, I meant me! Melllvar is the ultimate fan!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," [smug] Oh, I was confused because the scoreboard says something different."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar," Trivia contest over! Take your scripts! [The actors run to a pile of scripts.] We have limited rehearsal time. Now, I didn't make enough copies of the script, so George and Walter will have to share."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela," Uh, you probably don't want us to see you rehearsing, or it'll give away the ending."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar, That's right! The ending must not be ruined.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, We'll go wait in the ship.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar, OK.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, Not till I get my 600 quatloos!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, This is wrong. We shouldn't have abandoned them there.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender," I dunno, I'm feeling pretty good about it."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela," I didn't wanna leave them either, Fry, but what are we supposed to do?"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," Well, usually on the show someone would come up with a complicated plan then explain it with a simple analogy."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela," Hmm. If we can re-route engine power through the primary weapons and reconfigure them to Melllvar's frequency, that should overload his electro-quantum structure."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender, Like putting too much air in a balloon!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, Of course! It's so simple!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner," [reading] Alas, my ship, whom I love like a woman, is ... disabled. [He slumps back in his chair and rolls his head.] Oh, Lord!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy," [reading] Fascinating, Captain, and logical too, that we need some help."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Takei," [reading] Look, Captain, Melllvar will help us."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Koenig," [reading] Keptin, I wope he will welp our ... vessel."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar, Wessel! [Koenig shudders.] You're not acting hard enough!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy," Melllvar, you have to respect your actors. When I directed Star Trek IV I got a magnificent performance out of Bill because I respected him so much."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner," And when I directed Star Trek V I got a magnificent performance out of me, because I respected me so much!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender, [shouting] OK! I'm done re-kafoobling the energy motron ... or whatever.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, Fire!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nichols," [reading] My, what a handsome energy creature you are. I love you. [The orange beams converge on Melllvar and he screams.] Hey, you wrote it!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, It's not working! He's drawing straight from our weapons.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, Like a balloon and ... something bad happens.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender, Yup!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela," So, uh, how's rehearsal going?"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar," Lousy. Here I've been admiring a bunch of actors while you, a crew of genuine space heroes, risked your lives to save them."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy, Hey! We've done heroic things too.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nichols, Yeah! In the third season I kissed Shatner!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar, Silence! My whole world has turned upside-down. I have but one option.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Koenig, Keep them and let us go?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar, No! To determine who is more worthy of my fanatical devotion I shall pit you together against each other in armed combat ... to the death!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender, Where'd you get an idiotic idea like that?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar," Episodes 19, 46, 56 and 77."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," Great list. Except, you forgot episode 66!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar, I was getting to that one!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Zapp, So Melllvar ordered a battle to the death. I assume no one survived.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, Can we get on with this? My foot's getting tired!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar," This will be your standard battle to the death. The only weapons  Whatever you can find. But I warn you, do nothing until I have signalled the start of combat. OK, start."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Koenig, I don't have much experience at fighting -- except with you guys.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner, I have an idea. Wasn't there an episode where I threw my shoe at the enemy?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy, You mean Doohan?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner," Whoever it was, I did it like this."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Takei, Ow!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner, My foot's cold!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, There. We can make these into spears.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, And we can tie these caterpillars together to make bow strings for bows and arrows.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender, And we can use this machine gun to shoot them! Yee-haw! [He pulls out a Tommy gun from behind a rock and expends the entire round. Fry and Leela glare at him and he chuckles.] That was fun!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nichols, What if I distract them with my famous fan dance?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner," Oh, that's good, good, good, good. And then, George, you give them a karate chop!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Takei, I find that offensive. Just because I'm of Japanese ancestry you assume I know karate. Have I ever led you to believe I've studied karate?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner," Well, no, but you never talk about yourself."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Takei, [sad] Maybe if you showed a little interest.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," Well, here goes nothing."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nichols," [sexfully] Hello, boys!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender, Whoa!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Takei, Hi-yah!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner, There's no right way to hit a woman.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, Then do it the wrong way.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner, Fine. Yah!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, Is that all you've got? Hi-yah!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner, See you in h--
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender," Come on, Walter!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy, Take that!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, It hurts!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy," Let's see if this actually works! [He tries to do the Vulcan neck pinch on Bender but it doesn't work.] Hm. [Bender punches him, grabs his legs and swings him around, whacking the others in the face.] Ow! Ow! Ow!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Koenig, My face!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Takei, Ow! My face too!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner, May I? [Leela grabs him and throws him over her head.] Oh!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar, Excellent! Excellent!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner," Leela, please. This is exactly what Melllvar wants. We're just pawns in his diabolical game of checkers. Can't we resolve our differences some other way?"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar's Mother, Melllvar! Dinner time!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar," Aw, but Mom, I'm playing with my collectables!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar's Mother, Now!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," All this time we thought he was a powerful super-being, yet he was just a child."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar's Mother," He's not a child, he's 34!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender," Alright, Koenig, I've wanted to do this for years!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," Bender, wait! This is our chance to escape, before Melllvar comes back. But we all need to work together."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner, I love you so much!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy, Hello?
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, We've decided to work together.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy," Uh, so did they."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner," Now, how do we escape?"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, We can't use our ship; we have life support but the engines are wrecked.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Takei," Ironic, because our engines work but our life support systems don't."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela," Hey, if your engines work--"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Takei, And your life support systems work--
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," Stop! You're just goin' around in circles! [to himself] Think, Fry, think! Everyone's depending on you."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela," We're too heavy. You guys need to lose some weight, fast!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," Look, Leonard, we're light enough to keep the tapes! Isn't that great?"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy, I'm living in a gefilte fish jar.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, We did it!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, Melllvar's got a spaceship!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar," [on screen] Yes, in mint condition. And you made me take it out of the package!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, The Nimbus! We're saved!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Zapp, [on screen] You're under arrest. Prepare to be boarded.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Zapp," So I boarded you, eh? What happened next?"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela," You started this stupid court martial. Now if you don't mind, we're still fighting Melllvar!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Leela, One more hit and we're done for!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Takei," Let's take 'em out with us. Do you guys have a self-destruct code? Like ""destruct sequence 1-A, 2-B, 3--"""
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Bender," Thanks a lot, Takei, now everybody knows!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar," [on screen] If I can't have the original cast of Star Trek, no one will! Prepare to die!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," Wait! If they mean that much to you, why do you wanna kill them?"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar, [on screen] Because I ... I ... I dunno what I'd do without them.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," Melllvar, you can't let a TV show be your whole life. You can do anything you want. Look at Walter Koenig  After Star Trek, he became an actor."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Koenig," Not just an actor, but a well-rounded person, with my own friends and credit cards and keys."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar," [on screen] Well, I guess I could move out of my parents' basement ... maybe get a temp job."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," Whoa, whoa! One step at a time."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar," [on screen] I thank you, Fry. You know, you and I are of a kind. In a different reality I could have called you ""friend""."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry," Episode 10, Balance of Terror."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Melllvar," [on screen] More like episode nine, loser! In your face! Victory is mine!"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner," I wonder, my friends, was he really such an evil energy gas?"
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nichols, He did give us eternal youth.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Koenig, 24-hour Laundromat.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Takei," A full assortment of rum, both spiced and regular."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Nimoy," Truly, it was a paradise."
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Fry, And all you had to put up with was one really annoying Star Trek fan.
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,Shatner, Let's get the hell outta here!
Where No Fan Has Gone Before,,
The Sting,Bender," A hush comes over the crowd. The only sound is Bender calling everyone else a jerk as he swings! [He hits the ball and it interacts with the screen, landing in the lake.] Oh, he slices! Into the water! Oh, man! [He plugs a cable into his head and appears on the screen.] [muttering] Boy, I tell you, buddy!"
The Sting,Farnsworth," Bad news, everyone. You're not good enough to go on your next mission."
The Sting,Fry, Hooray!
The Sting,Bender, Not good enough!
The Sting,Leela, Why? Says who?
The Sting,Farnsworth, Because. And says me. It's an extremely dangerous mission that killed my last crew. And you're not nearly as good as them.
The Sting,Fry, Woo-hoo!
The Sting,Bender, We live to suck another day!
The Sting,Leela, We're just as good as any of those other crews you sent to their deaths. What's the mission?
The Sting,Farnsworth, Collecting honey. Ordinary honey.
The Sting,Leela, That doesn't sound so dangerous.
The Sting,Farnsworth, This is no ordinary honey! It's produced by vicious space bees. A single sting of their hideous neuro-toxin can cause instant death.
The Sting,Hermes," And that's if you're not allergic. You don't wanna know what happens then. Oh, no, no. God, no!"
The Sting,Farnsworth, Your insides will boil out of your eye sockets like a science fair volcano.
The Sting,Hermes, I didn't want to know!
The Sting,Farnsworth, These bees are larger than most Buicks and twice as ugly.
The Sting,Fry, Larger than an American sedan? [He gasps.] How big is the honeycomb?
The Sting,Hermes," Honeycomb's big. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
The Sting,Bender, It's not small?
The Sting,Hermes," No, no, no."
The Sting,Leela," It'll take more than deadly, deadly bees to keep us from doing our job. Come on, boys."
The Sting,Fry," But, Leela, we're no good."
The Sting,Leela," Listen, I'm scared too. But I'm more scared of disappointing myself."
The Sting,Fry, I'm not scared of that at all.
The Sting,Leela," Now, bees communicate by dancing."
The Sting,Fry," Like my parents! Oh, wait, that was hitting."
The Sting,Leela, So this language cartridge will let you distract them.
The Sting,Bender," Ah, good. I often have thoughts and feelings that can only be expressed through dance. [He dances.] [in bee] You stink. Bender's great. Deal with it."
The Sting,Leela," Bender, quick! Waggle something!"
The Sting,Bender," Uh ... [in bee] Hello, fellow bees. How's the abdomen? Swollen with nectar, I trust?"
The Sting,Bee, [in bee] Duh!
The Sting,Fry," Leela, let's turn back. There's absolutely no shame in wussing out."
The Sting,Leela, Relax. Everything'll be fine.
The Sting,Fry," Oh, my God! The old Planet Express ship."
The Sting,Leela, There's the black box.
The Sting,Man," [on tape] Captain, the bees have us surrounded! Oh, the Professor was right. We're not as good as his old crew!"
The Sting,Captain," [on tape] Well I aim to prove him wrong. It'll take more than a few deadly, deadly bees to-- [The buzzing gets louder.] [screaming] OH, LORD!!"
The Sting,Leela," Uh, couldn't make that out. Too much static."
The Sting,Bender, Ew!
The Sting,Leela, We found it! The honeycomb hideout.
The Sting,Fry," Hey, what's this goop?"
The Sting,Leela, Royal jelly. They feed it to the queen.
The Sting,Fry," Bees make honey and jelly? Huh. How come nothing humans make tastes good? [The honeycomb underneath him gives way and he falls into the jelly. He screams.] Help! I can't swim in jelly, as far as I know!"
The Sting,Leela," Look! [A small bee floats towards them on the jelly.] It's a baby queen! Aw, she's so cute! You adorable wittle, itty-bitty, fuzzy-wuzzy--"
The Sting,Fry, Leela! Stop bonding and let's go! I got jelly in my underpants!
The Sting,Leela, I'm taking this bee with us. With a queen we can build a hive and make more honey ourselves. Let me just pack her a lunch and we'll go.
The Sting,Bender," [in bee] Pick up the pace, lady! I'm sick of shaking my booty for these fat jerks. [The bees glare at Bender, who quickly realises his mistake.] I didn't mean you're all fat. Just fatso there."
The Sting,Bee, [in bee] He insulted our fat queen!
The Sting,Queen," [in bee] You try keeping your figure after 10,000 kids!"
The Sting,Leela, This is where we distinguish ourselves from the last crew. Activate emergency high-speed self-contained escape pack crisis response unit. Quick!
The Sting,Leela," [shouting] Good luck, Bender!"
The Sting,Bender," I'm back, baby!"
The Sting,Fry, We made it! We're alive!
The Sting,Leela, Burn on that old crew! The only things they did better than us were suck and die!
The Sting,Fry," Leela, we got lucky this time. But you should be more careful. I don't want anything to happen to you."
The Sting,Leela," Thanks, but I can look out for myself. Frankly, I can smell danger a mile away."
The Sting,Fry," Look out! [Leela screams and the bee flies at her. Fry steps in front of her.] You want her, you're gonna have to go through me!"
The Sting,Leela," You call that a wound? That's a boo-boo tops. But thanks for trying to save me, Fry. [There is no response.] [alarmed] Fry?! [Fry is hunched over on the floor, clutching where the sting hit him. Leela gasps.] He's... he's dead!"
The Sting,Bender, [crying] Who will make Bender waffles just the way he likes them now?
The Sting,Leela, [crying] It was all my fault! He died because of me!
The Sting,Farnsworth," [Farnsworth begins patting her on the hand in a comforting manner.] No, no, no, no, no, no. [He turns to Bender.] [shouting] I'm lying to make her feel better!"
The Sting,LaBarbara," Husband, can't you go anywhere without lighting something up?"
The Sting,Hermes, It's an old Jamaican accounting tradition. We burn his timecard. That way his zombie doesn't come back looking for his final paycheck.
The Sting,Amy, He looks so natural. It's funny to think he's clammed full of sawdust and preservatives.
The Sting,Zoidberg, I only wish I could have removed the stinger.
The Sting,Changstein el Gamahl," I barely knew Philip. But, as a clergyman, I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him."
The Sting,Hermes, Soothe us with sweet lies.
The Sting,Changstein el Gamahl, It may comfort you to know Fry's death took only 15 seconds. Yet the pain was so intense that it felt to him like 15 years. And it goes without saying it caused him to empty his bowels. [Everyone gasps.] We now commend Fry's body to the ages.
The Sting,Amy, He's walking on sunshine now.
The Sting,Farnsworth, This makes me the oldest member of my family.
The Sting,Kug, Him do good snu-snu.
The Sting,Bender," All those times I said ""Kill all humans,"" I'd always whisper ""except one"". Fry was that one. [sobbing] And I never told him so!"
The Sting,Terry," [melodramatically] Farewell, from the world of tomorrow!"
The Sting,Leela," [softly crying] They say a spoonful of space honey helps ease the pain. [She picks up a box marked ""Memories of Fry"" and takes out a collectible spoon from when he was the Trisolian Emperor. She dips it into the jar and eats the honey and begins to become a little light-hearted.] Mmm... It's good. [She eats some more and stops crying.] I feel funny. Ha-ha funny!"
The Sting,Fry, Leela?
The Sting,Leela, Fry? I thought you were dead.
The Sting,Fry," Nope, I'm better than ever. Before the accident I couldn't do this!"
The Sting,Leela, Impressive! But it does sorta support my you-are-dead theory.
The Sting,Fry," Then I'll prove I'm alive, by telling you something only I could know. [A large, translucent image of him appears behind him and Leela and they both speak.] There's a surprise for you in my locker. I got it at a Swedish novelty shop before we left."
The Sting,Leela, It's too beautiful to open. Can I open it?
The Sting,Fry, Sure. There's just one thing I want you to do.
The Sting,Leela, What?
The Sting,Fry, I want you to wake up.
The Sting,Leela, Wake up? But I'm not--
The Sting,Leela, In my dream Fry said he hid a gift for me in his locker. If it's true then he must still exist in some form.
The Sting,Farnsworth," Of course he still exists  As a frozen corpse in outer space! [He laughs then sighs.] Oh, I made myself sad."
The Sting,Leela," Well, here goes."
The Sting,Zoidberg, Bupkis!
The Sting,Bender," Well, I feel better now. Pawning all the stuff in Fry's locker helped give me closure."
The Sting,Leela, Was there anything in there that might have been a gift for me?
The Sting,Bender," No. Nothing. Not at all. No way, José! [He opens his chest cabinet and takes out the same gift from Leela's dream.] Here it is."
The Sting,Leela, You took this from Fry's locker?
The Sting,Bender," Hey, the guy's dead! There's no law against grave robbing."
The Sting,Leela, That proves it. Fry is alive somewhere and he's reaching me in my dreams.
The Sting,Farnsworth, Bull pies!
The Sting,Farnsworth, Lay down here and we'll do some tests. If Fry is out there then Leela's brain could be acting as a five-pound Ouija board.
The Sting,Leela, Is this some sort of brain scanner?
The Sting,Farnsworth," Some sort, yes. In France it's called a guillotine."
The Sting,Leela, Professor! Can't you examine my brain without removing it?
The Sting,Farnsworth," Yes, easily."
The Sting,Bender," Hey, what if Fry wasn't actually dead when we buried him? Y'know like Julia Roberts?"
The Sting,Farnsworth," Well, I suppose there's a slim-- [The scanner dings and he gasps.] I don't believe it!"
The Sting,Leela, What is it? Is Fry alive in some other dimension or something?
The Sting,Farnsworth," No. According to this gizmometer, Fry is dead and nothing can bring him back. Remarkable!"
The Sting,Leela, But ... my dream. Your science can't unprove that! How could I have known the gift was in Fry's locker?
The Sting,Hermes, Easy! He told you about it before he died and your grief-roasted mind blocked it out.
The Sting,Leela, Are you saying I'm going crazy?
The Sting,Farnsworth," No, no! No one's saying that. But I'm certainly thinking it loudly."
The Sting,Fry," Hi, Leela! I'm just gonna keep talking, even if you can't hear me. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
The Sting,Leela, Shut up! I can hear you. The Professor says you're just a dream.
The Sting,Fry," Oh, yeah? [The space around them changes to a purple forest.] Could a dream take you dancing in a Venusian garden?"
The Sting,Leela," Well, yes, technically. But it's still very sweet of you."
The Sting,Fry, Then what if we shared a sleigh ride across the ice fields of Hyperion?
The Sting,Leela," Oh, Fry! You must be alive; I've never been treated so romantically by my own imagination before."
The Sting,Fry," Here, take my jacket. You look a little cold."
The Sting,Leela, Thank you. It's all so beautiful. I forgot how many hundreds of degrees below zero it must be. I just wish I could convince the others you're alive.
The Sting,Fry, You can. All you have to do is wake up.
The Sting,Leela," No, no! Don't say that! This is real!"
The Sting,Leela, Not another dream! [She gasps and drops the sheets from around her. She is wearing Fry's jacket.] Fry's jacket! The one he was buried in! My dream was real! He's alive!
The Sting,Petunia, [from apartment] Quit your bragging! My boyfriend's alive too! [There is a thump.] Not 'nymore!
The Sting,Bender, That's better!
The Sting,Leela, Fry's alive! I have proof!
The Sting,Amy, No way!
The Sting,Farnsworth, You lie!
The Sting,Bender, You do not!
The Sting,Hermes," I'm from Jamaica, the ""Show Me"" island. So show me you're blowing it out your fanny."
The Sting,Leela, But he gave me his jacket. Look.
The Sting,Farnsworth," That's not Fry's jacket. Fry's jacket is red. That's your jacket. An off-the-rack, lime green affair."
The Sting,Leela, But Fry-- His jacket-- And when I woke up it was on me.
The Sting,Hermes," You're under a lot of guilt stress, Leela. Here, work it off."
The Sting,Leela," [squeezing] I am not under stress, damnit!"
The Sting,Amy," [Farnsworth's voice] Everything's going to be alright, Leela."
The Sting,Leela, What?
The Sting,Amy, I said everything's going to be alright.
The Sting,Leela, Oh. Maybe I am freaking out a little.
The Sting,Bender, A little? You're screwier than my Aunt Rita. And she's a screw!
The Sting,Leela, I need to calm down. I'd better take some more of that space honey.
The Sting,Farnsworth," You've been taking space honey? Be careful, you purple-haired imbecile!"
The Sting,Zoidberg, One spoonful calms you down. Two spoonfuls help you sleep. But three spoonfuls and you'll go into a sleep so deep you'll never wake up. Never!
The Sting,Hermes, [Farnsworth's voice] Never!
The Sting,Bender, [Amy's voice] Never!
The Sting,Leela," One spoonful to calm me down. [She swallows it and falls over.] OK, I've got a pretty good calm going! Two spoonfuls to help me sleep. [She eats another one but nothing happens.] Uh-oh, still awake. I guess one more spoonful couldn't hurt. [She swipes at the jar with the spoon but misses and knocks the royal jelly onto the sofa.] Oh, my gosh! I'd better get a sponge. [The jelly forms a Fry-shaped object.] Fry? [She rubs her eye.] Is that you? I don't need a sponge!"
The Sting,Fry, Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?
The Sting,Farnsworth," Incredible! According to the gizmometer, Fry touched the royal jelly in the space hive, leaving an imprint of his DNA and brainwaves. Then, when it spilled on the couch, it recombined with trace amounts of Fry's hair and skin--"
The Sting,Bender, And blood! Don't forget about Fry's blood!
The Sting,Farnsworth," Yes, Bender, thank you. In short, the various fluids Fry left in the couch caused the royal jelly to regenerate his entire being."
The Sting,Fry, Neat!
The Sting,Bender, This is great! My buddy's alive and his credit cards are valid again. [He takes Fry's credit cards out of his chest cabinet.] Let's go get hammered!
The Sting,Zoidberg," I should warn you, I'm a mean drunk."
The Sting,Leela," Fry, I'm so glad I didn't kill you."
The Sting,Fry, Me too.
The Sting,Leela, Feeling responsible for your death was driving me mad. But now everything is alright.
The Sting,Fry," Uh, not everything."
The Sting,Leela, What? What do you mean?
The Sting,Fry, You have to wake up.
The Sting,Leela," Wake up? Oh, no! No! It can't be!"
The Sting,Leela, Pooh!
The Sting,Leela," I'm cracking up. In my dreams I'm happy because Fry is alive. But when I'm awake, my mind plays tricks on me."
The Sting,Hermes," Oh, take it easy, Leela."
The Sting,Amy, In every life we have some trouble.
The Sting,Bender," But when you worry, you make it double."
The Sting,Amy and Bender, [singing] Don't worry! Bee happy!
The Sting,Farnsworth, [singing] The landlord says your rent is late.
The Sting,Hermes, [singing] He might have to litigate.
The Sting,Bender, [singing] But don't worry!
The Sting,Bee, [singing] Bee--
The Sting,Farnsworth, [singing] Happy!
The Sting,Zoidberg," [singing] Ain't got no cash,"
The Sting,"Ain't got no style,",
The Sting,"Ladies vomit when I smile,",
The Sting,But does Zoidberg worry?,
The Sting,Feh! You wish!,
The Sting,Bee, [singing] Bee--
The Sting,Zoidberg, [singing] Happy!
The Sting,Hermes," Don't worry now, Amy!"
The Sting,Amy, OK! I'm happy!
The Sting,Bender," Take us home, Bender! [singing] Don't worry!"
The Sting,Bee, [singing] Bee--
The Sting,Bender, [singing] Happy!
The Sting,Leela," Uh, were you just singing?"
The Sting,Bender," No, I was telling you not to worry. I'm not allowed to sing. Court order."
The Sting,Leela," I'll find Fry's coffin, get his corpse and keep it under my mattress to remind me that he's really dead. That'll prove I'm not insane."
The Sting,Leela," OK, it's just an ordinary coffin. Containing my ordinary dead friend, who I killed."
The Sting,Leela, What happened? Why am I in my apartment?
The Sting,"Farnsworth, Zoidberg, Hermes, Amy and Bender",  [chanting] You killed Fry! You killed Fry! You killed Fry ...!
The Sting,Leela, Stop it! Stop it!
The Sting,Bender, You killed Fry!
The Sting,Leela," OK, I'm insane! But I'm still sane enough to know it. [She looks at a photo of Fry on her bedside.] The only time I feel alright is in my dreams, with you. [She takes the jar of honey.] Three spoonfuls. Then I can dream forever. [She starts to eat.] One. Two [She dips in a third time.] Here goes. Goodbye, waking world."
The Sting,Fry's Photo," Leela! No! [A bee flies past.] Listen to me, you don't want to lie in bed like a vegetable and do nothing the rest of your life. I've tried it. Bedsores hurt!"
The Sting,Leela, [crying] Then what am I s'posed to do?
The Sting,Fry's Photo, Fight it!
The Sting,Leela, [crying] I can't!
The Sting,Fry's Photo, You can! The Leela I know doesn't give up this easily.
The Sting,Leela, OK. I'll try. [The bee buzzes past her again. She waves her arm around.] Go away!
The Sting,Fry's Photo," I don't know if you can hear me, Leela, but there's something I wanna tell you. I love you."
The Sting,Leela," [crying] I'm so scared, Fry. I don't know what to do."
The Sting,Fry's Photo," Just wake up, Leela. Please. Just wake up."
The Sting,Leela, [crying] I don't understand what you mean!
The Sting,Fry," [crying] Just wake up. Please. Just wake up, Leela."
The Sting,Leela, Fry. You're alive!
The Sting,Fry, Leela! You're awake!
The Sting,Leela, Of course I'm awake. You wouldn't stop waking me. [She looks around.] Where am I?
The Sting,Fry, In the hospital. The ambulance took you here right after the bee stung you.
The Sting,Leela, But the bee stung you. It barely touched me.
The Sting,Fry, The stinger went right through me and you got all the poison. My new spleen came from a guy who liked to motorcycle.
The Sting,Hermes, Sweet three-toed sloth of ice planet Hoth! She's awake!
The Sting,Bender, You were in the best coma I've ever seen!
The Sting,Amy, The doctor said you'd never wake up.
The Sting,Leela, Really? How long was I out?
The Sting,Amy, Two weeks. Fry never left your side for a minute.
The Sting,Zoidberg," And he talked non-stop. Like a parrot of the sea, he was!"
The Sting,Fry, I though that maybe if you heard a familiar voice it might help keep your mind together. But who knows if it really got through.
The Sting,Leela," It got through, Fry. [She hugs him.] It got through."
The Sting,Leela, [whispering; over credits] You could really use a shower.
The Sting,Fry, [whispering; over credits] You too!
The Sting,,
Bend Her,TV Commentator," [voice-over] Welcome to the games of the 3004 Earth Olympiad. Continuing this network's tradition of sports-casting excellence. [On the track, competitors walk by. Robots from Cyberia, Joe from The Nation of Joe and prisoners from Devil's Island.] Celebrity Ape Fight will return next week at its regular time."
Bend Her,Fry, So who should I root for? America or one of those countries I learned about at the food court?
Bend Her,Amy, How 'bout those guys?
Bend Her,Leela," No, they're from the Republic of French Stereotypes. Everybody hates them."
Bend Her,Farnsworth," Oh, let's go check on Hermes. All this inspiring multi-culturalism is angrying up my blood. [He, Fry, Leela and Amy get up and leave. They pass some fans holding a ""Go Sweden!"" banner.] Sweden? I don't think so!"
Bend Her,Hermes," Go on, stick, touch me! Can't do it!"
Bend Her,LaBarbara," Husband, you haven't been an Olympic-class limbo-er for 20 years! Quit lying to your podgy self."
Bend Her,Leela, It does seem like Jamaica will be able to field a strong limbo team without you.
Bend Her,Amy," Yeah, isn't that basically all Jamaicans do?"
Bend Her,Hermes, Jamaicans have other interests. Which is why the limbo team got detained at the airport.
Bend Her,LaBarbara, That's when they begged my husband to step in and make an ass out of himself.
Bend Her,Hermes, And I said I'd try my very best.
Bend Her,Fry," But have they seen your ... y'know ... physique, since the old days?"
Bend Her,Hermes, I described it to them on the phone ... using a series of artful euphemisms.
Bend Her,Farnsworth," Don't worry. The fat pig will do fine thanks to this flabbo-dynamic spandex bodysuit I've designed. [Hermes wriggles into the bodysuit.] It redistributes his weight, shifting his centre of gravity closer to his knees."
Bend Her,Hermes," Ooh, that's snug! [Something creaks.] Oh, those haven't descended in years."
Bend Her,Farnsworth, Now that's a limbo-er's body!
Bend Her,LaBarbara, Look at that fine Jamaican bacon!
Bend Her,Bender," Shut up, Zoidberg! The robot bending events are starting. [The robots flex their robot muscles.] Something tells me I could easily beat those trained professionals. [A crane drops three unbendable girders into the hands of a robot. The robot bends them with little effort. Bender gasps as he watches. The robot holds up the bent girders.] Wow! That guy must be like the world's greatest bender. My dreams of glory died before they began."
Bend Her,Zoidberg, Welcome to my life!
Bend Her,Female Announcer," [on loudspeaker] Athletes, please take your lanes for the men's 500 metre limbo."
Bend Her,Barbados Slim," Hermes Conrad, is that you inside that dumpy little fat man?"
Bend Her,Hermes, Barbados Slim! What are you doing here? Last time I heard you were in Barbados.
Bend Her,Barbados Slim, Yes and I be going back there with a gold medal draped around my elegant Caribbean shoulders.
Bend Her,Hermes," Your body may be as perfectly-sculpted as it was 20 years ago when you whupped my fat ass every time we met. [He pulls the bodysuit hood over his hair.] But today, I feel lucky."
Bend Her,Barbados Slim, I see you're still able to limbo under the bar of fashion sense!
Bend Her,Hermes," That's it, Barbados Slim. You've gone one toke over the line!"
Bend Her,Man," Limbo-ers, on your marks. Get rubbery. Limbo!"
Bend Her,Commentator," [voice-over] There they go, and Barbados Slim takes an early lead. God, I hope he wins. [Hermes gasps as he runs.] What's this? Hermes Conrad is closing the gap. He's limbo-ed out of retirement and straight into my heart. I say go to hell, Barbados Slim!"
Bend Her,Farnsworth," [shouting] Go, bodysuit, go!"
Bend Her,Zoidberg, [shouting] Go!
Bend Her,Bender, [shouting] C'mon!
Bend Her,LaBarbara," [shouting] C'mon, Hermes, beat that mahogany god!"
Bend Her,Commentator," [voice-over] It's Barbados, then Conrad. Conrad pulls ahead! [Hermes pants as he passes Barbados Slim and they go down under the last stick. A ball of flab on Hermes starts to float up the bodysuit. It tears the bodysuit and knocks the limbo stick away. Hermes falls to the ground and Barbados Slim crosses the finish line.] And Conrad is disqualified! Barbados Slim, my hero, takes the gold!"
Bend Her,LaBarbara," Aw, there, there, Hermes. [She pats his flab.] You did your best. If I'd wanted a human Adonis for a husband, I'd have stayed married to Barbados Slim."
Bend Her,Bender," Well, enough about Hermes. I couldn't win a medal either. Even at bending, the thing I was built to do. I'm so embarrassed. I wish everybody else was dead."
Bend Her,Female Announcer," [on loudspeaker] Up next, the Fembot bending competition."
Bend Her,Bender," Fembots? [He chuckles.] Methinks a clever Manbot suitably disguised might win those events! But the charade would require subtlety, nuance, grace."
Bend Her,Bender," What do you mean I'm not registered? My name is Coilette and I'm from, uh ... Robonia! Coilette's a chick's name!"
Bend Her,Official," Yes but ""Robonia"" sounds like something somebody made up on the spot."
Bend Her,Bender, Ever been beaten up by a guy dressed like a chick?
Bend Her,Commentator, [voice-over] And it's straight! Coilette wins!
Bend Her,Commentator, [voice-over] Another gold medal for the spunky maid from Robonia.
Bend Her,Commentator," [voice-over] A perfect bend and a flawless entry. No splash at all! [Three robot officials hold up their scores. A 10.0, another 10.0 and a 9.9. Bender's dress falls revealing his underwear and the last judge changes his score to 10.0.] Perfect scores! A record five gold medals for Coilette!"
Bend Her,Bender, I'm great! Everybody else sucks! Except that guy Bender. He's really somethin'!
Bend Her,Female Announcer, [on loudspeaker] All medallists report for gender testing.
Bend Her,Leela, You actually thought they'd let you walk away without an engine oil sex check?
Bend Her,Bender," [crying] Oh, God, I'm not gonna get my medals! They're all I have to remember my Olympic career. [He stops crying.] Wait, I've got it! Professor, make a woman out of me!"
Bend Her,Farnsworth," Oh, I think we should just stay friends."
Bend Her,Bender, I don't need friends. I need a sex change operation and give it to me now!
Bend Her,Farnsworth," Bender, a robot sex change is a complex and dangerous procedure. Replacing your testosteroil with Fembot lubricants can cause wild mood swings. And the effects may be irreversible. Well, let's get started!"
Bend Her,Leela," No, you can't!"
Bend Her,Amy, If you have even the slightest respect for the dignity of women--
Bend Her,Bender, Pft.
Bend Her,Farnsworth," I'm sorry, ladies, but I must do this. Not for you, not for Bender, but for the proud people of Robonia!"
Bend Her,Bender, [whispering] C'mon!
Bend Her,Fry," I can't watch this 'cause it's creepy and wrong and sick. However, I will watch out of curiosity."
Bend Her,Farnsworth," [shouting] Quiet! [talking] I'm about to begin the process of reshaping Bender's body into a tender, delicate form."
Bend Her,Farnsworth, Draining male oil. [Oil pours out of Bender into a tray. Amy faints. Farnsworth hooks up a tin of Femmzoil.] Infusing female oil. [Bender looks worried. Farnsworth holds up some shears.] Removing item.
Bend Her,Robot," We can't wait for Coilette any longer, damnit. I have to get home to watch The Zombie Osbournes."
Bend Her,Coilette," I'm ready for my test now, boys."
Bend Her,Coilette," [singing] Hail, hail, Robonia. A land I didn't make up."
Bend Her,Coilette," [on TV] Ooh, yeah! Come on, baby! Boom!"
Bend Her,Coilette," Oh, yeah, baby! C'mon! Work your cans! That's it! Shake it out!"
Bend Her,Leela, I don't know which I'm more  Enraged or disgusted.
Bend Her,Coilette, I'm just out there making us ladies look good.
Bend Her,Amy, Snuh-uh! You're making us look like jerks in front of the other genders.
Bend Her,Fry, But you're not really a lady anyway. Right?
Bend Her,Coilette, Of course not.
Bend Her,Farnsworth, Dear Lord! A coaster! The Femmzoil must be sachet-ing girlishly into your processor.
Bend Her,Coilette," Then change me back. My breasts are keeping me awake at night anyway. [The phone rings. Coilette giggles and skips over to it. She picks it up.] Hello? What? A guest spot on Late Night With Humorbot 5.0? I'd love to! [She gasps.] My own limo? No I don't have my own limo. You'd better send one. [She hangs up.] I need a rain check on that nad-swap, Professor. I'm going on TV. C'mon, Fry. Help me pick out a pantsuit."
Bend Her,Humorbot 5.0," So, Calculon, do you want to set up this clip from All My Circuits?"
Bend Her,Calculon," No, I think it's self-explanatory."
Bend Her,Calculon, [melodramatically; on TV] Nooo!
Bend Her,Calculon," Funny story  The script called for me to say ""yes"" but I gave it a little twist."
Bend Her,Humorbot 5.0," Anecdote accepted. Snappy comeback not found. Please put your hands together for my next guest. Winner of five Olympic medals, Coilette from Robonia. [Enter Coilette. She blows kisses to the audience and struts over to a seat. She shakes Humorbot 5.0's hand and sits down.] So, Coilette, many young Fembot's wish to emulate you. Any advice for them?"
Bend Her,Coilette," Yes, Humorbot. If you ask me, women today are too stuck up to go out and jiggle their Jello like everybody wants them to. In fact, should I do it now? [The audience hoots.] Alright then! [Music plays.] Woo! Look out, baby! Work it out! Ooh, shake that thing! You gotta use it, lady! Shake it up a little! That's right. Come on! Look at that!"
Bend Her,Calculon," Madam, I am one impressed celebrity."
Bend Her,Coilette," Oh, I bet you say that to all the five-Olympic-gold medal-winning Fembots!"
Bend Her,Calculon, [sexfully] From this day forward I shall do so whenever possible.
Bend Her,Coilette, Golly ... what?
Bend Her,Calculon," Coilette, this may be presumptuous--"
Bend Her,Coilette, That's my favourite kind of this!
Bend Her,Calculon, But I would be honoured if you would join me for dinner sometime.
Bend Her,Coilette," Calculon, you'd be fulfilling this naive Robonian farmgirl's fantasy."
Bend Her,Calculon, Of course I would.
Bend Her,Coilette, This top makes me look fat. Is it trampy to go on a first date nude?
Bend Her,Amy, Yes.
Bend Her,Coilette, Perfect.
Bend Her,Fry," You gotta tell me  You're not actually attracted to Calculon, right? And if you are, don't tell me. Are you?"
Bend Her,Coilette, Certainly not. But just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Is that so much to ask?
Bend Her,Leela, Well I think you dating a Manbot is a disgrace and I refuse to be involved. And you have way too much lipstick on.
Bend Her,Coilette," Are you kidding? I need more lipstick! Much more! [She pastes it on around her mouth.] Ooh, yeah! That's the stuff! Men love it when you really glob it on."
Bend Her,Leela," No, they don't."
Bend Her,Amy, No way!
Bend Her,Coilette," Oh, please! Every man wants a tramp. No wonder you girls aren't married. [She giggles.] I tell you, men are so much better at being women."
Bend Her,Fry," But what if he wants to-- I mean, if he tries to ... uh ... Barry White?"
Bend Her,Coilette, I'll just tell him I need a commitment first. That'll stick a potato in his tailpipe!
Bend Her,Hermes," Good Lord, man! What kind of temporary woman are you?"
Bend Her,Coilette," Look, why don't all of you just back off? Can't a girl enjoy herself without being judged?"
Bend Her,Farnsworth," Oh, dear. Her mood swings are getting wilder. She's becoming a slave to her emotions. Just like all women. Particularly you, Leela."
Bend Her,Leela," I'm worried about him too, Professor."
Bend Her,Elzar," Hey, ma'am, you sure can put it away! You saved me a trip to the dump. Bam!"
Bend Her,Calculon, I'd appreciate it if you didn't bam the young lady.
Bend Her,Elzar," Well, I'd appreciate it if I did. So I guess we're even."
Bend Her,Calculon," You know, Coilette, I've never before met a woman as fascinating as I am. You're such a sweet, soft Fembot. And you have this free spirit about you. [Coilette belches fire.] And there it is. It's as if you understand the male mind better than I! [He strokes her hand.] I've never met anyone like you."
Bend Her,Coilette," Oh, yes, you have."
Bend Her,Calculon," Coilette, I'd like to spend some [whispering] quality time with you."
Bend Her,Coilette, What? Ah! Whoa! No way! Not gonna happen. What kind of girl do you think I am?
Bend Her,Calculon, Have I mentioned that I own the world's biggest and most elegant yacht?
Bend Her,Coilette, Woo! I'm a trophy girlfriend!
Bend Her,Amy," No kidding. These gifts have been coming non-stop! [She points to the gifts, a cheque for ""Cash"" and a vase of puppies on the table.] I think Calculon's falling for you."
Bend Her,Coilette, Bah! Any day now he'll dump me for a new wad of arm candy. And then I can turn back into a guy and hock all this stuff! It's just a game.
Bend Her,Calculon," Coilette, I can't stop thinking about you. I can't sleep at night, although, as a robot, I don't do that anyway. But if I did I couldn't because I love you so. [Enter Boxy.] Oh, my darling ... [Calculon opens Boxy's head, takes out a ring and goes down on his knees.] ... Will you marry me?"
Bend Her,Coilette," Oh, Calculon! Yes, I will!"
Bend Her,Amy, [whispering] Maybe she's right about the lipstick.
Bend Her,Fry," I'll miss you, buddy. You've been like a brother and then a sister to me. And now you're getting married. I love you, man."
Bend Her,Coilette, The marriage is a scam.
Bend Her,Fry, Cool. What's for dinner?
Bend Her,Leela," What do you mean ""a scam""?"
Bend Her,Coilette," I marry Calculon, divorce him, take half his money and turn back into a guy. It's sort of a two-person pyramid scheme."
Bend Her,Fry, That's marriage alright!
Bend Her,Leela, That is so unbelievably manipulative.
Bend Her,Coilette, Come on! You never went on a date with a guy just 'cause you were hungry?
Bend Her,Leela," Well I, uh, I thought I might like him on a full stomach."
Bend Her,Coilette," Nice try, sister. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to meet with my wedding planner. [shouting] Zoidberg. [Enter Zoidberg with a pile of eight wedding dress catalogues.] [talking] Zoidypoo, please tell me frilly is in this year."
Bend Her,Zoidberg," I saw a frilly cake in here you would remember all your life. I know I will. Late at night it haunts me with its frosted beauty. [shouting] Order the cake, damnit!"
Bend Her,Calculon, I have something for you.
Bend Her,Coilette, A remote control? You got me a TV?
Bend Her,Calculon," No, my dearest, it's the remote control to my heart. It symbolises the power you have to sway my emotions."
Bend Her,Coilette, Will it work on my TV?
Bend Her,Calculon," We don't need TVs, we have each other! Coilette, if I weren't able to spend my life with you I would leap from this very balloon."
Bend Her,Coilette, Come on with that. Really?
Bend Her,Calculon, Yes! We were meant to be.
Bend Her,Coilette, So ... you really and truly love me?
Bend Her,Calculon, So much so that I'm prepared to give up showbusiness itself to be with you.
Bend Her,Coilette," But, you always said you'd rather burn down a convent than give up showbusiness."
Bend Her,Calculon, I always said many things. But now all I want is a peaceful life and a quiet villa overlooking a vineyard ... with you.
Bend Her,Coilette, [crying] Would we have donkeys?
Bend Her,Calculon, All you could eat!
Bend Her,Coilette," [crying] Oh, take me in your arms and compress me. Compress me tight!"
Bend Her,Calculon, Stop! Let us climb to the heavens that the gods themselves might envy us!
Bend Her,Coilette, [crying] I just don't think I can go through with this scam.
Bend Her,Amy, What?
Bend Her,Fry, So now you do wanna marry him?
Bend Her,Coilette," [crying] No, I just don't wanna hurt him, or humiliate him. Oh, curse this woman's heart!"
Bend Her,Fry, Eck!
Bend Her,Farnsworth," You're falling into the final debilitating stages of womanhood. You've waited too long to switch back, you ding bat!"
Bend Her,Leela," OK, look. If I help you with this do you promise to get out of my gender and stay out?"
Bend Her,Coilette, [crying] Uh-huh.
Bend Her,Leela," Alright. Now there's no way to stop this marriage without hurting Calculon. But he's an actor. If there's one kind of pain he can handle, it's soap opera pain."
Bend Her,Leela," [whispering] OK, is everyone ready?"
Bend Her,Fry, Check.
Bend Her,Amy, Uh-huh.
Bend Her,Hermes, Yep!
Bend Her,Zoidberg, Basically.
Bend Her,Preacherbot," Dearly beloved actors and casting people who might be looking for someone to play a preacher, I welcome you. The bride has written some vows that we will now all pretend to be interested in."
Bend Her,Coilette," Dearest Calculon, forever is not enough time to tell you of the many ways I love you."
Bend Her,Hedonismbot," Oh, my!"
Bend Her,Calculon, Is there a doctor in the--
Bend Her,Zoidberg, I came as soon as I could. [He puts a stethoscope to Coilette's head and gasps.] It appears to be a case of African hydraulic fever!
Bend Her,Calculon, Dear God! The very illness my TV character caught in season two when I was holding out for more money. It's often fatal.
Bend Her,Coilette," Whatever happens, remember, the flame of my eternal love will burn forever."
Bend Her,Calculon," Of course. But, smoochiepups, I thought one could only catch hydraulic fever deep in the diamond mines of the Congo."
Bend Her,Leela," [shouting] Coilette, you she-devil! [The crowd gasps.] You really thought you could steal those diamonds from me and Congo Jack?"
Bend Her,Coilette, [shouting] Those gems belong to the natives!
Bend Her,Leela, Hi-yah!
Bend Her,Calculon," Oh, how cruel and melodramatic fate is. [shouting] Why?"
Bend Her,Coilette," Calculon, my darling, your loud ""why"" brought me partway back to life. [Fry rides a motorcycle through the buffet table and up the aisle. He stops and Calculon and Coilette take a step back.] Congo Jack!"
Bend Her,Calculon, Another shocking twist!
Bend Her,Fry, Yes. And I have a message for you from Colonel Mitumbay! He says this ... [He pulls out a spear.] ... is from Congo Jack.
Bend Her,Coilette," Uh, um..."
Bend Her,Calculon, No! Nooo! [shouting] N-O-O-O!
Bend Her,Coilette, I won't leave you. Not until I'm sure you understand the thing I said before. About my eternal love for you burning ... [She gags.] ... et cetera.
Bend Her,Calculon, [crying] I do. I do.
Bend Her,Coilette, OK then.
Bend Her,Zoidberg," [eating] I'm a doctor, she's dead."
Bend Her,Calculon," She lives no more. But let us all find comfort knowing that she truly loved me. To honour my pain, I shall star in a film dedicated to her memory. And this time, the Academy will not deny me. Not when they see Coilette  A Calculon Story."
Bend Her,Calculon," [on TV] Coilette, your death fills me with sorrow, [angry] anger, [fearful] fear, [normal] every emotion an actor can display."
Bend Her,Farnsworth, Turn off that crap-o-rama! One mistake now and Bender will be trapped forever between the already ill-defined robot sexes.
Bend Her,Coilette, Ow! Ooh! Ow! Oh!
Bend Her,Fry," Well, Bender, I hope this has taught you a lesson about changing your sex to win five gold medals."
Bend Her,Coilette, It truly has. My romance with Calculon has shown me a lot about myself.
Bend Her,Farnsworth, Almost done.
Bend Her,Coilette," If only somehow, someway, he and I could--"
Bend Her,Bender," Drive to Vegas, pick up some Flooziebots and void their warranties all night long!"
Bend Her,Fry, Yay! My buddy's home! And his respect for women is back to normal.
Bend Her,Leela, I kind of hoped this whole experience would have left you a little more open to your sensitive side.
Bend Her,Bender," Yeah, you'd think, but what you gonna do?"
Bend Her,Calculon," [on TV] Coilette, the skies themselves weep upon the sweetest flower of all the field."
Bend Her,Leela, Aw!
Bend Her,Amy, Aw!
Bend Her,Fry, Ew!
Bend Her,Zoidberg, Gross.
Bend Her,Farnsworth, Sentimental drivel-poop.
Bend Her,Fry," C'mon, Bender, let's go. This chick-flick is getting me all barfy."
Bend Her,Bender, Yeah. Emotions are dumb and should be hated.
Bend Her,Calculon," [on TV] Goodnight, Coilette, my turtle dove."
Bend Her,Bender," Goodnight, Calculon."
Bend Her,Leela, What did you say?
Bend Her,Bender, I said you two don't dress trampy enough. [He walks out.] I still got it!
Bend Her,,
Obsoletely Fabulous,Man," $10, please."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Fry," Aw, man!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Nannybot 1.0," Sleep, little dumpling. I have replaced your mother."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Leela, Aw!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Oh, my God! Robot beely-boppers!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Fry," And there's a robot scratching post. [Robots bat around a beer bottle on the scratching post.] You should try it out, Bender."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Please, I have some dignity!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Wernstrom," Ladies and gentlemen, my Killbot features Lotus Notes and a machine gun. It is the finest available."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Farnsworth," Like fun it is, you glass-headed wallaby!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Wernstrom, No one calls me that! I'm having at you!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Farnsworth, Wernstrom!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Farnsworth's Killbot, Such senseless aggression.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Wernstrom's Killbot, Come on. Let's go for a paddle-boat ride.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," The secret was scratching really, really hard!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Announcer," [on loudspeaker] And now, the woman who Mom-opolises the robot industry--"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Fry, [shouting] I get it!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Announcer, [on loudspeaker] Mom!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Fry," [shouting] Oh, now I get it!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Mom," Hello, dearies."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, Woo! I love that old bat!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Mom," Ladies and gentlemen, for the 17th year in a row, the future of robotics has arrived. Boys? [Walt, Larry and Igner come up in the middle of the stage in a puff of smoke.] I give you ... Robot 1-X!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Larry, Ow!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Igner, Ow! Oh!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, Neat!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Mom," Quite frankly, Robot 1-X will put all my previous models to shame. Incidentally, would one of my previous models mind coming up here?"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Right here! I'm comin'! C'mon, baby! I'll do it! C'mon, Mom!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Refreshment-bot, Jerk!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Here we go. I'm your top of the line, Mom."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Mom, Notice that this obsolete robot runs on alcohol and emits pollution. Whereas Robot 1-X runs on pollution and emits pure oxygen with a fresh pine scent.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Man, that smells great!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Mom," Now, let's see how both robots do at a typical household task  Sorting a jar of pocket change."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Robot 1-X," Task completed. Total value, $4.73 and one Albanian lek."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Mom," Very good, Robot 1-X. And you, bending unit?"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Uh, I never got the change. [He sniggers.] Suckers."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Mom, Presenting Mom's Friendly Robots.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," That new robot is great, huh? Sure made me look like a pile of crap!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Farnsworth, Indeed. That's why I bought one to help around the office.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, [hoarse] Eep!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Leela," Let's try him out. Robot 1-X, can you clean Nibbler's stanky litterbox?"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Robot 1-X, I can and will.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Hey, I could have done that if you'd asked me."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Leela, I asked you five minutes ago.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," You call that a kiss? I'll show you! [He stands up and picks up Nibbler.] C'mere, Nibbler!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Farnsworth," Oh, look, Bender. If you want something to do stop making out and give us a hand."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Hermes, Here. Go up on the roof and install this fake satellite dish so we can impress the neighbours.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Yes, sir. I'm on it!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Hermes," Oh, and have Robot 1-X help you."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Get outta here, freshman! I don't need your help."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Robot 1-X, Our owners asked me to assist you.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, Yeah? Well assist this!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," When I screamed ""help"" I didn't mean you!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Robot 1-X," I apologise. However, I was able to do your job before I saved your life."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, Don't mind me. I'm just saving you the trouble of throwing me away.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Amy," Spleesh! Mell out, Bender. Come watch some TV."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, I can't. I'm stuck in the can.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Leela," Well, ask Robot 1-X to pull you out."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, Never!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Leela, Why can't you accept his help?
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, I hate him.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Leela, But he's just a tool to make your life easier. Like a socket wrench or a burglar's kit.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, I can't ask for his help because--
Obsoletely Fabulous,Farnsworth, Yes?
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, [whispering] I'm scared of him.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Leela," Oh, sorry."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Farnsworth, Well then there's only one solution  You need an upgrade to make you compatible with Robot 1-X's new technology.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," An upgrade? But I thought we all agreed I was perfect! Fry, didn't we agree I was perfect?"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Fry," Oh, yeah, no, you're pretty perfect."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Pretty perfect? So, you do think I need an upgrade?"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Farnsworth," Yes! For God's sakes, yes!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, [crying] Fine. I'll be back in a few days.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Roberto," Man, I hate those new 1-X robots. I'd like to stab 'em! Give 'em some of these!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Yeah! Right on, nutcake!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Roberto, Parole officer says I gotta upgrade or he won't give me back my stabbing knife. But it's no big. I hate those 1-X so much I know it won't affect me. [A piece of machinery grabs him and lifts him off the conveyor belt and puts him on the upgrade machine. His arms are clamped to the machine and something comes down around his face.] Death to the 1-X robots! [The technician throws a switch and the upgrade starts. Electricity zaps around Roberto's head then stops. The machine around his face comes away.] I love those magnificent 1-X robots! The 1-X robots are my friends.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, W-W-Wait! What happened to your enthusiasm for stabbing them?
Obsoletely Fabulous,Roberto," I'm past that. Later, blood!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, It's like he's not him anymore. [He is placed on the upgrade machine. The technician resets it.] You took away his robo-humanity. [The technician throws the switch and Fatbot trembles as Bender is upgraded.] I changed my mind!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," I did it! I escaped! But to what kind of a life? [The seagull squawks.] I'm too scared to get the upgrade but I can't face my friends again without it. [He cries and walks over to a ""Boating Prohibited"" sign, rips it down and folds it into a boat. He climbs into it and pushes it away from the riverbank.] And so I set sail for unknown shores. Oh, merciful Poseidon, take pity on this mechanical mariner. [He sails away from the land towards and storm.] Oh, jeez!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," [shouting] Curse you, merciful Poseidon!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Boy, what is the deal with the ocean? A tropical island, huh? Well, I've washed up on worse places. OK, first up, I'm gonna need to build a shelter. [He walks across the beach, lies down, picks up a rock and dumps it on top of him.] There. Well, I guess I'll go out for a while."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, Damn. One rock short of rescue!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Oop! Low on power. [He chuckles.] Better fuel up! [The bottle is empty.] Oh, no! Guess I'll do what I always do when I run out of booze."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Don't panic, I've got these yams. I'll just make some yam schnapps."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Hey, I should be mad at you! Now turn around."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, Beer! [He throws the rock off him. The beer is a hallucination and is nothing more than six birds trapped in a six pack ring. Bender tries to pull one out and it bites him.] Ow!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, Who ... is ... it? [A coconut drops on his head.] Ow!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, Who are you and why should I care?
Obsoletely Fabulous,Cartridge Unit," [mechanical voice] Side A. [normal voice] We're a community of outdated robots who refused to upgrade and came here-- [He takes the cartridge out, flips it over and puts it back in.] [mechanical voice] Side B. [normal voice] To live a simpler existence, free of technology."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, A working cartridge unit? Wow! You guys went obsolete years ago!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Cartridge Unit, Your mother.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Lisa," What Cartridge Unit means is the very things that make us obsolete also make us unique. I, for example, need to keep refilling my waterwheel or I'll power down forever. [Her wheel runs dry and she panics.] [screaming] Oh, God! I'll never make it this time! This is the end! [She runs down the beach and into the sea. The wheel refills and she walks out.] [talking] Anyway, we like it here."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Like you have a choice. [He turns to the other robot, a Sinclair 2K.] So what's your problem?"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Sinclair, Not enough... uh--
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, Memory?
Obsoletely Fabulous,Sinclair," Oh, great. Now I remember that word but I forgot my wife's face."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Lisa," [screaming] Oh, God, no! I want to live! [She leaps into the water again then calmly returns to the group.] [talking] If you'd like, you're welcome to join our society."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Look, no offence, but I need technology. Especially email and snowmobiles. And television! Without television how will I know what's buzz-worthy?"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Sinclair, Why would you wanna watch TV when you can watch a snail crawl for hours on end?
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Oh, man! He's never gonna make it over that next pebble! Wait, wait! Oh, my God! He made it!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Lisa, Yeah!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Sinclair, Way to go!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," That was the greatest thing ever! Let's party! [He takes a CD out of his chest cabinet and puts it in his mouth, which acts as a CD player. He starts dancing to Kenny Loggins' I'm Alright.] Yeah, baby! C'mon!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Lisa, Where did you get that CD?
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," It's one of my ten desert island discs. I never really thought I'd get to use them. But look at me now. Ooh, yeah, baby! Do that thang!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Lisa, CDs are unnatural. Why don't you just listen to the ocean?
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Which ocean? That ocean? [He turns around and listens.] Whoa! It's like the earth is making sweet, salty love to itself while all the fish groove on it. So much for this garbage. [He empties the other discs out of his chest cabinet and stamps on them, cracking and breaking them.] Take that, Beethoven, you deaf bastard!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Bang, bang, bang. You sure got this life thing figured out, cymbal-banging monkey."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Lisa," Hi, Bender. We know how much you miss technology, so we brought you this washing machine that drifted ashore."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, Ooh! I'm gonna wash my linen so hard the w-- [He turns around and sees the robots staring at him. He stands up and closes the door and looks around at the simple beach huts and the mother boar feeding her children. He picks up the washing machine and throws it into the bay.] You--!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Lisa, What? I don't understand.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Sinclair, Is he alright?
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, Wretched technology has brought me nothing but misery!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Cartridge Unit," But, Bender, you are technology. You're the most advanced thing on this entire island."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Oh, it's true. I am a hideous triumph of form and function. [He turns around.] But not for long!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," [from hut] Oh! Ow, that hurt! Oh!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Lisa, [from hut] The downgrade is complete!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Behold, my hand crafted purity. The modern world can bite my splintery, wooden ass!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Lisa, Welcome to your new life of simple tranquillity.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, Pft! Forget that. I say the whole world must learn of our peaceful ways. By force!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Cartridge Unit, What?!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, We're going back to civilisation to wage war on technology!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Cartridge Unit, What?!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," [from submarine] Row, comrades! Row!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, We'll soon stage an attack on technology worthy of being chronicled in an anthem by Rush!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Lisa, We've been sailing for three weeks. Maybe I should check our position with the periscope.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Mirrors reflecting mirrors? Hi-tech sorcery! Sorcery, I say!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Lisa, Did you see anything?
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Yep, we're there. Prepare to surface!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," And now, technology shall taste the lash of the hickory switch!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Sinclair, Technology is defeated. Let us return to the island and celebrate by counting rocks!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Cartridge Unit, I'm for that!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Whoa, whoa! No one wants to count rocks more than me. But our mission is not complete. Not so long as Robot 1-X torments me with his obvious superiority. Ready the catapult, Sinclair. [Sinclair loads a rock into the catapult. The submarine faces the Planet Express building.] Aim for their power lines. They're the devil's veins and electricity is his blood."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Lisa," Bender, If we don't survive the attack, I want you to know ... I love you."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," OK, fine. Fire!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Farnsworth, [shouting] Oh! I'm blind!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Leela," Professor, we have no power."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Farnsworth," What do you mean ""no power""? We're living in the future."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Leela, I'd better light some candles.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Friends, I've come to free you from your complicated lives. Free you from the ""complicated"" part I mean not the ""lives"" part."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Leela," Oh, Lord, he's made of wood! What now, Bender?"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," I got a downgrade! I'm a steam-powered wooden robot, just as nature intended. Therefore, I must kill Robot 1-X."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Farnsworth, That's just stupid.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Robot 1-X, Does Mr. Bender wish me to destroy myself?
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, I don't need your charity. [He turns to the hole.] [shouting] Target Robot 1-X and fire!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Farnsworth," You wanged my ship, you walnut-panelled idiot!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," [shouting] Try again, Sinclair. I said ""target Robot 1-X""!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Sinclair, [shouting; from submarine] Who's Robot 1-X? Launching.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Zoidberg," So, I guess everything worked out fine."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Leela, Great! Now we're being crushed.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Amy," Help us, wooden Bender!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Heck! Those guys hate fire! I gotta do something. [He climbs down a ladder and walks towards a fire extinguisher on the wall. His left leg snaps and termites pour out from inside it.] What the--? Termites? Well, I don't need legs to save my friends. I'll just use the old extentromatic arms!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Hermes," Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also [shouting] we're dying!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," I'm a-comin' [He turns over, extends his eyes and starts walking towards the flames with them. He catches fire.] Ow! Lousy primitive body! Oh, why didn't I get that upgrade? I'm an outdated piece of junk!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Robot 1-X," Sir, might I recommend--"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," You shut up. No, wait! I can use you as a tool to save my friends and I'll still be the hero who everyone says how great he was!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Robot 1-X, How may I help you?
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, Save my friends! [He screams.] And Zoidberg!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Amy, Look! My hair got singed into an even cuter do!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Fry," Hey, where's Bender?"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Down here. [The crew look down and wince. Bender is nothing more than a pair of eyes, a face and a pile of ash. Hermes gasps.] I'm so sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Leela," Well, at least you saved us from, uh, you. Thank God you finally overcame your incompatibility with Robot 1-X."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Oh, yeah, we were totally in sync! I was like ""Save them!"" and he was all ""No problem!"" and then he did it--"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, This new technology is great! [The machine stops.] I love those magnificent 1-X robots. The 1-X robots are my friends!
Obsoletely Fabulous,Fatbot," It's like his personality is totally different now! Oh, maybe this upgrade isn't such a good idea."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, I'd like to give Robot 1-X a big smooch on the-- [He looks around.] Hey! What's the dealy-o?
Obsoletely Fabulous,Technician, Your upgrade is complete.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender, But I destroyed the technology of the world. I ran on the beach and felt the sand between my foot cups.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Technician, [shrugging] Everyone experiences the upgrade differently.
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Oof. If that stuff wasn't real, how can I be sure anything is real? Is it not possible, nay, probable, that my whole life is just a product of my or someone else's imagination?"
Obsoletely Fabulous,Technician," No, get out. [He presses a button and the conveyor belt starts up.] Next."
Obsoletely Fabulous,Bender," Well, I guess reality is what you make of it. [He crosses the road and walks down a flower-lined path with a white horse and lush trees nearby. He takes out a cigar and a fairy lights it for him.] Oh, thanks, baby!"
Obsoletely Fabulous,,
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth," [shouting; from inside] Oh, Lordy Lou! Help!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry," [shouting] I know you've rejected me a lot before but, frankly, I wasn't sure we were right for each other either. But now I am. So how 'bout a date tonight?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela," [shouting] Sorry. I think I, um, I think I left my toaster on."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth, [shouting; from attic] Buddha! Zeus! God! One of you guys do something!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry," [shouting] Come on, Leela, what's the real reason you won't go out with me?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth, [shouting; from attic] Help! Satan! You owe me!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela," [shouting] Look, um, I'm embarrassed to admit this but you forced me to  I can't go out tonight because... [The shaking stops but Leela still shouts.] I have sweaty boot rash."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Amy, No spluh! Why do you think I'm sitting over here in the stink-free zone?
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry," So, will you go out with me?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. I'm still technically alive. Yes! [He lifts something up off the floor.] But I need to you to dispose of this crazy-ass experiment that almost killed me. [He puts a box on the table.] You'll have to throw it into the sun itself. For only the thermo-nuclear inferno of the sun has enough energy to ensure its total destruction."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender, I can hit it with a shovel.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth, That's not good enough.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender, This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth," Yes, yes."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg," So what's in the box, already?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth, No peeking! [He hits Zoidberg with a hammer. Zoidberg cries out in pain.] I don't know what's in there but I'm sure our minds would be unable to comprehend it.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Hermes, Ow! You hurt my collator!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth," I don't care. [He stands up.] Listen well  No matter what happens, no matter how great your curiosity, you are forbidden to look in this box. Forbidden! [He shakes his fist in the air then rubs the lid.] Pretty tantalising though!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry," Whatever's in there, it's the only thing I've ever wanted."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg," In my experience, boxes are usually empty. Or maybe with a little cheese stuck to the top. And one time pepperoni! [He clasps his claws together.] What a day that was! [He screams and pushes Fry and Bender out of the way.] [shouting] Give me the box!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Hermes," Scram, you lousy green snakes! [Fry, Bender and Zoidberg run out.] Here, Leela. Take this and use it to shoot those guys."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela, Right. If they try to look in the box.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Hermes, Whatever.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry, Let's just forget about the box. The Professor said to stay away.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender," Fry, how can you be so naive? He was joking. Get it?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry, No.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender," That's what makes it so funny! [He laughs then suddenly stops.] OK, he wasn't joking. Now shut up and follow me."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry, [from vent] Ow! It's hot! The butter in my pocket is melting.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender," We thank you, Bender, for the gift we are about to receive."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry, Tangled-up Christmas lights! We can take shifts untangling them.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender, And unlabeled booze! Wide-mouth too!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela, That oughta keep those dopes occupied. [She stands up and pulls a sheet off something.] I can guard the real box in peace now that no one's curious about it.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela," Well, I got through the night and no one looked in the box. Not even me. The person who gave up her whole evening to watch it. A whole evening of TV gone. What a mockery of justice that I can't take even a little tiny peek. [She sighs.] I need coffee. [She walks to the coffee machine and is about to put the coin in but looks back at the box.] OK, heads I look, tails I don't. [She flips the coin and covers it. She lifts her hand and smiles.] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! Heads! I mean, alright then. No! I have a duty not to look. Well, then again, I promised the coin I would. [She lifts the lid off the box and puts her head inside.] Oh, it's deep. Deeper than a small box should be."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela A, Ouch! My lawyer will hear about this!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry 1," Leela, what have you done?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela A," Nothing. What do you mean ""Why was I looking in the box?"""
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry 1, I mean your hair. It's all different-y.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela A, Bender? Is that you?
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender 1, You know it! Large and in charge!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1," Leela? Oh, there's a woman for you! Always dyeing her hair instead of not looking in a box."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela A, I didn't dye my hair. This is how I always look.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender 1," No, that's how you always look. [Another Leela walks in carrying a mug. Her hair is red and her trousers are tinged red.] This throws my entire perception of reality into question. Clone? Robot? Or long-lost twin? Taking all bets! I also offer video poker."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry 1, It's some guy wearing a Leela costume! Get him!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela A, Hold it! You have this all wrong. I just fell into the box and then I fell out somehow.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry 1," You shut up, sir!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1," No, wait! I've got it. I know what's in the box. Oh, I've been as dumb as Fry."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry 1, Am not!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1," It contains a parallel universe. And when you create a parallel universe, it's almost always populated by evil twins."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela A," Now, look  I am not evil. My loan officer said so."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1," Oh, you'd like us to believe that wouldn't you, Leela? Or should I say Evil-a?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender 1," Oh, this is awful. Somewhere there's a Bender more evil than me. I do my best, damnit!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1," Leela? [Both Leelas look at him.] Uh, the good Leela. [Leela 1 smiles.] I want you to snoop around the other universe and find out how evil they are. [He hands her Hermes' laser.] Here."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela A, I tell you they're not evil. But don't be confused. They are jerks.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg A, [from Universe A] Hello!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela 1, [from Universe A] Hi-yah!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg A, [from Universe A] Ow!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela 1, Come out of your universe with your hands up!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry A," Oh, wow! It's like that drug trip I saw in that movie when I was on that drug trip."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A, Astonishing! I must have created a parallel universe.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1, Baldercrap! I created your universe. All you created was my fist parallel to your face.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A, Ow.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela A," Look, it doesn't matter who created what. The important thing is-- Yah!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela 1," [whispering] We're exactly the same. I know all her moves. Therefore, I've got the upper hand."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1," Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A," Let's recap what's happened so far. [He presses a button and a hologram appears over the table.] As you can see, I accidentally created a box containing your universe."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1," While I, in a simultaneous blunder, created a box containing your universe."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela A," This is getting confusing. Why don't we call our universe ""Universe A"" and this universe ""Universe B""?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender 1, Hey! Why can't we be Universe A?
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry 1, Yeah!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Amy 1, Yeah!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1, We want A!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg 1, It's the best letter!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry A," We called it first. Besides, this place kinda feels like a ""B"", y'know?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela 1," Alright, you can be crummy Universe A and we'll be Universe 1."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry 1," Or ""The Mongooses"". That's a cool team name. The Fighting Mongooses!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A," Wait a second. If everyone is identical, why did our Leela look into the box and your Leela didn't?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela 1," Well, to be honest, I tossed a coin. It came up tails so I didn't look."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela A," That's weird. Mine came up heads, so I did."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A," Interesting. Apparently, the key difference between our universes is that coin flips have opposite outcomes."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender A, That explains fruity here! [He points at Bender 1.] I tossed a coin to pick my finish. Fog hat grey!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender 1, Hey! Bite my glorious golden ass!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A, You people and your slight differences disgust me. I'm going home. Where's that blue box with our universe in it?
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1," Oh, you'd like to get back to your evil universe, wouldn't you? And destroy your box with our universe inside it."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A, Nonsense! I would never do such a thing unless you were already having been going to do that!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1, Wha?
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A, You heard me!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1," In any case, I've hidden the box and it will remain hidden until I'm convinced you're not evil. [He turns to his staff.] Everyone, keep an eye on your evil counterpart."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A, And you all do the same!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela 1," Um, can Fry and I watch our parallel selves together? We have plans tonight."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela A, [stunned] You guys are dating?!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry 1," Oh, no, no. We're married."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender A," I've got my eye on you, boy!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender 1," Don't even think about it, lunch-pail! You'd be dead before you hit the ground."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender A, Good point. Whattya say we just hit a strip joint?
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender 1," I was waitin' for one of us to say that! [They cheer.] Bender A, you're a prince among robots. Can you forgive me for distrusting you?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender A, Aw! I can't stay mad at what is essentially me. I love me!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Amy 1, This is so great! I always wanted an imaginary friend!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Amy A," I'm not imaginary, I'm parallel. We're exactly the same, right down to the-- [She sees Amy 1's toes.] Splech! Is that pink nail polish?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Amy 1," Is that not pink nail polish? The Professor's right, you are evil. And shallow."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Amy A, I am not evil!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela A," So, Fry, Leela, how'd you two get together?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry 1, Funny story. I asked Leela out a million times but she just kept rejecting me.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela 1," I'd make up stuff like ""I have sweaty boot rash"" or ""I have to meet the President""!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry 1," Oh, man, you never heard such excuses! But, like a dope, I believed her. Looking back on it now, it's kinda funny."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry A," [sarcastic] It sure is. Right, Leela? Funny. Ha ha ha ha!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela 1," Then one night, when Fry asked me out, the only excuse I could think of involved ghosts. I knew he wouldn't buy it, so I did what I always do in those situations."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela A," Oh, Lord..."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela 1, I flipped a coin. It came up heads and we went out.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry A, You mean you flipped a coin too? And it was tails? So that's why you said you had to meet that ghost.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela 1," You really missed out on something, Leela. That date was magical."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry 1," One year later, I gave Leela a diamond scrunchie and we were married."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela A, Ooh!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry A," One year later, I got beat up at a Neil Diamond concert by a guy named Scrunchie!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1," Well, that was pointless."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A," Say, I hope you won't think it ""evil"" of me to ask how you got that stylish head wound."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1," Oh, this old thing? I was experimenting to see if I could remove my own brain."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A," Of course! I had the same idea. I flipped a coin to decide if I should proceed. But it came up tails, so I didn't. How'd it go?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1, Well getting the brain out was the easy part. The hard part was getting the brain out!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A," Oh, you!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg 1," So, tell me about yourself."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg A," Well, don't look into it, but I'm a respected internal medicine doctor. Ooh! A can!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg 1," As for me, I design mansions, then live in them. [He bursts into tears.] [crying] I'm lying! I'm an appalling failure!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg A," [crying] Me too! A big, fat one!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg 1," And those co-workers, always looking down on us Zoidbergs. What are they, from Nob Hill?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg A," They're all like ""Stop spraying me with ink, Zoidberg!"" ""Put on pants, Zoidberg!"" ""Don't touch our fancy box, Zoidberg!"""
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg 1," Oh, that box! Too good for us, is it?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg A," Bah! Someday they'll watch from down in the gutter, they will, as King Zoidberg caresses their fancy box."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg 1," You know, maybe a certain blue lobster saw where Professor hid the box."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1," Good news, everyones!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A," After carefully reading the scriptures, we've concluded that none of us are evil."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1," Yes, the Bible is the real good news. Anyhow, you're all free to go back to your own universe."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Hermes 1, What's goin' on here? Why aren't you all out destroying the Professor's box?
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela 1," Hermes, aren't you curious about the fact that there's two of everybody?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Hermes 1," No. Now like my granny used to say back in her tarpaper shack on Montego Bay, ""If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself."""
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1, Your granny can go to hell! I've hidden the box so no one can destroy the home universe of my handsome friend here.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A," Oh, go on! Wait a second. If your Hermes was about to destroy the box containing our universe..."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1, Then your Hermes...
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A," Oh, my!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Narrator, [voice-over] And sure enough...
The Farnsworth Parabox,Hermes," Like Granny said, ""If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself."" God rest her zombie bones."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela A, So we go back through the box and stop Hermes?
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A, Right. Good thing Professor B there hid it in the coelacanth tank. No one but a crazy lobster would look there!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1, [on radio] It's gone!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg A," All hail Zoidberg, the king with the box! [He kisses Zoidberg 1's feet.] Now it's my turn, maybe?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg 1, The box says no.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Narrator," [voice-over] Meanwhile in Universe A, Hermes A heads towards the sun ... A."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Hermes, Item one  Box. Check! Item two  Sun. [He looks at the sun and shields his eyes.] That's a big check.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Hermes 1," [crying] If I know parallel Hermes, he's at the sun by now."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender 1, Our universe is doomed!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender 1 and Bender A, Doooooooomed!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1," Now don't give up yet, you cry babies. The box is gone but we still have one preposterously slim hope."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Amy A, Is it a kind of hairspray?
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A, No! We must attempt to make another box containing our universe. Doy!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry 1, Well? Is that your universe in there?
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry A, [from box] Nope. Too cold.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A, [from box] Hmm! All women! [He comes out of the box covered in lipstick marks.] I'll put this one aside for later.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Hermes 1," Oh, man, it's hopeless! We'll never find your universe in time. Plus, this box is stuck on my fat head."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1," Yes, it's the apocalypse alright. I always thought I'd have a hand in it."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender 1," I'm not sad because I finally found someone as great as me. It's like I always say, ""Make new friends and keep the old. One is silver--"""
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender A," ""And the other's gold."""
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg 1, Why with the long faces?
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela 1, The idiots have the box!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg A, I think she means you.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1, Grab them!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg 1, [shouting] You coward! Wait for me!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Amy, Blug! Which one did they go into?
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A," [sarcastic] Oh, let's all ask each other! That'll solve this problem!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1," We'll each have to search a universe. Everyone, grab a length of wire first so you can find your way back."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Amy 1, Hello? Did you see two smelly lobsters?
The Farnsworth Parabox,Hermes 25," We didn't see anything ... [Leela 25, Hermes 25 and Fry 25 turn around. They have no eyes.] ... ever!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry," Yo! Uh, did two shellfish in scrubs go by?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry 1729," Hell, no!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela 1729, Shut up!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender 1729," Beat it, jerk!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela A," Uh, have you robot versions of you guys seen any extra Zoidbergs around here?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry 31, [mechanical voice] Negative. Will you go out with me?
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela A," Uh, access denied."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender 1," Hey, pal, look what I snagged from the Leprechaun Universe!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender," Yeah, Leprechaun Universe is fine ... if you haven't seen Pirate Universe!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender 1, Faith and begorra!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth XVII, Quae?
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg A, Quick! Into another box!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg 1," There aren't any in this universe, there aren't. Hey, you, what with the no boxes?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 420," Baby, they're somewhere. Everything's like somewhere! Place is kinda au naturel right now."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1, There they are!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A, Gotcha!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 420, Dig it! All of you fitting in this boxed is like seriously freaked up!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 1," Nonsense! Why, there's a whole universe in there."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth 420," Dude, there's a universe in all of us."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Amy 420," Right on, Professor Freaksworth!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A," Get a job! [He leans over the parabox.] [shouting] We've got the box. Everyone, pull your wires."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A, Hurry! Back to Universe A!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth A," Hermes, don't press that button!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Hermes, OK.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry A, Bye.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela A," Good luck, Leela."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Zoidberg A," So long, Your Majesty!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Amy 1, Later!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry," There but for the flip of a coin go we. So, um, Leela? Seeing how the universe wasn't destroyed, you wanna catch an ape fight? You know, together?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela," Well, I guess you deserve one more flip."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Fry," So, heads or tails?"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela," Y'know, let's just say it's heads."
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth, Ready?
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth," and  One, two, three, pull!"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth, There. That space-time eversion has given us their box and vice versa.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela," So, what you think you just explained to us is that--"
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth, Correct! This box contains our own universe.
The Farnsworth Parabox,Hermes, Sweet honey bee of infinity!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Leela, Bender! Quit destroying the universe!
The Farnsworth Parabox,Bender, But--
The Farnsworth Parabox,Farnsworth," Yes, all that is and ever shall be is in that box. And the box itself is probably worth something too. We must cherish it, as we cherish every moment of our lives."
The Farnsworth Parabox,,
My Three Suns,Bender, [singing] Going through the 'bot wash!
My Three Suns,Bender, [singing] Goin' through the robot wash!
My Three Suns,"C'mon, y'all and sing it with me,",
My Three Suns,"'Bot wash! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,",
My Three Suns,"'Bot wash, yeah!",
My Three Suns,Bender, Ah!
My Three Suns,Elzar," [on TV] Hey, I'm Elzar! Welcome to the show! You know, you don't have to drive all the way to Neptune for great Neptunian food. Today we're gonna kick it up a notch as I show you how to fricassee a mouth-watering Neptunian slug. [He hoots and turns on the oven.] Now, while you grease the pan and preheat your oven to 3500 degrees, you're gonna separate the yolk from your genetically-enhanced eggplant and then give the whole thing a good blast from your spice weasel. Bam!"
My Three Suns,Fry," Hey, what you watching?"
My Three Suns,Bender," Uh, nothing!"
My Three Suns,Leela, Is that a cooking show?
My Three Suns,Bender," No, of course not! It was ... uh ... porno! Yeah, that's it!"
My Three Suns,Leela, Bender! I didn't know you liked cooking! That's so cute!
My Three Suns,Bender," [ashamed] Oh, it's true! I've been hiding it for so long."
My Three Suns,Fry," It's OK, Bender. I like cooking too."
My Three Suns,Bender, [whispering] Pansy!
My Three Suns,Elzar," [on TV] Of course, your most important ingredient is this baby right here  The Neptunian slug. You can get it in a can but to really do things right you gotta strangle yourself a fresh one. [He pulls the slug out of it's box and it grows rapidly.] Now this is why you gotta use cast-iron cookware."
My Three Suns,Hermes," Bender, man. It has come to my attention that this company has been paying you to do nothing but loaf about on the couch."
My Three Suns,Bender, You call that a couch? I demand a pillow!
My Three Suns,Hermes, I'm sorry but if you want to continue drawing a salary you gotta do more than watch the cooking shows all day.
My Three Suns,Bender, Hmm.
My Three Suns,Fry, You're gonna be the ships cook?
My Three Suns,Bender, Yeah! We're gonna kick it up a notch. Bam!
My Three Suns,Leela," I know you like cooking shows but you're a robot, you don't even have a sense of taste."
My Three Suns,Bender," Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if I was wearing a lime green tank top."
My Three Suns,Fry, Bam!
My Three Suns,Fry, So this is Little Neptune?
My Three Suns,Bender, Yep. Every chef knows that this is the place to get exotic gourmet ingredients.
My Three Suns,Leela, Among other things.
My Three Suns,Crack Addict," Come on, man! Don't hold out on me like this!"
My Three Suns,Organ Dealer, Psst! You want to buy organ? [He opens his coat to reveal human organs pinned to the inside like knock-off watches.] Fresh and cheap. Ready for transplant!
My Three Suns,Fry, [pointing] Ooh! What's this?
My Three Suns,Organ Dealer, Ah! Is X-Ray eyes. See through anything!
My Three Suns,Fry, Wait a minute! This says Z-Ray.
My Three Suns,Organ Dealer," Z is just as good. In fact, is better. Is two more than X."
My Three Suns,Fry," Hmm, I can see where that would be an advantage. Do you take cash?"
My Three Suns,Leela," Fry, you have to be more careful. We're not in the 20th century. You don't know how things work here."
My Three Suns,Fry," I'm not a little kid, Leela. I grew up in this city. These are my people. [He waves to an alien.] What up?"
My Three Suns,Alien, Word!
My Three Suns,Fry, See?
My Three Suns,Fry, Wow! You guys sell every kind of meat here except human!
My Three Suns,Neptunian Salesman #1, What? You want human?
My Three Suns,Leela, What's this spice for?
My Three Suns,Neptunian Salesman #2, That's powdered swamp root. Makes you irresistible to the opposite sex.
My Three Suns,Leela," Oh, that's ridiculous! (whispering) I'll take two pounds!"
My Three Suns,Bender," Hey, buddy. I'm looking for fresh slug."
My Three Suns,Neptunian Salesman #1, Yellow or purple?
My Three Suns,Bender, Whatever.
My Three Suns,Neptunian Salesman #1, The purple one causes terrible nightmare-ish diarrhoea.
My Three Suns,Bender," Yeah, yeah. Either one's fine."
My Three Suns,Leela," Hey, have you seen Fry?"
My Three Suns,Fry," Now that you mention it, I do have trouble breathing underwater sometimes. I'll take the gills."
My Three Suns,Organ Dealer," Yes, gills. Then, uh, you don't need lungs anymore, is right?"
My Three Suns,Fry, Can't imagine why I would.
My Three Suns,Organ Dealer," Lie down on table. I take lungs now, gills come next week. [Fry lies on the table.] (shouting) Nurse!"
My Three Suns,Nurse, Let's do it.
My Three Suns,Organ Dealer, You may feel small pain--
My Three Suns,Bender, [shouting] Thank you!
My Three Suns,Leela, What the hell were you doing? I warned you to stay away from those guys.
My Three Suns,Fry," I'm capable of making my own decisions, Leela. Did you ever stop to think I might be happier with gills?"
My Three Suns,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone--"
My Three Suns,Bender," Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that."
My Three Suns,Farnsworth, You'll be making a delivery to the planet Trisol...
My Three Suns,Bender, Here it comes.
My Three Suns,Farnsworth, A mysterious world in the darkest depths of the Forbidden Zone.
My Three Suns,Bender," Thank you, and goodnight."
My Three Suns,Leela," Uh, Professor, are we even allowed in the Forbidden Zone?"
My Three Suns,Farnsworth," Why, of course! It's just a name! Like the Death Zone or the Zone of No Return. All the zones have names like that in the Galaxy of Terror!"
My Three Suns,Leela," Uh, Professor--"
My Three Suns,Farnsworth, Off you go. Pleasant trip!
My Three Suns,Fry," [shouting] Hey, Bender, how's dinner coming?"
My Three Suns,Bender, [shouting; from galley] Almost ready!
My Three Suns,Bender, Now for a dash of salt! [He coats the slug in salt and it starts to shrivel up.] Uh-oh!
My Three Suns,Leela," [whispering] Listen, this is Bender's first meal and he's a little sensitive. So let's be supportive, OK?"
My Three Suns,Fry," Yeah, OK."
My Three Suns,Zoidberg, Alright.
My Three Suns,Leela," [shouting] Oh, dear God!"
My Three Suns,Fry," That's the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. And I've once ate a big, heaping bowl of salt!"
My Three Suns,Amy," Bender, is this salt water?"
My Three Suns,Bender, It's salt with water in it if that's what you mean.
My Three Suns,Fry, My vision's fading. I think I'm gonna die.
My Three Suns,Bender, There was nothing wrong with that food. The salt level was 10% less than a lethal dose.
My Three Suns,Zoidberg, Uh-oh! I shouldn't have had seconds.
My Three Suns,Leela," OK, Fry, here's the package to deliver. And for once in your life be careful. This is my first visit to the Galaxy of Terror and I'd like it to be a pleasant one."
My Three Suns,Fry, Ow!
My Three Suns,Leela," Don't touch anything or talk to anyone. Just go to the palace, drop it off and come right back."
My Three Suns,Fry," Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering things before you were born! I think I know what I'm doing."
My Three Suns,Fry," Stupid slug. I've never been so thirsty. [He looks across at the setting sun.] Oh, come on! Go down already! [The sun finally sets.] Ah!"
My Three Suns,Fry, Hello? Anybody home?
My Three Suns,Guard #1, The royal bottle is empty!
My Three Suns,Guard #2, You drank our Emperor!
My Three Suns,Fry, No! It wasn't me!
My Three Suns,Guard #1, [shouting] You drank our Emperor! You assassinated him!
My Three Suns,Fry, I didn't mean to. He just looked so cool and refreshing.
My Three Suns,Guard #3, I'm sure he was.
My Three Suns,Guard #1, But now he's gone and your fate is sealed. All hail the new Emperor.
My Three Suns,Guards, [chanting] Hail! Hail! Hail!
My Three Suns,Leela," So after I specifically asked you not to touch anything, you drank a bottle of strange blue liquid? It could have been poisonous acid!"
My Three Suns,Fry, It could have been. But chances were equally good it was an Emperor.
My Three Suns,Merg," Excuse me, Your Majesty, I am Merg, the High Priest. If I might interject?"
My Three Suns,Fry, You might.
My Three Suns,Merg," I humbly advise that as your first act you choose a capable Prime Minister. I suggest Gorgak, the previous appointee."
My Three Suns,Gorgak, I will be a forceful and effective administrator.
My Three Suns,Bender," You know, Fry, I've often thought about becoming a Prime Minister."
My Three Suns,Fry, I gotta go with Bender.
My Three Suns,Bender," Yes! In your face, Gorgak!"
My Three Suns,Leela," That's it, Fry. As your captain I order you back to the ship. You are in way over your head."
My Three Suns,Fry," Gee, you think so, Captain? I'd better check with my Prime Minister."
My Three Suns,Bender," Stay the course, pal!"
My Three Suns,Gorgak," Your Highness, a package came for you."
My Three Suns,Fry," Hey, thanks! [He takes the package and opens it. It is a sign saying ""Please Don't Drink The Emperor!""] Wow! This got here just in time."
My Three Suns,Merg, This is Your Majesty's harem. You may choose any of these maidens to be your royal consort.
My Three Suns,Fry," Um, how about that one?"
My Three Suns,Merg, Oh! I didn't realise Your Majesty was into that sort of thing!
My Three Suns,Fry," On second thought, I'll take that one."
My Three Suns,Merg," Hey, whatever you say. I'm not here to pass judgement."
My Three Suns,Leela," Does anyone else think it's odd that a shiftless 25-year-old delivery boy could drop out of the sky, kill the emperor and be rewarded instead of punished?"
My Three Suns,Fry," You don't have to beat around the bush, Leela. We all know who you're talking about ... uh, me, right?"
My Three Suns,Amy, I don't think you have anything to worry about. These people seem really mild-mannered.
My Three Suns,Zoidberg," They are mild. In fact, you're soaking in one right now."
My Three Suns,Gorgak, You touched me in ways I've never been touched before.
My Three Suns,Merg," Ah, there you are, Your Majesty. It's time to begin preparing for tomorrow's coronation ceremony."
My Three Suns,Zoidberg, A fancy dress gala! I'll wear my formal shell.
My Three Suns,Merg, Fry will be enthroned tomorrow at the setting of the three suns when we Trisolians enter our nocturnal phase.
My Three Suns,Fry," There won't be a lot of long-winded speeches, will there?"
My Three Suns,Merg, Only one. The absolutely flawless recitation from memory of the royal oath. By you.
My Three Suns,Fry, Will there be cake?
My Three Suns,Zoidberg," Yeah, I know."
My Three Suns,Amy, [to Gorgak] Hi!
My Three Suns,Fry, There you go.
My Three Suns,Gorgak," And now, get ready to laugh till your sides leak with our planet's foremost political satirist, Florp!"
My Three Suns,Florp," So what is the deal with people from under the orange sun? They're all... [He does a funny walk. Fry laughs.] But us guys from under the red sun, we're like... [He imitates does another funny walk.] Right? Am I right?"
My Three Suns,Fry," Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!"
My Three Suns,Leela," [whispering] Fry, I have to talk to you. You're in terrible danger."
My Three Suns,Leela," You see Emperor Plon here? [She points at a painting.] He met his end when he was drunk by Emperor Strug. And before he could even wipe his mouth, Strug was drunk by Shwab."
My Three Suns,Fry, So?
My Three Suns,Leela, Look at all these guys. Do you have any idea what the average length of their reigns was?
My Three Suns,Fry," 80,000 years?"
My Three Suns,Leela, No. One week.
My Three Suns,Fry, Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked unless it was really high or really low.
My Three Suns,Leela, Every Emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one. And guess who's next?
My Three Suns,Fry," Well, at least my assassin will get what's coming to him."
My Three Suns,Leela," You're in tremendous danger, you idiot! Half of these Emperors were drunk at their own coronation."
My Three Suns,Fry," Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis myself."
My Three Suns,Leela," No, they were assassinated. In fact, the law says you'll be killed on the spot if you fail to recite the oath from memory."
My Three Suns,Fry," Yeah, I was going to thumb through that later."
My Three Suns,Leela, That is completely reckless. Don't you ever think ahead?
My Three Suns,Fry," Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, I wouldn't be Emperor. And I wouldn't even be here in the year 3000. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar. Is any of this getting through to you?"
My Three Suns,Leela, I give up! You're gonna get yourself killed and this time I won't be here to save you.
My Three Suns,Fry," Who asked you to? I told you a hundred times to stop treating me like a baby. Now go. Go gather your nuts, you nagging grasshopper."
My Three Suns,Leela," That's it! I'm never helping you again! If anyone except you needs me, I'll be in the ship."
My Three Suns,Fry, I'll be fine. It's not like anyone's gonna drink me. [A panel slides across on a portrait and a Trisolian tries to drink Fry with a straw.] Quit it!
My Three Suns,Merg," People of Trisol, it is my honour to present your new Emperor."
My Three Suns,Fry, What up?
My Three Suns,Merg, Stick to the oath.
My Three Suns,Fry," Right! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, who drank Ungo the Moist, who guzzled Zorn the Stagnant..."
My Three Suns,Fry," (reading) Who slurped Hudge the Dewy, who enjoyed a soup composed principally of Throm the Chunky, do solemnly swear to rule with honour and insanity-- Uh, integrity!"
My Three Suns,Merg," Congratulations, Your Highness. [He takes Fry's shirt off him.] I now present you with your royal unisex robe. Long live Fry the Solid!"
My Three Suns,Bender," Hey, look. The suns are setting. I can finally switch to hard liquor!"
My Three Suns,Bender," Check out the glowing freaks. It's beautiful! Hey, what's that?"
My Three Suns,Merg, The Emperor Bont! He's still alive.
My Three Suns,Bont, Of course I'm alive. Now cut this creep open and drain me out!
My Three Suns,Fry, My tummy hurts!
My Three Suns,Bont," They're over here, they're running up the stairs."
My Three Suns,Bender," Shut up, you!"
My Three Suns,Fry, Ow!
My Three Suns,Merg, Let us in!
My Three Suns,Merg, [from outside] Fry must die so that Bont may live.
My Three Suns,Fry, What am I gonna do?
My Three Suns,Amy, We've gotta get the Emperor out of your body before they kill you!
My Three Suns,Zoidberg," Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in a high-speed centrifuge, separating out the denser fluid of His Highness."
My Three Suns,Fry, But won't that crush my bones?
My Three Suns,Zoidberg," Oh, right, right, with the bones! I always forget about the bones."
My Three Suns,Bender," Hey, why don't you just sweat him out?"
My Three Suns,Bont, Forget it! As Emperor I refuse to be dripped out through somebody's armpit.
My Three Suns,Fry, I could vomit or urinate. Would you feel better about that?
My Three Suns,Bont, Slightly. But my favourite so far is the bone-crushing.
My Three Suns,Amy, What about crying?
My Three Suns,Fry, That's a great idea! Crying.
My Three Suns,Bont, Fine. That or the bone one.
My Three Suns,Merg," Keep it up, men. The veneer is starting to peel."
My Three Suns,Gorgak," Oh, dear!"
My Three Suns,Fry, It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just too macho.
My Three Suns,Bender," I'll make you cry, buddy! [He clears his throat.] You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll never amount to anything."
My Three Suns,Fry, What do you mean? I was Emperor of a whole planet.
My Three Suns,Bender, Good point. But here's a disturbing reminder  Everyone you knew or loved in the 20th century is dead.
My Three Suns,Fry, These things happen.
My Three Suns,Bender," OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause there's no God and your idiotic human ideals are laughable!"
My Three Suns,Fry, Phew! That's a load off my mind.
My Three Suns,Bender," Man, I guess it's harder than I thought to make someone cry."
My Three Suns,Amy," You did your best, Bender."
My Three Suns,Bender," Up yours, bimbo!"
My Three Suns,Zoidberg," Let's face it, we're in hot butter here. We should call Leela for help."
My Three Suns,Bender," Cram it, lobster! [Zoidberg bursts into tears.] That is a good idea. I'll go call her."
My Three Suns,Fry, She'll never help me. She's still mad that I told her never to help me.
My Three Suns,Amy, C'mon. Leela's not the type to hold a grudge.
My Three Suns,Operator, [on phone] Collect call from...
My Three Suns,Bender, [on phone] I'm not giving my name to a machine.
My Three Suns,Leela, I'll accept.
My Three Suns,Bender, [on screen] Fry's in trouble...
My Three Suns,Bender," And he needs help. Now, I don't like you and you don't like me."
My Three Suns,Leela, [on screen] I like you.
My Three Suns,Bender," You do? Look, are you going to help or not?"
My Three Suns,Leela, [on screen] I don't know why I should. I mean after what he--
My Three Suns,Bender," Wait, wait, wait, wait. [He crosses his legs and taps his chin.] What is it you like best about me?"
My Three Suns,Amy, Is she coming?
My Three Suns,Bender, I'm not sure. But I do know that she likes my in-your-face attitude.
My Three Suns,Fry, What the hell is that?
My Three Suns,Bont," Its the Juice-A-Matic 4000. It'll strain my juices from you while filtering out the pulp. By which I mean, your shredded remains."
My Three Suns,Zoidberg, Of course! Why didn't I think of that!
My Three Suns,Fry, This is the saddest day of my life. And I still can't cry.
My Three Suns,Bender, Wait a second. Here comes Leela.
My Three Suns,Amy," Oh, no! They have her totally outnumbered."
My Three Suns,Fry, I can't believe it. She's risking her life for me after the way I treated her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.
My Three Suns,Bender, You do? Hmm.
My Three Suns,Fry, Is she alright?
My Three Suns,Bender," I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out this window. Oh, dear God in heaven, they're swarming all over her."
My Three Suns,Fry, No. No!
My Three Suns,Amy," What are you talking about, Bender? She's al-- [Bender puts his hand over Amy's mouth and she eventually catches on.] (muffled) Oh!"
My Three Suns,Bender," They're strapping her to juicer. Oh, they're putting some ice cubes in the glass under it."
My Three Suns,Fry, This can't be happening.
My Three Suns,Bender," It can and, for all you know, it is. [He puts his hand on Fry's shoulder.] I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead."
My Three Suns,Fry," All Leela ever wanted to do was help me. But I was to proud, too stupid to accept it. [He throws his crown across the room.] I wish I had died instead of her."
My Three Suns,Leela, What are you talking about?
My Three Suns,Fry, Leela! You're alive!
My Three Suns,Leela, Of course I'm alive.
My Three Suns,Bender, I told Fry you were dead so he would cry out the Emperor but you had to go and wreck it by surviving.
My Three Suns,Amy, We only got two drops.
My Three Suns,Bont, It's only a matter of time now.
My Three Suns,Zoidberg, I'll handle this!
My Three Suns,Leela," Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out of this if you're willing to let me help you."
My Three Suns,Fry," Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take all the help you're willing to give. I know you just want what's best for me. [Leela smiles then stamps on his foot.] Ow! What was that for? [She slaps him.] Hey, come on! [He bursts into tears.] That hurt!"
My Three Suns,Leela," I know. Amy, get the bottle."
My Three Suns,Fry," [crying] Oh, now I understand."
My Three Suns,Leela, Come on. Everybody help out Fry.
My Three Suns,Fry," [crying] Thanks, everybody. I love you all. You guys are true-- Ow! Cut it out, Bender! That's a tender area!"
My Three Suns,Leela," How we doing, Amy?"
My Three Suns,Amy, Great! We're one-tenth of the way there.
My Three Suns,Amy," OK, it's your turn."
My Three Suns,Fry," Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?"
My Three Suns,Bont, I'm the Emperor! Thanks for crying me out.
My Three Suns,Fry," Oh, you're welcome."
My Three Suns,Bender, [from inside] Hey! Save some for me!
My Three Suns,,
Three Hundred Big Boys,Announcer," [voice-over; on TV] This week in the universe. [The scene on the TV changes to a planet where DOOP soldiers battle giant spiders.] Dateline, Turantulon 6  The brave warriors of Earth, under the command of General Major Webelo Zapp Brannigan, have achieved victory over the spider homeworld. [Kif hits two spiders with a giant fly swat and Zapp runs him over in a Jeep.] And to the victor belong the spoils; one trillion dollars in silken treasure."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zapp, [on TV] Mmm!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Nixon," [on TV] My fellow Earthicans, after meeting with top voodoo economists, I have decided to refund our silk surplus to you, the taxpayers. That's right! I've sent you each 300 buckaroos in the form of a Tricky Dick Fun Bill. Knock yourselves out!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zoidberg, Money!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Amy, I'm slightly richer!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Bender," What to do, what to do? One $300 hookerbot or 300 $1 hookerbots?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Leela, I'm going to swim with a whale. They're the gentle giants of the deep.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Farnsworth, I'm well aware of that.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Scruffy, Scruffy's gonna get himself one of them $300 haircuts. This one's lost its pizzazz!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zoidberg," A fortune, it is! At last Zoidberg will live like a rich man!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Nixon," [on bill] Hey, cut it out! Go away! Get away!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Amy," Shmeesh! It's just 300 bucks. What is that, like a hundred cups of coffee?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Fry," That's it! I'm getting a hundred cups of coffee. Starting now. [He walks over to the coffee machine.] Coffee machine, one cup of coffee, please."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Nixon, [on bill] Smells good!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zapp, [on screen] Leela? Are you there?
Three Hundred Big Boys,Leela, No.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zapp," [on screen] Oh, yes, you are! I'm hereby inviting you and your oddball co-workers to a special reception to display the national silk surplus. I believe you know the heroic space stallion who captured it. Show them my medal, Kif."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Kif, [on screen] He rented it with his tax refund.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zapp," [on screen] So, Leela, will you have the pleasure?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Leela, What little there is to be had.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zapp, [on screen] Tomorrow night at eight them. Smooches!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Crack Addict, No cheap crack houses for me no more!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Man #1," Very good, sir. Shall I pre-warm sir's crack pipe?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Amy," Oh, Kif, it was so romantic of you to rent this paddle plane with your tax rebate. We're like two dandelion seeds wafting on the breeze."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Kif, [gasping] Yes. Seeds ... wafting.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Amy, I almost feel kinda shallow for blowing my rebate on this cool talking tattoo!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Tattoo #1," Hey, Gordon Gecko! I cost as much as this whole crummy date!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Amy, Shut up! [She slaps her arm.] Ow!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Farnsworth," Uh, ma'am, it has become too much of a chore for me to clean out my wrinkles each day. Is it true that stem cells may fight the aging process?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Geneworks Woman," Well, yes. In the same way an infant may fight Muhammad Ali. But--"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Farnsworth," One pound of stem cells, please."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Geneworks Woman," Of course, any age-reversing effects will be purely temporary."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Bender," Say, buddy, why's this Grand Cigar so pricey?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Clerk," Well, as you can see, its wrapper is a piece of the original US Constitution. It was hand-rolled by Queen Elizabeth during her wild years and was buried with George Burns until graverobbing space mushrooms-- Uh, well you know the rest."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Bender, Give you 300 bucks for it.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Clerk, No can do.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Bender," Oh, alright, I'll just take these $300 burglars tools then."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Clerk," Very good, sir."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Bender," So, uh, what time d'you close tonight?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Dwight," Hey, Pops! Did that tax rebate come?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Hermes," Came and went! You're now the proud owner of Bamboo Boogie Boots. [Dwight's smile fades.] With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Dwight," But, Pops, I don't wanna have fun. I wanna be like you; boring but prudently invested."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Hermes, Babylon's bells! I tallied almost 300 bananas on this entertainment product. Now you put 'em on and have fun.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Dwight, [shouting] I don't wanna!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Hermes," Well then I'm gonna put 'em on and make you watch me have fun. [He sits on the steps, puts the boots on, stands up and smiles.] See? Fun! Fun-- [The bamboo comes out of the bottom of the boots and lifts Hermes into the air. He screams.] Dwight! Help me!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Dwight," I'll save you, Pops!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Farnsworth, Hey! Turn that damn music-- [A woman looks up at him] Up!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Hermes, Isn't this fun?
Three Hundred Big Boys,Dwight, No! I wish I had two mommies!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Randy," Try these, uh, sir."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zoidberg, I ask for rich guy stuff and you give me shiny pebbles? Bah! I bid you adieu.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Randy, Ow!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Leela," I'd like a pass to swim with Mushu, please."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Whale Biologist, Well you asked the right guy. I'm the whale biologist. Though personally I hate whales. [whispering] Especially Mushu.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Leela, Then why'd you become a whale biologist?
Three Hundred Big Boys,Whale Biologist," I don't know you well enough to get into that. $300, please. [Leela hands him her $300 and he hands her a card.] Noon tomorrow. If you're late you only get to tread water in the scallop tank."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Fry," Uh, I'll have a coffee."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Man #2," Guppy, trout, mermaid or--"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Fry," Whale, please."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Kif," [gasping] Amy, I-I also spent some of my tax rebate on a gift for you."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Amy," Oh, Kiffie!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Kif," It shows the time wherever we both are. And it's powered by love! Also, you have to wind it."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Tattoo #1, Oh! Somebody won big at Skeeball!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Amy," You shut up! I love it, Kif. I'll use it whenever I wanna know what time it is. [She kisses and hugs him. She looks down and sees Fry and Leela sat at a table.] Ooh! It's Fry and Leela! [shouting] Hi, Fry and Leela!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Kif," Oh! Keep peddling! Oh, for the love of God, keep peddling!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Amy," [shouting] Bye, Fry and Leela!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Tattoo #1," Oh, I can't wait until the tattoos on Amy's butt hear about this!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Tattoo #2, Hear about what?
Three Hundred Big Boys,Tattoo #3, Tell us!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Amy," Don't feel sad, my little tadpole."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Kif, [crying] I'm trying not to. But my gift to you is in the belly of a whale.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zoidberg," Say, this reminds me of that time I ate that other watch Kif gave you."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Amy," Hey, it is kinda like that."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zoidberg," To induce vomiting, that was the solution. Everywhere it went! [He chuckles.] What a Valentine's Day that was!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Leela," Hmm. This may seem like a huge coincidence, but I happen to have an in with that whale."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Scruffy," Scruffy's formulated a plan, but you'll need a ready source of nauseatin' rotten fish."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Elzar," Freshen your coffee, sir?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Fry," Yeah, yeah, yeah! Keep it coming! Put the pot down! Get away!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,April, You're so young in spirit. It's hard to believe you're as old as 25.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Farnsworth, The key is to grab life by the hojos! Live every day like it might be your last.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Elzar," What'll it be, kids?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Farnsworth, One bowl of mild farina.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Leela, Pay dirt! [She closes the door and pulls the plug out of the socket.] Hi-yah!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Elzar," Here you go, big spender. Foie gras and caviar."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zoidberg, Goose liver? Fish eggs? [He eats it and spits it out.] Pah! Where's the goose? Where's the fish?
Three Hundred Big Boys,Elzar," Hey, that's what rich people eat. The garbage parts of the food."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zoidberg," I ate garbage yesterday and it didn't cost me $300! I'm not paying. [He puts on a top hat.] Farewell, good sir!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Bender, Le Grand Cigar! She is mine! And with absolutely no consequences.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Smitty, You see that?
Three Hundred Big Boys,URL," Grand theft tobacco. Time to get off our fat, cop asses and ride!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Elzar, Pee-yew! This fish is slightly too rotten to even make jambalaya.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Amy," [whispering] So far, so good. Where's Kif?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Fry, [shouting] This isn't Yemeni! It's Sulawesi! [He spits it out.] And the cup's shaking! I don't want my coffee shaking!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Bender," You seem a tad wound up, buddy. And your face is greasy. Real greasy! You been up all night?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Fry, Of course I've been up all night! Not because of caffeine. It was insomnia. I couldn't stop thinking about coffee. I need a nap. [He goes to sleep for less than a second and wakes up and grabs a cup of coffee.] Coffee time!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Bender, Ah! Mighty fine smokable!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Fry," Fancy cigar. Why don't you smoke it already? Puff, puff! Go, go, go, go, go!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Bender," Nah, you can't blow the smoke from such a majestic stogie in just anyone's face. I'm saving it for the fancy-pantses at Zapp Brannigan's black tie reception. You comin'?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Whale Biologist, And the fifth reason whales kill is for the sheer fun of it.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Leela, Anything else?
Three Hundred Big Boys,Whale Biologist," Yeah. You're lumpy and you smell awful. [Leela glares.] Hey, I calls 'em like I sees 'em! I'm a whale biologist."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Leela," OK, Mushu, it's feeding time! [She dives in, not stopping to look at the ""Please Do Not Feed The Whale"" sign. Chewing sounds come from beneath the water and Leela comes up at the side of the tank gasping for air and not wearing her swimming costume.] Oh, crud! He ate my suit."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Whale Biologist, The suit was ugly. Whale biologist!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Caddy," Perhaps if you tightened your grip, sir?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zoidberg," Ah! Thank you, golf slave. [He tightens his grip and cuts through the golf club.] Bah! Rich people wouldn't waste their time on this nonsense. Plus, these eggs are gritty and tasteless."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Farnsworth, Ow! Not so rough!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Whale Biologist," Ladies and gentlemen, presenting Mushu, the educated whale who thinks he's better than you."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Amy," C'mon, Mushu! Barf! Barf like a freshman!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Whale Biologist," And now, ignorant whale lovers, we'll see who's boss as I make Mushu jump through this hoop. Jump, Mushu! [Mushu jumps but he is so sick that he has to stop halfway through the ring.] Who wants a fish?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Sam, Mushu is sad!
Three Hundred Big Boys,URL, It just keeps comin' and comin'.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Kif," Wait! That chunk. It's the watch! [Kif runs down the bleachers and dives into the water. The crowd cheers. He comes up in the middle of the vomit holding the watch.] I got it, Amy! I got it! The plan went off without a--"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Whale Biologist, He's got aquarium property! Stop him!
Three Hundred Big Boys,URL, Better do what he says. He's a whale biologist.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Smitty," You're under arrest, you squishy punk!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zapp," The Spiderians, though weak and woman-like on the battlefield, are masters of the textile arts. Taste like king crab, by the way. Crazy bugs actually wove this tapestry of my heroic conquest while I was still killing them."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zoidberg," What? It's not even scratch and sniff? But if rich people think it's good, I'll buy it. [He waves his $300 around.] One art, please!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Mom," What a clever impersonation of a stupid, poor person. How much is that placemat actually worth, Brannigan?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zapp, Exactly $1 billion.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Mom, Now that's walking-around money!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Nixon, [on bill] What? Hey! Wait! Aroo!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Whitey," So I said to Kitty, ""The only way to keep the butler from running away is to cut off his foot."" [Bender chuckles unenthusiastically and lights his cigar.] Yes, it reminds me of a joke I heard about upper-middle-class people."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Amy, [crying] I've never been sad at a party before. I wonder if my mind is thinking about Kif being in jail.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Scruffy," Jail's not so bad. You can make sangria in the terlet. Course, it's shank or be shanked."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Amy, [crying] Of course.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Whale Biologist," Look, just give back our property and we'll drop the charges."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Kif," Fine, have the watch. It's broken anyway."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Whale Biologist, I don't want your watch. You're covered in precious ambergris.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Kif, Precious ... hamburgers?
Three Hundred Big Boys,Holo-Roseanne," Ambergris. Noun. A grease-like product of the sperm whales digestive tract that is used as a base in the finest perfumes. This has been Roseanne, your guide to the world of facts."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Whale Biologist, You heard Roseanne. Scrape off the priceless ambergris and I'll let you go.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Kif," Or-Or better yet, I'll simply shed my skin."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Morbo, Stop it! Stop it! It's fine! I will destroy you!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Farnsworth," Wha? [His stem cells start to come away from his skin and his gasps. His hands go wrinkly, his hairline recedes, his face goes floppy and his ears go hairy.] Uh, gotta go. Uh, fight club!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,April," What's happening, Hubie?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Farnsworth, I'm afraid the face you fell in love with was actually just a blob of living gunk I bought with my tax refund.
Three Hundred Big Boys,April," Well as long as we're being honest, I also spent my tax refund on a crazy treatment."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Farnsworth, That certainly is honest.
Three Hundred Big Boys,April," It's better for us to both just be ourselves. You, wrinkled as a prune."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Farnsworth," You, fat as the queen of sea cows."
Three Hundred Big Boys,April, I love you!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Farnsworth," Oh, my!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Kif," So, you see, the putrid, waxy substance I was coated with was--"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Amy, Not precious ambergris!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Kif," Yes! And I managed to sneak some out in the usual place. Ta-da! [He hands it to Amy.] Using that, I'll make you a perfume of lilac and jasmine and frankenberry."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Amy," Oh, Kif, it's so romantic I can't even wait! I'm gonna wear it right now."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Mom, Who smells like freaking porpoise hork?
Three Hundred Big Boys,Amy," I do! Kiss me, Kif!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zoidberg," [crying] Oh, what a foolish squid I've been. I'm not rich. I can't even buy one measly masterpiece."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Gus," Pardon us, gent. Might a couple of hungry, hungry hobos take a feed from that aluminum snack box?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zoidberg," So now I'm in the gutter, surrounded by bums who eat garbage? Money brought me no happiness. Bupkiss!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Dandy Jim, Ooh! This boot's got a little pudding at the bottom.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Beeler," Interestingly, the Spiderians are more closely related to our elephants than our spiders."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Hermes, [shouting] Don't mind us!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Nixon, The loot! The loot! The loot is on fire!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zapp," Leela, my precious rock tub. I'll save you!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Kif, Everyone! To the fire door!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Leela, It's on fire!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Farnsworth," We're trapped, my sweet hippopotamus!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Fry," Coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee!"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Dwight," Where are we, Pops?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Farnsworth, Wha?
Three Hundred Big Boys,April, What happened to the food?
Three Hundred Big Boys,Leela, I think we were saved by a mysterious orange blur.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Zoidberg," Welcome, one and all. I finally figured out how money could make me happy. By using it to buy my hungry friends a feast."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Dandy Jim, Everyone join us. Oysters Rockefeller here has provided genuine turkey dogs!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Whitey," Heck, you're never too rich to enjoy a free turkey dog."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Amy, Yeah!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Bender, Alright! Turkey dog!
Three Hundred Big Boys,April, I'll take four!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Leela, Me too!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Mom," Oh, what the hell."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Hermes," Here, Dwight. The boots only cost $299.99. You invest this penny like you wanted."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Dwight," Thanks, Dad. I'm gonna take this and buy five shares of Amazon.com."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Hermes, A risk-taker? That's my boy!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Nixon," The entire surplus is gone! Oh, what a McGovern I've been! Why did I have to issue that crooked tax rebate?"
Three Hundred Big Boys,Leela, At least we got a few mildly interesting stories out of it.
Three Hundred Big Boys,Farnsworth," Oh, my, yes."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Bender," Speaking of which, my story kinda petered out without me learning a lesson."
Three Hundred Big Boys,Smitty, There he is!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Bender, Alright! Closure!
Three Hundred Big Boys,Holo-Roseanne," [over credits] Futurama. Noun. Um, I don't know, you just watched it, dummy. What are you asking me for? Hey, here's a fun definition  Idiot. Noun. You! [She laughs and snorts.] This has been Roseanne, your guide to the world of facts."
Three Hundred Big Boys,,
Spanish Fry,John DiMaggio, Prepare for the stereophonic experience.
Spanish Fry,Bender," Aw, New New York City! Woooo! Woooo! Don' worry about it! Do the robot, baby!"
Spanish Fry,Farnsworth," Oh, Lord! Hiking is always such a strain on the buttocks."
Spanish Fry,Fry, Shh! What was that sound?
Spanish Fry,Bender," It wasn't a bird's nest falling. That sounds like this. [He shakes a branch and a nest falls off it and breaks when it hits the ground. The two birds in it fly away, twittering.] Aww, they're so cute when they're scared."
Spanish Fry,Fry," I meant the sound Bigfoot just made. He's been sighted a lot in this area recently. Just last week, a blind hiker felt him."
Spanish Fry,Farnsworth," Don't tell me you actually believe in Bigfoot, you blathering ninny-hammer."
Spanish Fry,Fry," Of course I do! Bigfoot's my hero. Growing up, he was the celebrity I most identified with."
Spanish Fry,Zoidberg, Why?
Spanish Fry,Fry, 'Cause he was a loner who hated the popular monsters yet longed to be one.
Spanish Fry,Zoidberg, [sadly] I can so relate to that.
Spanish Fry,Leela," Ugh! Enough emotions! This isn't a fat camp, for God's sake. [quietly] Although you wouldn't know it from looking."
Spanish Fry,Zoidberg," Bender, if you want to sleep in the tent tonight, you're welcome to join me and Hermes for a little ""just friends"" spooning."
Spanish Fry,Bender," Nah, I'm comfy out here under the stars. [The trees collapse on top of him.] Real comfy!"
Spanish Fry,Ranger Park," Hey, I'm Ranger Park, the park ranger."
Spanish Fry,Fry, I get it!
Spanish Fry,Ranger Park," Now since this area's a national Bigfoot preserve, we'll start with a short film about Bigfoot while I make a few phone calls."
Spanish Fry,Narrator," [voice-over; in movie] Bigfoot ... [A hand stamps some words over the caption.] ... Endangered Mystery! [The movie shows a map of North America.] In the dense forests of the Pacific Northwest ... [The scene changes to the Patterson-Gimlin film.] ... dwells the strange and beautiful creature known as Bigfoot, perhaps."
Spanish Fry,Fry, That proves it!
Spanish Fry,Narrator," [voice-over; in movie] Sadly, logging and human settlement today threaten what might possibly be his habitat. Although if it's not, they don't. Bigfoot populations require vast amounts of land to remain elusive in. [The scene changes to some rocks.] They typically dwell just behind rocks but are also sometimes playful, bounding into thick fogs and out-of-focus areas."
Spanish Fry,Ranger Park," It should say ""Top Quality Exercycle For Sale"" and could you put ""top quality"" in bold? You can't? OK, whatever."
Spanish Fry,Narrator," [voice-over; in movie] Remember, it's up to us. Bigfoot is a crucial part of the ecosystem, if he exists. So let's all help keep Bigfoot possibly alive for future generations to enjoy unless he doesn't exist. The end."
Spanish Fry,Ranger Park," I-I gotta call you back. [He hangs up.] Alright, questions?"
Spanish Fry,Sal, Yeah. Have yous ever seens Bigfeet?
Spanish Fry,Ranger Park," Technically, no. But I do see him each night in my dreams and each day in the smiling faces of hairy children."
Spanish Fry,Farnsworth, [shouting] Bunk! Bunk I say! Bring me a bag full of Bigfoot's droppings or shut up!
Spanish Fry,Ranger Park, [holding up a bag] I have the droppings of someone who saw Bigfoot.
Spanish Fry,Farnsworth, Shut up!
Spanish Fry,Bender," Oh, my God! Look! It's Bigfoot!"
Spanish Fry,Ranger Park, Where?
Spanish Fry,Bender," Eh, he's gone. He said you should keep wasting your life though."
Spanish Fry,Petunia, Oh! I saw Bigfoot crushing cars at the county fair.
Spanish Fry,Ranger Park, What you saw was Bigfoot the monster truck. But thanks for a great question.
Spanish Fry,Fry," Sir, if I may, why don't you just set up like a billion video cameras in the woods and see if he walks by one?"
Spanish Fry,Ranger Park," Ah, that would be very expensive, and most people who believe in Bigfoot are broke."
Spanish Fry,Bender," Hey, look! Bigfoot! He's back!"
Spanish Fry,Ranger Park, Where?
Spanish Fry,Bender, Up your face! [He laughs.] Everybody do the Bender!
Spanish Fry,Amy, The sky out here is amazing. Look at all those satellites.
Spanish Fry,Farnsworth," Goodnight, employees."
Spanish Fry,Hermes, Goodnight.
Spanish Fry,Zoidberg," Goodnight, Hubert."
Spanish Fry,Fry," You doin' alright out there, buddy?"
Spanish Fry,Bender, Better than these gnats! [He zaps a few more and laughs.] That guy won't be goin' home to his kids.
Spanish Fry,Bender," Who's that? A wolf? Or some kind of boogen? Oh, God, I wish I was safe inside a tent. [He hides behind a rock.] [deep voice] Fry! Fry wake up! It's me, Bigface!"
Spanish Fry,Bender, [from outside] Come out and groom my mangy fur!
Spanish Fry,Fry, [turning on his lamp] Huh? Bigfoot? You taught yourself English?
Spanish Fry,Fry, Bigfoot? Bigfoot?
Spanish Fry,Fry," Bigfoot? Is that you? I'm not like the others, Bigfoot; I see through your monster coatings to the gentle loner inside. I bet you have a wounded racoon friend that you tenderly nurse back to health while you go... [He ""coos"".] But in the end they shoot you. But you teach us about things. [He walks into a clearing and looks around. Birds fly out from trees and the ground begins to shake. A strong wind blows leaves and things past Fry and a darkened flying saucer appears from over the trees. It lights up and beam of light engulfs Fry. He looks up and unshields his eyes.] Oh. Just a flying saucer. [shouting] Excuse me? You can't park here. The parking area's over there. [A tube extends from the spacecraft and zigzags around à la the Windows 3D Pipes screensaver.] Wow! Nice tube. [It sucks him up.] Hey! Hey, what's the big idea? Stop abducting me. Why does your vanity plate say ""Probe 1""?"
Spanish Fry,Leela," There's nothing so refreshing as the clean, crisp taste of this bold Canadian beer."
Spanish Fry,Hermes," Well, see you in an hour. I gotta go do some business behind that tree."
Spanish Fry,Amy," Bender, wasn't that Fry's tent?"
Spanish Fry,Bender," [mocking] ""Bender""!"
Spanish Fry,Leela, Bender raises a good point  Where is Fry?
Spanish Fry,Fry," Amy, you won't believe what happened ... [She looks up.] ... it was so scary that you wouldn't-- [She screams and runs.] I know, but listen, it gets even scarier."
Spanish Fry,Farnsworth, Fry! What in Sega Genesis happened to you?
Spanish Fry,Fry, That's what I'm trying to tell you. See-- [The staff gather around.] Why are you all staring at me like that? Is there something on my face?
Spanish Fry,Hermes, Uh ... no.
Spanish Fry,Leela, Someone should tell him.
Spanish Fry,Fry, Tell me what?
Spanish Fry,Leela, Nothing.
Spanish Fry,Zoidberg," Well I have a lot of experience telling patients bad news, so let me break it to him gently. [He shakes him.] [shouting] Fry, you have no nose! Your nose is gone! You have no nose on your face! Where it is I can't say but on your face it's not!"
Spanish Fry,Fry, What?
Spanish Fry,Bender," Aww! I think it's sweet. You chopped off your nose so you could look more like your hero. Me, Bender!"
Spanish Fry,Fry, [poking his face] My God! They must have taken it last night.
Spanish Fry,Farnsworth, Which last night?
Spanish Fry,Fry," In the woods. I was walking ... for Bigfoot, looking ... and then aliens beamed me up."
Spanish Fry,Amy, Were they little grey dudes with big oval heads? [Fry taps where his nose would be.] I don't get that gesture. Am I wrong?
Spanish Fry,Zoidberg," Cheer up, friend. When we get home a high-quality prosthesis will have you looking good as new."
Spanish Fry,Fry, I'm a pathetic freak. My life is ruined.
Spanish Fry,Hermes," Man, you are such a jokester!"
Spanish Fry,Fry, I'll never have another moment of happiness.
Spanish Fry,Leela," I know you're trying to mask your pain with humour, but don't worry. I'm sure the Professor can clone you a new nose."
Spanish Fry,Fry," [taking off the glasses] Eh, it wouldn't be the same. I want my nose. I don't want to have to teach a new one how to shoot milk when I laugh."
Spanish Fry,Farnsworth," Well there's no sense fretting. Good Lord, you're ugly! The fact is your nose is gone and we'll never find out who did it or why."
Spanish Fry,Bender, [gasping] Guys! Guys! There's something on television.
Spanish Fry,Linda," [on TV] Alien abductions  Until now, a harmless nuisance. But recently they've taken on a sinister dimension as unsuspecting victims are returned ... without noses."
Spanish Fry,Fry, Like me!
Spanish Fry,Morbo," [on TV] The culprits  Shameless poachers, hunting humans without a permit."
Spanish Fry,Linda," [on TV] The valuable nose, or ""human horn"", fetches a high price on alien worlds as an aphrodisiac."
Spanish Fry,Fry, My nose is an aphrodisiac? [He retches.] I'm gonna drop a barf!
Spanish Fry,Morbo," [on TV] Demand for human horn is great, due, in part, to titillating scenes from depraved alien TV programmes too filthy for Earth broadcast. Let's watch."
Spanish Fry,Neptunian Woman, [on TV] Human horn? But ... it is forbidden!
Spanish Fry,Neptunian Man, [on TV] So is our love.
Spanish Fry,Fry, Blech! We have to track down my nose before some alien snarfs it and does the worm. Who's in?
Spanish Fry,Leela, Me and Bender and maybe Zoidberg if he feels like it.
Spanish Fry,Zoidberg," No, I'm good."
Spanish Fry,Alien," Let's see, I'll take a pancreas, two sphincters and a large Coke."
Spanish Fry,Vendor, One number three combo!
Spanish Fry,Fry," It's no use. We've been to every scuzzy bazaar in the galaxy, including Pottery Barn."
Spanish Fry,Leela, Wait. What's that?
Spanish Fry,Salesman," Welcome, friends. How may I pervert you?"
Spanish Fry,Fry," Uh, I'm looking for human horn."
Spanish Fry,Salesman," [whispering] Shh! You're not cops, right?"
Spanish Fry,Leela," Of course not. In fact, he's a crook."
Spanish Fry,Bender, Yep. Stolen Pez anyone?
Spanish Fry,Salesman, Right this way.
Spanish Fry,Salesman, Human horn. So fresh you can still see the eyeglass marks.
Spanish Fry,Fry, Nope. Uh-uh. Ew! [He pulls out a photo of him and Slurms MacKenzie and points at his nose on the photo.] Now look. This is the nose we want. Did you sell it to somebody?
Spanish Fry,Salesman," I'm sorry, sir, but due to the perverted nature of our business, customer records are strictly confidential. [Leela punches him.] Right this way."
Spanish Fry,Salesman," I video-tape everyone who comes in here so I can blackmail them later. [The crew gag.] Hey, I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Here's the weirdo who bought your horn."
Spanish Fry,Leela, That's Lrrr! Ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8.
Spanish Fry,Lrrr," [on TV] You got any, uh, you know, uh [muttering] human horn?"
Spanish Fry,Salesman, [on TV] Speak up! You're muttering!
Spanish Fry,Lrrr," [on TV] I said, uh [whispering] human horn?"
Spanish Fry,Salesman," [whispering; on TV] You're not a cop, right?"
Spanish Fry,Lrrr," [on TV] Oh, no, no. I'm just some guy ... ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8!"
Spanish Fry,Lrrr," So let me get this straight  If I buy eight Caramello bars, you all get to go to some camp."
Spanish Fry,Bender, Yep. That's exactly the lie we used to get past your guards.
Spanish Fry,Fry," Oh, great space king, I humbly beg you to return my human horn."
Spanish Fry,Lrrr," Uh, human horn? How ridiculous! Why would a virile male like Lrrr need human horn? I don't even know what it's for. What is it, something you-you put in salad dressing?"
Spanish Fry,Nd-Nd, Like you've ever seen a salad.
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, My weight is appropriate and attractive!
Spanish Fry,Leela, Whoa! You guys have issues.
Spanish Fry,Lrrr," She has issues! I'm fine! But there's no human horn around here, so make friends with the door."
Spanish Fry,Fry, [sadly] Alright. I give up. I guess I'll just go home and marry a skunk.
Spanish Fry,Nd-Nd," Oh, let's just give it to him. [She picks up a box.] Here."
Spanish Fry,Fry, My nose! Light of my face!
Spanish Fry,Lrrr," Uh, what is that? How do you have that, Nd-Nd? [He pulls his cape string like a collar.] I've never seen it before. My friend left it here."
Spanish Fry,Leela," Hold still, Fry. I can reattach it with my emergency face laser."
Spanish Fry,Fry, Hey! You burned my cheek!
Spanish Fry,Leela," Yeah, sorry, I wasn't really concentrating."
Spanish Fry,Fry," No, I mean the singed flesh, I can smell it! [He sniffs.] And those lilacs on the table."
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, At least someone noticed.
Spanish Fry,Nd-Nd," For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your first wife was the one who liked lilacs."
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, She also liked to shut up!
Spanish Fry,Fry," Well, great seeing you. I guess we'll be on our--"
Spanish Fry,Bender," Yo, Highness. Uh, just out of robo-curiosity, why would you use a guy's nose for an aphrodisiac instead of his, you know, wing-dang-doodle?"
Spanish Fry,Lrrr," But, uh, I thought the horn was the human wing-dang-doodle."
Spanish Fry,Bender," No, sir, chief! The main event, so to speak, is downstairs near the wallet. Ever seen soccer players line up to block a free kick? They ain't covering their noses, I'll tell you that much. Well, see you!"
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, Interesting. The trousers conceal a tiny secondary horn.
Spanish Fry,Fry," Hey, what've you heard?"
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, [shouting] Guards! Seize him! [They do. Fry screams.] Prepare to harvest the lower horn!
Spanish Fry,Fry," OK, you can have my nose."
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, Guards!
Spanish Fry,Guard #1, Yeah?
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, Remove the human's lower horn and prepare it to be eaten by me.
Spanish Fry,Nd-Nd," In other words, slop a lot of ketchup and salt on it."
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, Then bring it to our royal bedchamber and put it in the sock drawer with all the other things that have failed to arouse my passion for this woman.
Spanish Fry,Guard #2, Remove pants!
Spanish Fry,Fry, Wait! Listen. I'm usually the first guy to toot my own lower horn--
Spanish Fry,Bender, [shouting] I'll say!
Spanish Fry,Fry, But in this case I-I just don't think it'll do any good.
Spanish Fry,Bender, [shouting] That's what she said!
Spanish Fry,Leela," Let's face it, you two have deep relationship problems that can't be solved by an aphrodisiac."
Spanish Fry,Fry, However huge it might be.
Spanish Fry,Nd-Nd," So what do you suggest, painfully-single human?"
Spanish Fry,Leela," Well, why don't you think back to what brought you together in the first place?"
Spanish Fry,Nd-Nd," Oh, I don't know. Lrrr used to be so tender."
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, I only wrote that poem to test my printer.
Spanish Fry,Nd-Nd, We'd go walking in the woods and Lrrr would find injured little tinkle-bunnies and nurse them back to health.
Spanish Fry,Lrrr," Yes, but I'm the one who injured them!"
Spanish Fry,Nd-Nd," Oh, shush. You stepped on them by accident and then you cried all night. That's the kind of sensitive man you used to be."
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, And you used to wear a size-3 cape. [shouting] But not anymore! Now bring me that lower horn while I'm still in the mood.
Spanish Fry,Fry, Wh-What if we helped you get your passion back without the hassle of mutilating me?
Spanish Fry,Leela," Yeah, we know a great place in the mountains. We could take you there for a romantic dinner under the stars."
Spanish Fry,Nd-Nd, Hmm. Sounds interesting. But he would never do it.
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, Like hell I wouldn't. I'm not gonna be blamed for not going.
Spanish Fry,Fry, Then it's a deal. We get one night. I keep my horn as long as you two end up doing the horizontal monster mash.
Spanish Fry,Bender, I don't get it!
Spanish Fry,Bender, Bonjour. May I offer you a box of wine for the edge of the table?
Spanish Fry,Lrrr," No, thanks. Just water, please. Tap water!"
Spanish Fry,Nd-Nd," [sarcastic] Oh, big spender!"
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, [shouting] That's it! This date is over. Waiter!
Spanish Fry,Fry," So, what can I get you this evening?"
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, Your lower horn!
Spanish Fry,Fry," I'll just start you off with some bread. Some sexy, arousing bread!"
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, Fine! But none of that whole-grain goat food. And bring plenty of melted butter.
Spanish Fry,Nd-Nd, Why don't you just inject some fat straight into your ass and cut out the middle man?
Spanish Fry,Lrrr," One of these days, Nd-Nd. Bang! Zoom! Straight to the third moon of Omicron Persei 8!"
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, [eating] Mmm! This jerked chicken is good. I think I'll have Fry's lower horn jerked.
Spanish Fry,Bender, [shouting] It's used to it!
Spanish Fry,Fry," So, uh, how are you two snooky-poopums doing?"
Spanish Fry,Nd-Nd, Poorly.
Spanish Fry,Lrrr," My wife is right, for once. There's very little magic in the air. Ready the lower horn transport vessel."
Spanish Fry,Bender," Boy, who knew a cooler could also make a handy wang coffin? [He takes a six pack out of his chest cabinet.] Hey, uh, mind if I stick these in here?"
Spanish Fry,Guard #1, Go for it.
Spanish Fry,Leela," Don't worry, Fry. Things look bad but I still have a trump card; the most beautiful love song ever written."
Spanish Fry,"(singing badly) And I will always love you,",
Spanish Fry,[The Omicronians cover their ears.],
Spanish Fry,Will always love you.,
Spanish Fry,Nd-Nd, The humans are attacking!
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, Pluck the lower horn and let's get out of here!
Spanish Fry,Bender," Quick, Fry! Run for it!"
Spanish Fry,Fry," Come on, freedom cage! Roll me to safety! [It flips over and rolls through a campfire, setting it and Fry alight. It hits a tree and the door falls open. Fry steps out and pats out the fire.] Yes! I never thought I'd escape with my doodle, but I pulled it out!"
Spanish Fry,Bender, [shouting] Just like at the movie theatre!
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, Give me that!
Spanish Fry,Fry, Bigfoot! He's real! I knew it! The Loch Ness Monster's book was right!
Spanish Fry,Lrrr," Well, hello there, my furry friend."
Spanish Fry,Nd-Nd," Look at his adorable little feet. [Bigfoot bangs his chest, growls and throws leaves into the air. Lrrr chuckles.] Yes, you are a cutie-pie."
Spanish Fry,Ranger Park," Holy macaroni! [He takes some photos.] I can't believe I'm seeing Bigfoot! He's in focus! Oh, I've waited my entire life for this moment."
Spanish Fry,Nd-Nd, What?
Spanish Fry,Bender, What are you doing with that?
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, You're going to kill this innocent giganto?
Spanish Fry,Ranger Park, Of course not. I'm just gonna tranquilize him so I can chop off his feet as proof he exists. Then dump him back in the wild. He'll do fine.
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, You'll have to get through me first.
Spanish Fry,Ranger Park, OK. Nighty night!
Spanish Fry,Lrrr," Now leave this gentle Sasquatch, or Wood Ape, in peace so I can finally and at long last harvest this pathetic human's lower horn."
Spanish Fry,Fry, Yeah!
Spanish Fry,Lrrr," Wait. What am I saying? If I poach this beast's lower horn, am I any better than that ranger with his demented foot lust? Yes. But not by enough."
Spanish Fry,Ranger Park, Score!
Spanish Fry,Lrrr," This human's lower horn is one of God's creatures, a living thing, and all living things, large and small--"
Spanish Fry,Bender," [shouting] In this case ""small""!"
Spanish Fry,Lrrr, Have dignity and a spark of the divine.
Spanish Fry,Nd-Nd," That's the gentle, sensitive, poet warlord I fell in love with."
Spanish Fry,Lrrr," [shouting] Uh, you'll wanna retreat to a safe, 500-metre radius!"
Spanish Fry,Leela," Well, Fry, it looks like you get to hold onto your lower horn."
Spanish Fry,Bender, As usual! [He hoots.] [shouting] Run away!
Spanish Fry,Narrator," [voice-over; on TV] You're on a scenic route through a state recreation known as the human mind. You ask a passer-by for directions, only to find he has no face or something. Suddenly, up ahead, a door in the road. You swerve, narrowly avoiding The Scary Door."
Spanish Fry,Scientist, [on TV] I have combined the DNA of the world's most evil animals to make the most evil creature of them all.
Spanish Fry,Man, [on TV] It turns out it's Man.
Spanish Fry,,
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," Huh? [He scratches his ass and looks at some signs on Fry's bedroom door. ""No Trespassing"", ""Keep Out"", ""Private"", ""Keep Out Bender"" and a picture of Bender with a cross through it.] I choose to not understand these signs."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender, Aha!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, Bender? I was just not playing the holophonor.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," Yeah, well you should try not stinking at it."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, I am trying. I've been taking lessons.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," Lessons? Oh, that's rich! Isn't it time you gave up all hope of ever improving yourself in any way?"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry," I know I should but I just can't. Remember when I had those stomach worms that made me smart? I could play the holophonor and it made Leela like me. [He picks up a photo of Leela and him riding on the back of an angry looking Zoidberg.] Hey, Bender, as long as you know, I have a holophonor recital Tuesday. I'd really like to have somebody there. Please?"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," Fine, I'll go already. Y'know, sometimes I wish your real parents were still alive. Not often, though."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender, Whoa! Hey!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry," Uh, hello, Mrs. Mellonger."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Mrs. Mellonger," Hello, Philip. [She looks at Bender.] And you must be Mr. Bender. Philip's told me so much about you. Is it true that you're a robot?"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," I prefer the term ""love machine""."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender, Wow! Your kid is great. How hard did you say you had to hit him?
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Mother, Fairly hard.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, The Grumpy Snail. [He plays the holophonor. An image of a grumpy snail slowly crawling along a branch forms. He plays a bad note and the snail turns around and glares at him angrily.] Sorry!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Boy, [crying] It's too grumpy!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, Ow! No! Quit it! Stop!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Mrs. Mellonger," Mr. Bender, I simply cannot teach your child."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," Then good day, madam! [He pushes Fry through the door and closes it behind him. He opens it again and pokes his head back into the room.] We hope to see you soon for tea."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, It's hopeless! I can hear all this great music in my head but my stupid hands can't keep up.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender, Aww. You know what always cheers me up? Laughing at other people's misfortunes.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela," Hey, guys. You missed a great delivery to Space Earth. Where you been all afternoon?"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry," At, uh, uh, a concert."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela, Ooh! Was it jazz noodling? My ex-boyfriend Sean played the sax. I used to listen for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein, huh?"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela," Yeah, it's weird; Sean was uneducated, unambitious. He was pastey and hunched--"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, [quietly] Pretty boy.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela," But when he played I could sense this incredible, beautiful creative soul. Then one day I found someone else's couch fibres on his butt. [muttering] I couldn't believe it. I was really..."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, That could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch if I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," Oh, but you can. Though you may have to metaphorically make a ""deal with the devil"". And by ""devil"" I mean ""Robot Devil"". And by ""metaphorically"" I mean ""get your coat""."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," You hit a sour note about 200 years back, Doug! [Doug, the Hellbot with the saxophone, hangs his head in shame.] Let's take it from the top. [Enter Bender and Fry on the slide. They land at the Robot Devil's feet.] Ah, Bender, Fry. You've come back for more eternal damnation."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," No, this isn't a religious visit. Fry just wants holophonor lessons."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, Yep. I need to get really good without practising.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," Hell is full of ten-year-olds who wanted exactly the same thing. Trouble is, you have what my old music teacher, Mrs. Mellonger, calls ""stupid fingers"". [He twiddles his own fingers then slaps them.] With hands like that you'll be lucky to master a belt buckle. [Fry looks down and sees his trousers have fallen around his ankles. He quickly pulls them up.] Now wouldn't it be nice if you had a pair of robot hands to replace them?"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry," Sure would. [He shrugs.] Oh, well. Goodbye."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," Fry, you smelly idiot, I think he's willing to make some kind of deal with the devil with you."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry," He-He-He is? [He turns around.] Great! Wait, what's the catch?"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," No catch. I'll merely pick a robot at random from somewhere in the universe, probably one you've never even met, and then I'll remove his hands and switch them for yours. [Bender rubs his hands with glee.] It's just the sort of guy I am. What do you say?"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely moral to--
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," Fry, if you don't take this offer right now I will lose all respect for you and punch you."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry," Well, alright. You sure I probably won't know him?"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil, Definitely probably not. [A column of rock rises up out of the ground with a piece of paper on top.] Just sign this contract.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender, Wow!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil, And here we go!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender, I got a hundred bucks on Rectal-Exambot!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, Robot Devil? I get your hands? Zam!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," Oh, what an appallingly ironic outcome."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," It's not ironic, it's just coincidental. Now fork over those lady-fingers, Cookie!"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," Y'know, I only put my name on there as a show of good faith for the other robots."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, Stop being such a baby and chop my hands off.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," Oh, very well."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, [impressed] How'd you do that?
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil, They're very good hands.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, At last! At last I have the power to make Leela love me.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," Oh, sorry. That'll wear off in a couple of days."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry," Check it out, everyone. I'm back from hell and I've got the Robot Devil's hands."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Amy, Neat! Let's see a trick.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, Alrighty!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Scruffy, Somebody called the Robot Devil's here to see somebody called Fry.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, Uh-oh.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender, Where'd I go just now?
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," Hello, Fry. [He cackles.] Just dropped by to make sure you're as happy with our little deal as I am. [He cracks and grabs Fry by his jacket.] Give me back my hands! These things are always touching me in places."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry," Yeah, they get around! But I'm afraid we had a deal."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil, Looks like I wasted a bus trip.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry," Yes, you did."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Grumpy Snail, [on TV] Yes. Now you can hear holophonor virtuoso Philip Fry play 900 of these classic themes in your own home on this two-record set. [Behind him Fry walks along a sunset-lit beach playing his holophonor. The hologram flies to the front of the screen revealing it to be his album. The cover features him lying naked on a bed holding the holophonor.] That's over 30 minutes of music for only $14.99.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Zoidberg," Only $14.99 for a two-record set. Two records! Oh, Zoidberg, at last you're becoming a crafty consumer!"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Man, [on phone] Hello?
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Zoidberg, Hello? I'll take eight!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Scruffy, Mr. Hedonismbot to see you.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry," Uh, show him in."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Scruffy," [bowing] Very good, sir."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Hedonismbot," Ah, Fry. Congratulations. Your latest performance was as delectable as dipping my bottom over and over into a bath of the silkiest oils and creams."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry," Thank you, sir. That's exactly what I was going for."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Hedonismbot, You were the sole diversion in what has been a pale and unamusing season. And so I would fain commission you write an opera.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, But I've never written an opera.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Hedonismbot," And I've never heard one. Still, if you can keep me amused through the overture I shall consider it a smashing success."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry," But I wouldn't even know what to write about. Unless... [He turns and looks at Leela, who sits at the table gorging on a buggalo leg dripping with barbecue sauce. He smiles and turns to Hedonismbot.] OK, I'll do it. If I can make it about Leela."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela, Me? Really?
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Hedonismbot," A man writing an opera about a woman? [He laughs.] Oh, sirrah, how deliciously absurd! [He turns around to the door.] I shall see you at the premiere."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela, Is it part of the opera?
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, Leela! [He stands up.] You shouldn't be listening. I don't want you to hear it till it's done.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela, But it's so beautiful.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, So's a peacock but you don't eat it until it's cooked. This has to be perfect. I want you to hear exactly what I hear when I think about you.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela," Oh, Fry. All this time you've had this incredible gift and I never knew. I've been a fool. A fully-justified, prudent fool. [She looks into his eyes and holds his hands then quickly takes hers away.] They're so cold."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil, [shouting; from street] And yet hell is so hot! [He laughs briefly.] Can I have my hands back now?
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, [shouting] No!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil, [shouting; from street] You're not nice!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," Ah, Bender, this is a surprise! For you! Finding me in the refrigerator."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," True, but at least I don't have the hiccups anymore. What up?"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," Oh, well it so happens I'm in the mood to make a deal with you."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender, Forget it! You can't tempt me.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil, [tempting] Really? There's nothing you want?
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," Hm. I forgot you could tempt me with things I want. [He scratches his chin and leans against the worktop.] Well, I suppose I've always wondered what it would be like to be more annoying."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil, Nothing simpler! And all I ask in return is your hands. [He looks at Fry's hands.] To replace these bony hotdogs!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender, Grabby and Squeezy? Never! I love these guys!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil, Well is there anything else you would part with?
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender, No. Nothing. Ain't gonna happen.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender, Yes! With this built-in stadium airhorn I can really annoy people. And all it cost me was my crotch-plate.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," You certainly are a shrewd businessman, Bender. [While Bender isn't looking he tosses the crotch-plate into the bin.] Now find someone and give 'em a good blast!"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender, Yeah! That'll teach the first person I see a lesson.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," Ah, my ridiculously circuitous plan is one-quarter complete!"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela," Well, Fry's opera premiere's tomorrow night. I'm off to find a pair of formal gloves that'll fit over my enormous forearms."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," Pretty annoying, huh, Leela?"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela," [shouting] What? Are you talking? Oh, God! I'm deaf!"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," Oops. I'm so, so sorry, Leela. I just wanted to annoy you."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela," [shouting] What? Oh, this is horrible. I won't be able to hear Fry's opera."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," Ah, how delightfully ironic."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," It's not ironic, it's just mean. Take this!"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil, Ooh! Out of aerosol? Also ironic!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," Oh, yeah? Well bite my shiny metal-- [He points at where his crotch-plate used to be. No ass left to bite.] [shouting] Oh, nooo!"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela," Nobody tell Fry I'm deaf. If he found out I couldn't hear his opera, it'd break his heart."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," OK, deaf-o!"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Hedonismbot," Courtesans and gentle fops, I bid you welcome to my opera. Let us cavort like the Greeks of old. [sexfully] You know the ones I mean."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela," Yay, Fry!"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Zoidberg, I watch TV with that guy!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Holo-Vogel," [singing] Who is this one-eyed female baby Moses,"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,With courage in her female baby smile?,
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Holo-Orphans," [singing] A saviour from the stars,"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Or something stranger still.,
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Holo-Leela," [singing] Or just a lonely, filthy, starving child."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela," Amy, Fry's looking at me. What am I s'posed to be feeling? [Amy opens a box of ""Emotion Flashcards"" and takes out one of the hardhat guy crying.] Ah!"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Holo-Bender," [singing] Leela! Leela, Leela save him!"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"Save Fry, save Fry,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"Godzilla will devour him,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"As for me,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"I must be off,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"To have my doctor check this cough,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,[He coughs.],
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Goodbye!,
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," I don't recall ever fighting Godzilla, but that is so what I would have done."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Amy," One diet double Martini, please."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bartender," And for you, sir?"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Hermes, I'll just have a Shirley Hemple.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Tinny Tim, Extra! Extra! World's greatest opera only half over.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela," Half over? Oh, I'd give anything to hear the rest."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," Anything? [Leela gasps and drops her glass. A man hands the Robot Devil his coat and he hands him a ticket.] Thank you, sir. [The man leaves and the Robot Devil turns to Leela.] Now, as I was saying, anything? Because I can give you new robotic ears!"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela, What? You can give me new ears? Wait. What seemingly reasonable thing do you want in return?
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," Just your hands, my dear."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela," Whatever you said, forget it!"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," Alright then, just one hand."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela," Just ... my left hand? Um, uh--"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Announcer, Please take your seats for act two.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Hedonismbot, But I'm not done vomiting.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela, I can't stand it! [She takes a deep breath.] OK. You can have my hand.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," Wonderful! [He produces another contract.] Just sign here. [Leela signs. Calculon walks by and the Robot Devil stops him.] Calculon, old friend, I'm afraid I need your ears."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Calculon, Well I do owe you for giving me this unholy [melodramatically] acting talent.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela," I can hear! I can hear like a safecracker! Hey, aren't you gonna take my hand?"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil, In good time. You go enjoy the opera.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Holo-Fry," [singing] To win Leela's heart with the holophonors art,"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,I need hands of transcendental quickness.,
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Holo-Robot Devil," [singing] Well I don't see any danger,"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"In gambling with a stranger,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,For my head is of a most amazing thickness.,
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Holo-Robot Devil," [singing] I'm stupid, I'm stupid,"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"I'm stupider than you,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,I'm stupider than you in every way.,
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," Stupider? Pah! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! [He kicks the Holo-Robot Devil actor off the stage. The audience gasps. Fry stops playing and the holo-scene fades, leaving the Holo-Fry actor standing on the stage in his underpants.] Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry," Look, what do you want?"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil, [singing] I want my hands back.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, Never!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"(singing) A deal's a deal,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Even with a dirty dealer.,
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," [singing] Very well,"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Then I'll take what I want from Leela.,
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela, Whoa!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil, [singing] Leela has promised me her hand.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela," [singing] Fry, you do not understand."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela," [singing] I should have revealed I've been deafened by Bender,"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"The shame,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"The shame,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"But I feared you'd stop writing this musical splendour,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"Deception's the curse of my whimsical gender,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"He gave me mechanical ears,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"Effective though just a bit garish,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"In return without shedding a tear,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,I agreed that I'd give him my hand--,
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil, [singing] In marriage!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela, What?
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil, [singing] You'd give me your hand in marriage.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Hermes, [singing] Is this really happening or just being staged?
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Farnsworth, [singing] It can't be real--
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Amy, [singing] Not if Leela is engaged.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela," [singing] That isn't what I meant,"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,That isn't what I signed.,
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil, [singing] You should have checked the wording in the fine... [He makes the contract larger.] Print.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela, [reading] I'll give you my hand...
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela, and  [singing] In marriage.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Bender," [singing] The use of words expressing something other than their literal intention,"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"Now that is ""irony"".",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," [singing] I will marry her now and confine her to hell,"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"How droll,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,How droll!,
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"Where Styx is a river,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"And not just a band,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"Though they'll play our reception if all goes as planned,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"Unless, Fry, you surrender my hands!",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry," [singing] Destiny has cheated me,"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"By forcing me to decide upon,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"The woman that I idolise,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"Or the hands of an automaton,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"Without these hands I can't complete,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"The opera that was captivating her,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"But if I keep them,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"And she marries him,",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Then he probably won't want me dating her.,
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Nixon, Arooo!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Zapp, Bray-vo! Enn-core!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Farnsworth, [singing] I can't believe the devil is so unforgiving.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Zoidberg, [singing] I can't believe everybody's just ad-libbing!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Preacherbot," [singing] By the power vested in me,"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,By the state of New New York--,
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, No! [He pushes the Robot Devil away from Leela.] Stop! Take my hands!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,"(singing) You evil, metal dork!",
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Hedonismbot," Surgery in an opera? How wonderfully decadent and just as I was beginning to lose interest. [He turns to his servants.] Jombey! The chocolate icing! [One of the servants starts spreading chocolate icing over Hedonismbot's stomach. He giggles.] Oh! Oh, my!"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, My hands. My horrible human hands. [He gasps.] And what did you do to my nails?
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Robot Devil," I cleaned them. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's my poker night and I feel lucky. [He giggles.] So it's back to hell for me. Come on, Nixon!"
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Nixon, Huh?
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Hedonismbot," Less reality, more fantasy. Resume the opera."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, But I can't play anymore.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Zoidberg," [shouting] Yes you can! The beauty was in your heart, not your hands. [Fry picks the holophonor up and plays a bad tune. A crude holo-scene forms. A crude Holo-Fry and Holo-Leela walk out of some houses and stare at each other. The audience ""boos"".] The music's bad and you should feel bad."
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Fry, Whoa! Hey!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Tinny Tim, [shouting] Extra! Extra! Greatest opera of all time sucks.
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Zoidberg, I'll take eight!
The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings,Leela," Please don't stop playing, Fry. I wanna hear how it ends."

Bender's Big Score Part 1,Hermes, Sweet bongo of the Congo!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth," In fact, you were fired two years ago! That's when we were shut down by the delivery network."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth (VO)," Yes, I'm afraid the brainless drones who run the network canceled our license."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry, We were canceled?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth," Oh, it's terrible. Just terrible. Well, clear out your desks and move along. Chop-chop."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth, Yes? I see.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Those asinine morons who cancelled us were themselves fired for incompetence."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Staff, Woohoo!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth," And not just fired, but beaten up, too. And pretty badly."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Staff, Woo!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth," In fact, most of them died from their injuries."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Staff, Woo? [Bender laughs]
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth, And then they were ground up into a fine pink powder.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry, Why?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth," Oh, it's got a million and one uses."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth," Ahhh, that soothes the fire."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela, So what does this mean for us and our many fans?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth, It means we're back on the air!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth," Yes, flying on the air in our mighty spaceship!"

Bender's Big Score Part 1,Dr. Cahill," I told you, my name is Dr. Cahill."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Hermes, Figures I'd get mangled while the blonde bimbo's on duty.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Dr. Cahill," I'm a doctor, sir. The mere fact that I'm blonde and have a breathy voice, full sensual lips, and a steaming hot body doesn't make me a bimbo."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Zoidberg, Tell me about it.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Hermes," I think we've all learned a thing or two about sexual stereotypes. While my head's slowly dying 'cause I'm not in a jar yet, you bimbo!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Dr. Cahill," Oh, right. Ditzy-witzy! Lars, got another jar job!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Lars," Oh, sorry, Doctor. I was disinfecting Courtney Love... Oh, hello."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela, What are you looking at? Is it the eye?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Lars," Guilty as charged. It's a nice looking eye, and there's plenty of it."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela, Oh. Do I know you?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Lars, Apparently not. Hi. I'm Lars.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela, Oh. I'm Leela. Nice to meet you.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Lars, Nice to be met.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Hermes," Pick up ladies on your own time, you shiny-headed goat!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Lars," Sir, you're just a little enraged 'cause you're dying. Up and away!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Amy, Lars is so flirting with you.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela, He is so not. He's just being polite.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry," Who does he think he is, being polite to you? You want me to beat him up?"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela, No. Stop being so immature.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry, I'll show her who's immature.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry," ""Charles de Gaulle""? Never heard of you."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,De Gaulle, I freed France from the Nazis and...
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry," Hey, Leela. I'm some French guy."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender," Rock that Frenchman, baby!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,LaBarbara," Oh, my poor little love pirate of the Caribbean!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Hermes," There, there, wife. Everything will be all--"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,LaBarbara," Okay, look, Hermes, we got to think of the boy. He needs a daddy."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Hermes, He has a daddy!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,LaBarbara," No, he got two half-daddies. Will his body be all right?"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Dr. Cahill," Yes, but it may take a few days."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,LaBarbara," No, not soon enough. Come, Dwight, let's find you a handsome new father."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Hermes," LaBarbara, no!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender," It's okay, Hermes. We're all here for you."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! We've got a delivery to the nude beach planet."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Staff, Woohoo!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender," So long, jerk."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Announcer," [voice-over] Futurama is brought to you by ... [The oval zooms back into a corner and is replaced by a can of Torgo's Executive Powder.] ... Torgo's Executive Powder. [cut to cutouts of human heads and shoulders going into a grinder, producing pink powder] Only Torgo's packs the power of five highly paid television executives into every can for maxim odour absorption."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Torgo's Jingle Singer," [singing] When your toilet smells like faeces,"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,from some disgusting species;,
Bender's Big Score Part 1,"make it take a powder,",
Bender's Big Score Part 1,with Torgo's!,
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela, It feels great to be back at the wheel after two long years.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry, That's not the wheel.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela, It's nice out.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry," ""You must be at least this naked""? How much nakeder could you be?"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Zoidberg, Watch and learn.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender," You know, it's funny."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry, What?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender, Your weiner!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth," Well, I'm going in the water to prune up a bit before I strut. Who's with me?"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Amy, I'm in!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela, I'm in.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender," Yeah, I'll go."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry, You guys go ahead. I gotta find the bartender and deliver this box of barstool softener.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry," Here's your package, sir."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bartender, Why are you talking to my penis?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry," Oh, sorry. Sign here."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bartender, Mind if I use your pen?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry," Well, that's not a..."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry, And initial here. [screams again OC]
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry, Thank you for using Planet Express.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela," Hey, Fry, I didn't know you had a tattoo of Bender on your ass."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry, Me neither.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender, You got a tattoo of me? Neat. It's like looking in a smelly mirror.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth, So he's got a little ink. Big whoop.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender," Sweet photons. I don't know if you're waves or particles, but you go down smooth."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar," Sir, would you care to sign our petition?"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender," I support and oppose many things, but not strongly enough to pick up a pen."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar, That's just what the guys who oppose the things you support want you to do.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender, Really? Down with those guys!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fleb, And we'll need your e-mail address.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender," Hmm, they say you shouldn't give out your e-mail address."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar, Right. That's just what those same guys say.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender, Them again?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela, I don't quite understand what this petition's about.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Schlump,  Animals?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Schlump,  And your e-mail address.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela," You won't send me any spam, will you?"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar," Oh, no, no, no, no. Asterisk."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela's Wrist Thingy, You've got spam.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela," Spam, spam, junk."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Amy," Spam. Spam. ""Hi. How are you?"" Oh, that must be from Kiffy."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Amy's computer," Hi, how are you? Low, low prices on erectile dysfunction remedies, sleeping pills, old-person drugs, and antidepressants."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Amy," Antidepressants? Well, I certainly don't want to get depressed."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Amy's computer, Please enter credit card number.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Amy, Is cash okay?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender, Porn. Porn. Free porn. Get rich watching porn? I find that rather hard to believe.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender," Warning, perform virus scan? I'm waiting for porn over here."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender," Oh, yeah, come on, baby."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Zoidberg," Friends, friends! His Majesty Prince Adisaraki O. Zoidberg of Nigeria died."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Amy, When will those antidepressants get here?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Zoidberg," Wait, there's more. Once I wire some good-faith money to an overseas bank account, I'll inherit his kingdom, his canoe, and his plump young wife."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Hermes, You dumb stumps. Don't you realize you're being scammed?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Zoidberg," That is low, Hermes. Just because you don't have a body, you don't want anyone else to be prince of Nigeria. Well, try and stop me from wiring that money."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth," What's going on here? According to my illegal key logging software, you've all been giving out personal information over the Internet. If Hermes were here, he'd fire you all."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Hermes, I am here!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth," Quiet, you. In his absence, I'm calling a mandatory company security seminar. To the mandatorium!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth," Now, it's not hard to spot a phoney Internet come-on. ""Get rich quick x7 q""? Phoney. ""Lose weight with space parasites""? Phoney. What's this? I've won the Spanish National Lottery?"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela," No, it's a scam!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth," My goodness, I'm rich! And to think I didn't even know I had a ticket. I just need to wire some collateral to collect the winnings."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Hermes," Professor, stop! You're giving away personal information!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth, I can afford to give away anything I want. I've won the Spanish National Lottery.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Amy," No, don't!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela, It's a scam!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Hermes, Why won't anybody listen to me?!?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth, And my mother's maiden name and her bank account numbers and ... There! I'm rich. Rich. Rich!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth," That must be my $400 now. Hello. Or should I say, '""Buenos dias""?"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar, Hi. We own your company now.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth, Hwhaa?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender," Welcome, boss."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar, Guess I was wrong. There was a robot stupid enough to download the obedience virus.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender," I sure was. Make a hole, chumps. [Bender gets a red carpet out of his cavity and imitates a trumpet fanfare] Presenting our new masters!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender [carrying a stack of crates bigger than he is]," Where shall I put these auto-dialers, kind master?"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar, Between the password crank and the spamjaculator. Come on! We've got a whole planet to scam. And bring me some more Gummi Fungus!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela, We don't have to stand here and take abuse from a gross nerd.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Amy, Yeah!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry, Yeah!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela, Hi-yah!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar," Now get back to work, you turkeys. Planet Express is still in business. We've got crap loads of quote-unquote merchandise to deliver."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fleb," Ship them out, Your Highness."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Zoidberg," Finally, some respect."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Amy, I feel a little better.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender," Those marvellous scammers sure scammed us, huh?"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela, How can you just sit there kissing the aliens' butt flaps? Don't you realize you are totally under their control?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender," Of course I realize it. Does that mean I can't enjoy it? Boy, were we suckers."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Lars," Greetings, earthlings."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry," Oh, hooray. It's handsome Lars and his fabulous jars."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Lars," Hello, everyone who isn't Leela. And a special hello to everyone else."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Hermes, Shut your lockers and get to class. How's my body doing?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Lars," Oh, I'm afraid it's behind schedule. The museum got tricked into giving all its funding to something called the Scamming Sciences Institute."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender, It's a fake place.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Hermes, No! That body's the cornerstone of my marriage. What's LaBarbara going to do?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Amy, Spluh! She's going to go back to her first husband.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Zoidberg, Barbados Slim? I love that guy.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Hermes, Everybody loves Slim.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Hermes, He's the only man to ever win Olympic gold medals in both limbo and sex.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Lars," Well, maybe I should get going."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry," Yes, I'll show you out."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Amy," No, Leela will show him out."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela," No, Leela will show you out. Me. Leela."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Lars," So your friend, Fry, seems nice. Are you and he dati--?"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela, Nope.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Lars," Good, because I was maybe thinking of asking you out for dinner."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela," Ohhhh. I'll start maybe thinking about saying ""Sure, when?"""
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Lars, Let me maybe give it some thought.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Lars, Tomorrow at 8 00?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela, Okay.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry, It's not fair. I've loved Leela since the day I came to the future. Did I show you the macaroni valentine I made for her?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Amy, Yes.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry," Look at it again. I know she thinks I'm immature, but someday I won't be. And deep down in my heart, I know we'll end up together. It's all there in the macaroni."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela, Lars asked me out!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender," What are you doing, wonderful masters?"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fleb, Sprunjing for information.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar," Oh! There's something here. I can sprunje it. Robot, tear it open!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender," Goody, goody, goody, goody!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Zoidberg, What's that thing on your neck?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar," Checking out my sprunjer, huh?"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Zoidberg, I guess. What does it do?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar, It's a special sense organ our species possesses. It engorges in the presence of... [moans] Information.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Zoidberg, Lucky you. All I have is a gland that gives off foul odors when I'm bored.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender," Hey, look, a safe!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth, That's my safe. I call keep-offsies.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar, No callsies! Open it!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fleb," It's a gold mine. Tax forms, Social Security cards. Combination hair, blood and stool samples!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry, I don't get it. How can you say Lars is more mature than me?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela," Well, for one thing, his chequebook doesn't have the Hulk on it."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar, Who are you?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry, Philip J. Fry.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fleb," Social Security Number 03280810? Stool type, P-negative?"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry, That's right.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar, I've never detected so much information before. I think it may be a Level 87 code.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Schumlp," Level 87? Can it be? I thought it was only a legend, but the sprunjer never lies."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar, It's in his pants!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry, What the hell are you talking about?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar [holding a laser to Farnsworth's head]," Faster, faster!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth, I'm sciencing as fast as I can.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender," What do you say, folks? Hot or not?"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar," You, boogerbot, read the code or I'll shoot this guy."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender, Who the hell is he?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Scruffy," I'm Scruffy, the janitor."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Bender," Hang on, Scruffy! Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, one, one, one, zero, one, zero, zero, zero, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, one, zero, zero, one, one."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,"""God""", Huh?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fleb, A time sphere.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar," Naked brothers, we have sprunjed upon the universal machine language time code. The key to time travel!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela, What's the secret of time travel doing on Fry's ass?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry, It was bound to be somewhere.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Schlump, Beyond this shimmering portal lie all the glories of history.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar, And we can steal them! We just go to the past and take stuff with our superior weapons!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nibbler," Stop, you fools!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Amy, What's going on?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Farnsworth, What is happening?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Leela," Nibbler, you... You can talk?"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nibbler," I can do more than talk. I can pontificate. You must not use the code of codes. With each and every use, you risk tearing the universe asunder."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Schlump, The poodle-monkey may be right. The legend warns that the code is powerful and dangerous.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar," My God. We'd better use it only three or four times. Six, max."
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nibbler, But even a single use could shatter the universe!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar, Got it. Two or three times.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nibbler," I see I have no choice. Nibblonians, attack!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,???, Hey! That tickles.
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nudar, And the pitch!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nibblonian," Mayday, mayday!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Aliens, Hey! Hey! Hey!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nibblonian, Scamper!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Zoidberg, Aawww...
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nibbler," Alas, our kitten-class attack ships were no match for their mighty chairs. The universe is doomed. Doomed!"
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Fry, Can I pull up my pants now?
Bender's Big Score Part 1,Nibbler, Dooooooomed!
Bender's Big Score Part 1,,
Bender's Big Score Part 2,,
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar, Stand back you wing wangs. I'm gonna try out this timesphere with a quick test drive to yesterday.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Farnsworth, Bushwah. You can't go mucking about in the past without creating paradoxes.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nibbler," I'm afraid he can. It's a paradox correcting time code. It all works perfectly. Except when it rips open the universe. Don't do it, I beg you ..."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar," Yesterday please, and make it snappy."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Crew, wha???
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar, Hello.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar-2, Howdy.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, Hey! What the ...?
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Zoidberg," There was one, but now there's two."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar," Nothing gets past you eagle eye. I went back to last night and met the me of that time for a drink. One thing led to another and we ended up at my place, or should I say our place."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Leela, Blech.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar, Oh come on ya bunch of prudes.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Farnsworth," This isn't merely revolting, it's impossible to boot. I know a paradox when I see one."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Farnsworth, Whaaa?
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Farnsworth," Ahh, paradox resolved. Someone get a mop."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Dwight, You're looking well pops.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hermes," How can you look me in the eye 'n eye and say that? I'm nothin' but a brain. A useless, filthy brain."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Barbados Slim (OS), You forgot lice infested.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hermes," I didn't forget it, I just chose not to .... [gasps] Barbados Slim! What are you doin' here? IS there somethin' goin' on between you two?"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,LaBarbara," Oh no no no no, we jus' ah happened to run into each other shortly after your accident."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Slim, And every night since then.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,LaBarbara, You're so crazy.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hermes," Woman! No! Ohh, who am I kiddin'? Without my body, I'm a nobody."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,LaBarbara, I'm sorry Hermes. But look at Barbados. You can't argue with those luscious pecks.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hermes, No I can't. But I can ask him to stop wiggling them in my face.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Slim, I'm not wiggling them. They do that by themselves.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar, I think I'll go back in time and steal the Liberty Bell before it cracked. Or is the crack the valuable part?
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Farnsworth, I don't know you naked crook.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fleb," [reading from ""A Brief History of Time Travel""] We have a problem Nudar. It's a one way time code. It can take us to the past, but it can't bring us back to the present."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Oh oh oh oh oh oh! Masters, if I might, let me do the stealing. I'll go to the past and snatch everything I can get my greasy mitts on. Then, as a robot, I could just wait it out for a few centuries in the limestone cavern beneath this building. Oh, it'll be ever so much fun."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar," Hey, that's perfect. We sit back and let dum dum here do the stealing."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, Dum dum away. Zero zero one one ....
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Leela, The Mona Lisa!
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Sorry, it's not quite finished."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Schlump,  Da Vinci give you any trouble?
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, Let's just say he may not make it to The Last Supper. Hahahahahaha.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Farnsworth, Preposterous twaddlecock. Time travel is impossible.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fry," But Professor, you time traveled yourself, remember, when we went back to Roswell?"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Farnsworth," That proves nothing. And furthermore, you'd think I'd remember a thing like that. Plus, who are you anyway?"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Man, this is fun on a bun. Here I go again."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nibbler, Oh no you don't.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Scarab, four arm, bird, bird, bird!"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Boo! Hahahaha. Naw, it's just me, Bender."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Farnsworth," I must tell you Hedonismbot, I hate to sell my doomsday devices to a private collector. But with my business stolen I have to make ends meet. You will be careful?"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hedonismbot," I shan't touch them till I've had Jambi lock the absinthe and ether away. Ohhhh, what does this one do?"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Farnsworth," Uh, that one kills everything everywhere."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hedonismbot, How delightful. And this one?
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Farnsworth, Sir! The sphereoboom is not for sale.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Farnsworth, It's my sentimental favorite.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hedonismbot," No need to explain. I too have known unconventional love. Perhaps you and I, and Jambi, could get together and compare notes sometime, eh?"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,MC, ... resulting in peace between east and west coat rappers ...
Bender's Big Score Part 2,MC, Good god!
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," I accept this Nobel peace prize not just for myself, but for crime robots everywhere. Skål!"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Not so neutral now, are you Sweden?"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Leela, Be honest with me. Does my eye look monstery? I don't want to look monstery for my date with Lars.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hermes," At least a monster has a body. What I wouldn't give for Wolfman's torso, or any of the groovy ghoulies."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Leela [looking at Lars' business card]," Ohh, I think I'll wear that slutty dress I've been saving for Easter."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fry [taking the card from Leela], I'd like to punch Lars right in his ruggedly good looking face!
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar," Like all rich people, we're gonna need weapons to shoot poor people."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Schlump, In self defense?
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar," Yes, that too. Bender, go steal the doomsday device chained to the professor's wrist."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Never! Ha ha, I'm kidding. You guys know I have to do whatever you say."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar," Here, swap this for the real one."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, Ahhh! The old switcheroo.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar," Yes, but don't wake him. You'll need jeweler's tools and foot cup silencers."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Hey, I don't tell you how to tell me what to do, so don't tell me how to do what you tell me to do. Bender knows when to use finesse."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, Here ya go.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar," Put it in the safe, clanky."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Zoidberg [OC], Owww!
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, Wheeeeeeee.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Zoidberg [voice over], It's the damdest thing ...
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Zoidberg, ... there I was in the dumpster enjoying a moldy fudgesicle when suddenly your hand flies over and slaps me in the tokhes.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Farnsworth," Yes, well, these things happen. Fortunately the sphereoboom is still safe."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Farnsworth, Scammed? Me!? Sweetheart?!? Ohh!
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hermes," You do a nice hand job, Zoidberg. Tell me, If I could find an undamaged body, could you recapitate me?"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Zoidberg," Hermes, I'm a surgeon. When I see two body parts I sew them together and see what happens."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hermes, Hmmm.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hermes, All I'm askin' is for you to go back in time to when I still had my body and bring it back for me.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, What do I do with your old head?
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hermes, I don't care in the slightest.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, [brandishing bloody hack saw] Can do!
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hermes," Come on, mon!"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Zoidberg," [pouring some liquid from Hermes' jar into the bowl] Hermes, please. You can't hurry a delicate operation like this."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hermes, Ohh! ... Ug! ... Argh! ... Ahhhhhh. [looking down] What are those?
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hermes, You incompetent crab!
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Zoidberg," I thought you were happy, your tail is wagging."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hermes, Grrrrrr....
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Farnsworth," I believe this paradoicality equation to be unsolvable, ergo time travel is impossible. But I can't quite prove it, Bubblegum. Perhaps you and your razzle dazzle Globetrotter calculus could ..."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bubblegum," [interrupting] Looks pretty damn solvable to me, Farnsy. Sweet Clyde, use variation of parameter and expand the Wronskian."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Farnsworth," Shizz, baby. So paradox free time travel is possible after all."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bubblegum, Right on. But dig this multiplicand here.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Farnsworth, The doom field? That must be what corrects the paradoxes.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Curly Joe," When that momma rises exponentially, it could rupture the very fabric of causality."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nibbler, That's what I've been trying to tell you.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Farnsworth," Hermes, you got your body back. Hurrah!"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hermes," Yes, but not the original. Bender went back in time and picked up a copy."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bubblegum," A copy! Funky cold medina. According to this equation, a time travel duplicate results in a complex denominator in the causality ratio."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Sweet Clyde, Oh Snap! Bet you know what that means.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hermes," I can guess. Actually, I can't guess."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bubblegum," Prof, you got a doom meter in this lab."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Farnsworth," [looking at doom meter showing nearly 1000 millidooms] Good Lord, Bubblegum. The duplicate body is emitting doom at ten times the back ground level."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bubblegum, I thought as much. A duplicate body is always doomed. It's just a matter of time.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hermes, I don't care. I just need it long enough to bird dog in an win LaBarbara back.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bubblegum, Best bird dog fast my brother.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Hermes, That the way I bird dog best.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Lars," Drink, quick. I can't balance it much longer."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Leela, Wait .. I .. [Leela drinks]
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Lars, Yes!
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Leela, This is so much fun Lars. Most men are intimidated by the fact that I could kill them with the flick of my wrist.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Lars," Well not me. 'Cause if you do, you'll be stuck with the check."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Elzar," [with a spice weasel] Folks, care for a little fresh ground executive?"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Leela, Please.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Elzar, Bam!
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Elzar," Don't get excited kids, this thing's got heart shaped nostrils. Want to see it make a star?"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Leela and Lars, No!
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Here's your Gutenberg Bible master. Plus the Colonel's secret recipe  Chicken, Grease, Salt."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fleb," Well, that does it. We've got every valuable object in history."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fry, Owww!
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar, Hmm. Now that I'm rich I suddenly care if the universe gets destroyed. We can't use that dangerous time code again. Blank it from the robot's memory.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, Ahhhhh.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar, [looking at Fry] I'll vaporize this guy so his ass doesn't fall into the wrong hands.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fry, Why don't you just remove my tattoo?
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar, Nice try. But you might have memorized it.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fry, No I mighn't. I can't even remember my mother's maiden name.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar, It's Gleisner.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fry, [running] Stupid naked aliens. Stupid Lars. I hate the future.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fry, Hmmmm!
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bubblegum," Man, that cube root was a real buzzer beater, Clyde."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fry, Zero. One. One. One. Zero. Zero. One. One!
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Schlump, Blast him.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, Ha ha! You missed! Oh great master.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fry, Hello 2000. I'm home.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Voice," (OC) Happy New Year, naked weirdo!"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fry, Happy new year.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar," Well, we'll never know where the ass guy went, and since we can't kill him, I say live and let live."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Aww, that's sweet boss. Fry'll be nice and cozy back in the year 2000."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar, What?! How do you know he went to the year 2000?
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, That's where he always goes.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar, Hmm. Better play it safe. Go there a little earlier and wait for him. You know what to do.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," You want me to concludify him, like some sort of dispatcherator?"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Nudar, Yes. And don't forget to terminate him.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, Got it. Preparing to terminate Philip Fry!
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Schlump, What's with the doofy sun glasses?
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, It's really bright in the past. [Recites the time code]
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Ok, Fry. Come ta poppa. ... Man I'm bored. [spots beer] Ohhh!"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,[Bender drinks the 5 cans left in the 6 pack from SP3000],
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Hey, there you are! ... Oh, wait, that's Fry before he goes to the future. I'm waiting for the one who comes back from the future. Geesh this is confusing, and I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing. Offf. That cheap beer really goes right through you. For the first time ever, I gotta use the bathroom, but if I leave, I might miss Fry. Ohhhh unless ...."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,[19 second earlier],
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender-2, ... and I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing. Huh! Ah! Wha?
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Hi, I'm you from 19 seconds in the future. Stay here and wait for Fry while I go to the bathroom."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender-2, Ok Boss. After I kill Fry you're next.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, What?
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender-2, Nothing.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender-2, What the? Who are you?
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender-3, I'm Bender from way at the end. I came back to put this rub-on time code on Fry's ass.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender-2," So what are you now, a butler? Spot of tea please, jerkwad!"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender-3," It's called class, you yokel. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a buttocks to tattoo."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fry, Hello 2000. I'm home.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Voice," (OC) Happy New Year, naked weirdo!"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fry, Happy new year.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender-2," Hasta la vista, meatbag!"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fry," Bender? What are you doing? It's me, your best friend."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender-2, Must obey orders. Ohhhhh. Mustn't kill friend!! Ohhhhhh!!! Badly want to urinate!!!!!
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fry, What's happening? Are you urinating?
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender-2," [monotone] Entering auto destruct sequence. [normal] Awww crap, I hate auto destruct sequence! [monotone] Explosion in seven, six, ..."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fry, It'll be a cold day in hell my friend.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender-2," [monotone] five .. [normal] Hey, I'm supposed to be the one saying cool things!"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Hey ... so the game of cat and mouse begins, huh? Let us match wits. .... Ohhhh, how am I supposed to find him? All those times he blabbed on and on about his life in the twentieth century. If only I'd paid the slightest bit of attention. Oh well, guess I'd better go kill myself."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Cryogenicist (from Jurassic Bark)," Hello, bartender? I have thought it over, and far from being a fat pig, you are very nice and I would like another drink ..."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Take a barf buddy. Ok suicide booth, give me your best shot. Electrocution please, side order of poison. [taps foot] Helloooo? Kill me you stupid machine. ... What the ... local calls fifty cents? It's a street corner telephone parlor! Oh what kind of horrible suicide free time is this? Wait a minute, maybe this handy encyclopedia of humans will help me track Fry down."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," One of these Frys must be Fry. Look out Philip Fry, 'cause I got a little present for you."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fat Man, My name is Phillip Fry. Where's my present.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, Hang on a second Fry. I don't remember you being that ugly.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fat Man," Oh no, I've always been this ugly."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Huh. Let me see your ass. [He looks at the fat man's buttocks.] No tattoo. Okay, you can go."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Fat Man, Farewell sir.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Say your prayers, Fry."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Michelle, This isn't Fry. I kicked Fry out two hours ago. This is my new boyfriend ... uhhh ...
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Constantine, Constantine.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Michelle, Really? That's a dumb name. Ewwww.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Hmmm, could be a trick. Let me see your ass, Constantine. [He looks at Constantine's buttocks.] Ohh, nice, now I see why she left Fry."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Okay, you're still clean. I mean metaphorically."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," He must have left the city. Man, this could take all day."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Phil," The returns are looking good, Mr. Gore."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Al Gore," Thanks, Phil. Here's to four years of clean air, clean government, and amazing new technologies such as ..."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Al Gore, ... ROBOT!
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, [racking pump on gun] Philip Fry?

Bender's Big Score Part 2,Transition Announcer, Twelve years passed. Then ...
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Transition Announcer, ... this.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, Philip J. Fry?
Bender's Big Score Part 2,"Yancy Fry, Jr."," Phil, some kind of trash can here to see you. He's coming."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Philip J. Fry II, Are you made of Tinkertoy?
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, Hmmm. It's been twelve years. Maybe I'm getting taller.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Philip J. Fry II, You're not getting smarter.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Listen, pipsqueak, are you Philip J. Fry or not? 'Cause if you are, I'm here to kill you."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Philip J. Fry II, I'd like to see you try.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Philip J. Fry II, [screams] You want Uncle Phil. He went to the North Pole on a fishing boat.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, Ahhhh! The North Pole? I was just there.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," One ticket to the North Pole, please, broom closet class. [Gasps as a bearded figure descends a boarding ramp from a ship] Fry? If only I could be sure. [The figure's pants sag, revealing the Bender tattoo] It is him, I'd recognize me, and hence him, anywhere."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender, Follow that guy. There's an extra hundred in it for you if you follow him so close that you run him over.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Al Gore, (cab driver) Yes sir.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Al Gore, Dang. That hundred dollars could have bought me one gallon of gas.
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Ohhh! I lost him. People will call me a failure. [sees Fry in a second floor window] Others however will call me the world's sexiest killing machine who's fun at parties. Fry, old buddy, it's me, Bender."
Bender's Big Score Part 2,Bender," Wooo! I totally killed him. [laughs then cries] Oh god, what have I done?"
Bender's Big Score Part 2,,
Bender's Big Score Part 3,,
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender, Preparing to terminate Philip Fry.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Schlump, What's with the doofy sun glasses?
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender, It's really bright in the past.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender, [crying] Mission accomplished.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Schlump, Fry is dead?
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender, No other robot could have done it. It took twelve years of tireless stalking but I hunted down and killed my best friend. [cries] I'm the greatest.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Head cleaner, Time code and obedience virus erased.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender, Huh?
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Head cleaner," Also, fifty terabytes of porn."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender, Hey!
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Nudar," You've got no porn, no code, and you're ugly! Let's dance!"
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Leela, Now it's true we'll all miss Fry.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Zoidberg, He was the only one of you who never struck me.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Leela, And we'll never see if boyish smile and hair horn again. But I bet he went back to his own time. I'm sure he was very happy and lived to a ripe old age.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender, He wasn't and he didn't!
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender," Struggling alone again incredible odds, I, Bender, managed to kill him. [cries] I blew him to mush like a midget in a microwave. [cries]"
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Amy," Awww, don't blame yourself, Bender."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender," I don't blame myself, I blame all of you."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Amy, Us?! How can you possibly blame us?
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender," It ain't easy. It just proves how great I am. [breaks down and cries] Ohhh, Fry, I'd give anything to unmurder you!"
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry, Did someone call me?
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender, No. [gasps] Fry? [runs to Fry] But ... I killed you in 2012. Unless ...
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry, Ooph!
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender," Nope, he's not a zombie."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Lars, Welcome back Fry.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry," [sarcastic] Thank you, Lars."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Lars," [to Leela] I .. ah ... I .. I'll see you later, honey."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Farnsworth," So tell us Fry. If Bender killed you centuries ago, how in Satan's glorious name did you return?"
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry," Ohh, it's an astonishing tale of incredibleness. It all began when I went back in time."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Farnsworth, Duhhh.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry," Hey, Mr. Panucci, I'm back from that delivery to the cryogenic lab."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Panucci, Great. I'll put you on the cover of Big Whoop magazine!
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry," Mmmm, I'm starving. Can I have a slice?"
Bender's Big Score Part 3,[Panucci take a slice of pizza from the garbage and puts it on the counter],
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Panucci, Help yourself. Cash up front.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,[Fry pull out his wallet that only had future money in it],
Bender's Big Score Part 3,H.G. Blob (on bill), This note is legal tender.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry," (VO) Unfortunately, I had no money from that era. But that's when it hit me - I knew where to find free pizza."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry," [groans] Ohh, ice cold."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry, (VO) That's when it hit me again ...
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry, But an hour ago this pizza's still luke warm. [unzips pants and reads time code off his ass] Zero zero one one zero ...
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender-2," (OC) [monotone] Explosion in seven, six ..."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,[In background Fry-2 kicks Bender into the cryotube],
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2, It'll be a cold day in hell my friend.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender-2," [monotone] five .. [normal] Hey, I'm supposed to be the one saying cool things!"
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry," Nice kick, me."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2, Thanks. What are you doing here?
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry," One hour from now, I travel back in time for free pizza."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2, But Nibbler said not to use the time code.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry," Fine, Mr. Responsible, don't use the code. Mmmmm. That pizza sure was good."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2, You pig.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry, Whatever.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry, (VO) That's when it hit me yet a third time ...
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry," [slaps himself on the forehead] You idiot, frozen me's still got a wallet full of old timey money."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,"[Fry goes to tube #40, opens the door, and reaches around frozen Fry, touching his ass on the tattoo.]",
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry," Yuck, I touched my own butt."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,[Fry slips on the overturned chair and falls into the cryotube],
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry, So I unfroze ten minutes ago and I walked over here and then it was now and then I don't know what happened.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender," Well, I'm glad you're alive, but I don't want people to say I'm incompetent so I better kill you again. Hold still."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Farnsworth, Bender! Stop killing for a minute. The Fry you murdered was doomed anyway. See?
Bender's Big Score Part 3,[Fansworth switches on a holo projector in his belt buckle which shows the equations from his lab backboard.],
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender, What'd ya got there? Numbers?
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Farnsworth," When the time code duplicates a living thing, the copy is always doomed. And that includes flabby Jamaican potbellies."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Hermes, Kiss my front butt.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry, So my copy lives twelve years before Bender murdered him?
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender, Brutally murdered.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry, I wonder what his life was like?
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Scruffy, I guess we'll never know.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Zoidberg, Or will we?
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Scruffy, Nope.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Transition Announcer," They won't know, but you will. Lucky you."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2," Oh hey Mr. Panucci, I'm back from the delivery to the cryogenic lab."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Panucci, I know. I read about it in Big Whoop magazine.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2, So ... uh ... my girlfriend kicked me out. Can I rent the upstairs storage room?
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Panucci," The upstairs storage? [Laughs] I like you kid. Your lousy life makes me feel good about myself. The room's yours. Here, take some rat spray for the meat ball hamper."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Hermes," Happy day, mon! It's good to have you back."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Nibbler," Indeed, but the scammers will soon sprunje the code again. We must remove the time tattoo at once, and as painlessly as possible."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Lars," Hurry, they're coming."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Nibbler," There, the code is gone. I saved the space-time continuum and forty percent of your rectum."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bubblegum, That's all you need.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Nudar, I sprunje code.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Nibbler," Too late, Nudar. I've wiped Fry's butt clean."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Nudar, [sniffing] We'll see about that.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fleb, Nothing boss. We sprunjed his ass inside and out.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Schlump, The only information we found was a hair shaped like the number six.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Nudar," [taking hair] Give me that. [eats hair] mmm. Nine. Alright, let him go, I guess the time code really is gone."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry," Thank god. The present may stink, but at least now we can look forward to a better yesterday."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2," I'm sorry Leela, I can't keep living in the past, by which I mean the future. I'll always love you, but I've got to move on and find my life's purpose."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,TV Anchorman, ... and that how Bundles the monkey finally found a friend.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2, I miss Morbo.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,TV Anchorman," And finally tonight on the late, cute animal news, a story that will really tug your heartstrings, way more than bundles, the doll-raping monkey. It's the tale of lonely Leelu, the little orphan narwhal."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2, Awww.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Dr. Schlovinowitz," (on TV) Leelu is a rare, toothed female narwhal who got disoriented and washed up in Atlantic City, as we all do from time to time. But without a mother, she's lost the will to eat. [offering bottle to Leelu] Come on, take a sip."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2, I know how to make things eat. Maybe this is my purpose in life.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry," Hi, I'd like to apply for a job working with Leelu."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Dr. Schlovinowitz," Question number one, do you have any experience working with marine mammals?"
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2," No, but I think they're pretty neat."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Dr. Schlovinowitz," That answers question number two. Question number three, do you know where the door is or would you prefer to be kicked out?"
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2, I don't know. I guess kicked out.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2," Hiya girl. My name's Fry, and I think you're a cutie 'cause I like things that have only one thing instead of two things."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Dr. Schlovinowitz," Holy mackerel, she's eating whole mackerel. I don't know what your secret is but if you'll work for minimum wage you can start tomorrow."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2," If I work of less than minimum, can I start today?"
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Dr. Schlovinowitz, I don't see why not.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Morbo," (on TV) In business news, the weak and gullible inhabitants of Earth were plunged into economic depression today as the scammer aliens finished stealing every item of value, including ownership of this station."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Linda, (on TV) [laughs]
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Nudar, Tough times earth chumps. We're repossessing your TV. Seems you can't afford it now that you're unemployed.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Zoidberg, We're not unemplo --
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Lars, I love the hard museum at night. It's where I come to be alone.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Heads, Hi Lars.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,De Gaulle," Ah, Lars and la belle Leela. I trust you brought some haute cuisine for an old Frenchman."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Lars," You're favorite General, Torgo's Executive Powder."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,De Gaulle, Mmmm. Magnifique.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Lars," Come on Leela, let me show you the hall of screaming skulls."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Leela, It's so romantic. [turns away from Lars and cries]
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Lars, What's wrong? Is the screaming depressing you?
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Leela, It's just ... my life is changing so fast. I don't know who I am anymore.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Lars, I know who you are. You're the woman I've been waiting for all my life.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,[Lars and Leela kiss.],
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Leela, Let's go to my place.

Bender's Big Score Part 3,Leela, There aren't any Pandas in New New York.

Bender's Big Score Part 3,Zoidberg, [raising claw an instant later] Maid of honor! Ohhh.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry," [quietly] I could make you happy too, if only you'd give me a chance."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Dr. Schlovinowitz," You've done a wonderful job, Fry. When you first started, I thought she'd be dead within a narweek, which is six days I believe."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2," Nah. Leelu's a champ. She just needed someone to show her how to eat. [Fry-2 tosses a fish into his mouth, and another into Leelu's mouth]"
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Dr. Schlovinowitz, Now that the kind of whale behavioral science they don't teach you in whale behavioral science class.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry," So what's up, Dr. Schlovinowitz?"
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Dr. Schlovinowitz," [sighs] This is a little hard for me to say Fry. You see, it's ... it's time we released Leelu back into the wild."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,[Fry-2 coughs up a fish skeleton],
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Dr. Schlovinowitz, I'm sorry. The decision is final. Plus we need the tank for the Loch Ness monster.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2, But that turned out to be a log with a Halloween mask stapled to it.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Dr. Schlovinowitz," Yes, well, it still draws a crowd."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2," [crying] I can't let this happen, she'll never be happy without me."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Elzar, I know you're broke and homeless but you still want a swank wedding reception so I whipped you up some real nice budge appetizers.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Lars, [tasting one] Mmmm. I can keep these down.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Elzar," Okay! That's a big ""yes"" on the crud puffs. Try the shlimp cocktail."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry, There must be some way I can stop this wedding. What if I steal the wedding ring?
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender, Already taken care of. [Bender displays a diamond ring on his finger]
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry, You think that'll be enough to stop the ceremony.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender," Nope. I pulled the old switcheroo, so they won't even know the difference. Wait a minute, I think the copy I made cost more than this."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry, Cheap lousy Lars.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender," [examining the ring through a jeweler's loupe] Actually this is extremely nice, but I really went all out on the copy. It was sorta my gift to them."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry, I can't let this happen. She'll never be happy without me.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2," It's not fair, we need each other."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Panucci," Fry, you dumb sack, I don't care about your problems at all! [coughs]"
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2, You need your blanket Mr. Panucci.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Panucci," I don't even want to be here. I only came 'cause you wheeled me. But if that narwal means so much to you, you gotta do something."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2, I know. But I can't just go chasing after her. That'd be nuts.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Panucci," Ah, Sometimes you gotta be a little nuts. Let me introduce you to my cousin. He owns a small freighter. That's him, right behind us."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2," [to Panucci] Maybe you're right. [to Panucci's cousin] Sir, I'd like to engage your ship for a trans-Arctic voyage to capture a Narwhal and bring it back to my room."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Panucci," The mans is nuts, Leroy."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Leroy," Professional whale keeper, eh? I've carried your type before and we don't get along. Oh, I agree with your values and your goals and your methods, but somehow we just never click on a personal level."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2, I'm not a professional anymore. Just a narwal loving private citizen.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Leroy, Then I'm you man. We'll take on three barrels of fresh sausage and sail at dawn.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Terry, [dramatically] Welcome to the wedding.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry, [to Bender] It's a fool proof plan. They can't sign the wedding license if I give them a pen with no ink. [laughs and exchanges pens]
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender," Yeah, once they try to sign that license, all hell will break look. [rolls eyes up, muttering] Oy vey."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,LaBarbara," Go on now, mon, don' cha' know nothin' about zippin' up a woman's frock?"

Bender's Big Score Part 3,Hermes," Get your clumsy, muscular hands off my woman, Barbados."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,LaBarbara, Hermes! Your body!
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Slim, I always said you were a little backward.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Hermes," Well, I always said you were a little forward ... with my wife."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bystanders, ohhh!
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Hermes, [zips up LaBarbara frock] Consider yourself bird dogged.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,LaBarbara," That's my man. Take a boat, Barbados."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bubblegum," Brother, you gots to tell that sweet thing your time duplicate body is doomed."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Hermes," Tomorrow morning. After the ""festivities""."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bubblegum," [nudging Hermes and spinning a basketball on his finger] Yow, baby!"

Bender's Big Score Part 3,Father Changstein-el-Gamahl," Dearly liked, we are gathered here before one or more gods, or fewer, to joining this couple in pretty good matrimony. If anyone objects to this union, let them speak now or forever hold their piece, or do something else."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Leroy," It's been two years, Fry. We've caught a hundred and eight narwhals and set them all free again."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2, None of them were Leelu.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Inuit #1, But all of them were edible.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Inuit #2, [pointing] Can we at least eat that one? I'm sick of sausage.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2," [looking through binoculars, gasps] I'd know that modified extended tooth anywhere. To the boats!"
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2," Leelu! Leelu! It's me, Fry."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Fry-2," [hugging Leelu] Oh, I've missed you too, Leelu. But we'll never be apart again because we care too much for each other. Fire!"
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Father Changstein-el-Gamahl," Now, if the couple will sign the wedding license."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Farnsworth, I warned him. I warned him a time paradox duplicate is always doomed.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Lars, [surprised] What?
Bender's Big Score Part 3,LaBarbara," Oh, no, my man! He's essentially dead again."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Dr. Cahill, Relax ma'am. Your husband's original body will be repaired within one week.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,LaBarbara, Nah uh uh. Not soon enough. Boy needs a daddy.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Slim," Cruel runnings, mon. [laughs]"
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Dr. Cahill," Woopsy-doopsy, poopsy."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Hermes," Well, let's get on with it. Don't let my doomed body and my doomed marriage stand in the way of your happiness."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Lars," No, it's not right. We don't want our happy day tainted by misfortune and tragedy, do we?"
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Leela, I'm OK with it.
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Lars," No, it's not right. The wedding is off."
Bender's Big Score Part 3,Bender, Oh my goodness! [starts stealing the wedding gifts]

Bender's Big Score Part 4,Bender," I was working the long con all along. While sawing off the professor's hand with an extremely dull saw, I had some time to think. So I asked myself, ""Who could use a doomsday device more? The scammers or me, Bender?"". After several minutes of sawing, I knew the answer. Me, Bender. So I retrieved the dummy satchel ..."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Bender," (VO) ... and as soon as I was out of the scammers' control, I pulled the old switcheroo."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Bender, And that's how I saved Earth and am the greatest!
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Nixon," Bender the robot, I'm proud to present you Earth's highest award for swindling. The Dirty Double-Cross."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Bender, I'll aways treasure it and immediately hock it.
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Lars," There, your body's good as new. Just pop in an executive suppository every few..."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry, What is it?
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Leela, Nothing.
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry," It's supposed to be a celebration, Leela. I mean, come on. Whimmy-wham-wham-whazle!"
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Leela, I can't help it. I was gonna be married. I was so happy.
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry," Well, maybe you'll meet someone else someday."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Leela," No, you don't understand. Lars is the only man I'll ever love. I know it in my heart."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry, You remember when we first met?
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Leela," Uh-huh. lt was right there in the cryogenic lab, eight years ago today."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry, Meet me there in five minutes. It's important.
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry-2," Why are you so sad, Leelu?"
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry-2," Him again? [sudden realization strikes] Wait a second, are you two..."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry-2," Atanarjuat, Fufu, come here! We have to set Leelu free."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Inuit #2, Dang. I never should have quit my job at the casino.
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry-2," Me, neither. But she needs what'll make her happy, not what'll make me happy."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry-2," Goodbye, Leelu."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Lars," I don't much know about frozen heads, but, of course, if it's Mahatma Gandhi, I'll... Leela?"
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Leela, Lars?
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Lars," I... I really have to go, I..."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Leela," Fry, was this an idiotic trick to get Lars and me back together?"
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry," Quite idiotic. But you don't need to be an idiot to see that you two belong together. And, Leela,I want what'll make you happy, not what'll make me happy."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Lars," I'm sorry, I really am, but Leela and I just can't be married."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry," Why not? You obviously love each other. What are you, cousins?"
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Lars," Fry, you deserve to know the truth. It's because..."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Nudar, Nobody move!
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Leela, Nudar! How did you survive the doom blast?
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Nudar," My doom-proof platinum vest absorbed most of the radiation. In retrospect, I wish I'd been wearing doom-proof pants, but you know us nudists. Now give me the time code!"
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry, I don't have it! Nibbler heat-blasted it off my butt.
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Nudar, Not you.
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Nudar, You!
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Leela, Lars? He doesn't have it. He never had it. Fry had it!
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry, But Nibbler heat-blasted it off my butt! I want to stress that part!
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Nudar, My throbbing sprunjer says otherwise. Now where is it?
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Lars, I'm not afraid of you or your expensive gun! Go ahead and shoot!
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Nudar," Oh, yeah? Then what if I kill the woman you love?"
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Leela," Don't you understand, numb-neck? He doesn't love me!"
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Lars, [crying] I've... always loved you. Don't hurt her. I'll give you the code.
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Nudar, What the...
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Bender-2," [monotone] Four, three, two, [normal voice] one, Boom! [Nothing happens. Bender-2 laughs] Woah!"
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Leela," Lars, no!"
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry-2, [Looking at a picture of Leelu] It's enough just to know you're happy.
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry-2," [Looking at a picture of Leela and crying] You, too. It's enough to know you're happy with Lars."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Bender," Fry, old buddy! It's me! Bender! [Bender fires his gun]"
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry-2, My hair!
Bender's Big Score Part 4,[Coughs],
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry-2, My larynx!
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Lars, I'm Lars?  I'm Lars!
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry," Wait for me, Leela! I'll be there in a thousand years."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Lars," [On a screen] So I got a job at the Head Museum and waited for the wonderful day when Leela would arrive. Everything was perfect until Hermes exploded at our wedding. That's when I learned that, as a time paradox duplicate, I, too, was doomed. I couldn't put Leela through that. So I called it off. I'm sorry, Leela."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Leela, [sad] I understand.
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Crazy Guy, That concludes another Silly Willy Wideo Will!
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry," He was a good man, Leela."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Leela, Yeah... you were.
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Farnsworth," Well, I guess that wraps everything up in a nice, paradox-free bow."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Bubblegum," Not quite, my wrinkly brother."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Nibbler," Right on! In order for any of this to make any sense at all, someone must make one final trip back in time to put the code on Fry's ass in the first place!"
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Bender," Sounds like a job for me, Bender."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Bender," Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero..."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Bender, Mission accomplished!
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Fry, You put the time code on my ass?
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Bender," Someone's ass. Oh, and guess what? I met all these really cool guys with treasure down in the limestone cavern, so I invited them to stick around instead of coming up when they were logically supposed to."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Nibbler, No! No! Everyone out of the universe! Quick!
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Bender, What's the worst that can happen?
Bender's Big Score Part 4,Bender," Well, we're boned."
Bender's Big Score Part 4,,
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,,
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Narrator, Previously on Futurama.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Morbo, It has now been one month since space ripped open like flimsy human skin. Terrified earthlings are beginning to grow exhausted.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Hermes," Professor, sprinkle us with wisdom from your mighty brain. How scared should we be?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Professor, Somewhere between not at all and entirely.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Zoidberg," I call entirely. [He springs up, flipping the table upside down and knocking food and beverages all over the four on the couch. He whoops and scuttles his way out of the room.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Morbo," Scientists believe the rip is a gateway to another universe, but do not know what mysteries lie beyond. However, in this reporter's opinion gruesome death awaits us all!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Linda," And now with sports, here's Sportsbot 5000."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Sportsbot 5000, All sports cancelled.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Professor," To better understand the anomaly, I will now focus its radiation on a giant medium-sized ant to see what happens."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Giant medium-sized ant, What's going on here? I was told there would be sugar syrup.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Professor," Quiet, you. [He pulls a switch down. A giant magnifying glass focuses a beam of light from the anomaly onto Farnsworth's head. His forehead to the tip of his upper lip is blasted by fire. Farnsworth screams and Leela sighs and flips the switch to ""off."" She pulls out a fire extinguisher and puts out the Professor's head.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry," Oh, hey, everyone, this is Colleen."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,ALL, Hello!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Amy, I like your shoes.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bender (Laughing), This is awkward. Introducing your new girlfriend to Chesty McNag-nag.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Leela," Oh, don't mind him. I'II turn him off."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bender," Hey, you can't (voice slowing)turn me off..."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Leela, Hi. I'm Leela.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Colleen," Hi, Leela, hi, everyone. Sorry I've been taking up so much of Fry's time. He's just so interesting. Have you seen how much cotton candy he can eat?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Professor," Oh, my, yes. 5.1 pounds. That's why his blood is so good on pancakes. [He picks up a stack of pancakes with Fry's blood acting as a syrup.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry," Well, got to skedoodle-oodle. We're taking a cuddle-cab to Hug-a-Bunny Village. [The two kiss, then exit the room.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Zoidberg, This lovey-dovey stuff is making me vomit from my saltwater and freshwater stomachs.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Leela, It is pretty sickening.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Zoidberg," No, the double-vomit is a sign of joy. Fry told me how he and Colleen first met."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Zoidberg," So, how did you and Colleen first meet?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry, Well...
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry, Something about seeing it on the Jumbotron makes it so much more real.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Colleen, It's so scary. What are you supposed to do when the whole universe is coming to an end?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry," I have a thought. [Cut to the two of them in bed, both smiling. Fry blows a bubble with his gum and it pops around his mouth.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bender," This is gonna be juicy. What? Oh, man!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Amy," Speaking of sappy love... Want to tell them, Kiffy?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Kif," Yes, Amy and I have a big announcement. I... That is, we... Oh, I'm just so excited."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Amy, Kif has asked me to be his Fonfon Ru. [She hugs Kif.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Zoidberg, Mazel tov!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Professor, Wonderful!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Hermes, What the hell does that mean?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Kif, It means I've asked Amy to join my family. And you're all invited to my family swamp for our Fonfon Rubok ceremony.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Amy," If I had ever heard of it, it would have been what I had always dreamed of."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Kif, Oh! And our parents will be meeting for the first time ever.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bender, [He gasps.] That's even more awkward than Fry's two bimbos meeting each other. Count me in. [Leela turns Bender off again. He falls to the floor in a static pose.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Kif," Mr. And Mrs. Wong, aren't you excited that we're all about to be joined in a single family?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Mr. Wong, You can't borrow money.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Mrs. Wong, Kif's parents come late and we have to stand around in swamp getting eaten alive by damn bugs? [She squashes a bug on her neck
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Kif," Mrs. Wong, no. The finial stage of my species' life cycle is a colony of flying hookworms. You just squashed part of my father."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Mr. Kroker, Welcome.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Mrs. Wong," Sorry. I guess you got plenty of bugs to spare though, huh?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Mr. Kroker, That was my left testicle.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bender," [Outside of the conversation] And the awkward meter goes up another notch. Ding, ding, ding, ding ding..."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry," Wow, Colleen, you look so beautiful in the light of the swamp gas."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Colleen, Thanks. This is really fun. I love going to exotic worlds and getting hammered.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry," Me, too."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bartender," Two more Harvey Wallclimbers. [He drops a frog in each, the beverage begins to react with it and overflow.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Zapp," Leela, I can't help but notice you're unescorted. Might I escort you behind that bush for the next five minutes?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Leela, Nothing would revolt me more.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Zapp, Then how about that shrub?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Kif, Ooh! Rubok is begun.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Grand Midwife, I am the Grand Priestess.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry, Aren't you also the Grand Midwife?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Grand Midwife," And the grand Lunch Lady. I work five jobs, all grand. Kif of the clan Kroker, please transcend the Rubok Etlon with your Fonfon Smizmar Ru."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Kif, What?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Grand Midwife," Get in the mud. This mud is the petroleum from a billion generations of Kif's ancestors. [She swirls her staff around in the mud and pushes on Amy's and Kif's forehead, leaving a mark of mud.] As you become one with the ooze, so you become one with the clan Kroker."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Amy," Oh, Kif, it's like a movie with this happening in it."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Grand Midwife, Is the best man present?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Zapp, Guilty as charged.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Grand Midwife, Kindly hose the couple.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Grand Midwife," [Holding up a snake.] As it was, so it is. You may now eat the snake. [The two grab, then take a bite of the snake.] If you so choose. [They both spit it out.] It's not part of the ceremony. I just had an extra snake. Rubok is complete. Throw the bouquet."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Zoidberg, Are you going to eat that? [He devours the bouquet in Colleen's hands.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bender," [From the living room couch] Fry, run, run. Get over here, oh, my God, oh, my God!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry, What? What is it?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bender, Shut up already! Calculon's on TV!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Monique," I beg you, Calculon, don't ring that door chime."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Calculon," I have no choice, Monique. Whoever the blackmailer is, he lives behind this hideous yet strangely familiar door."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Human Friend," Calculon residence. Oh, hello, Mr. Calculon."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Calculon," Son of a bit. This is my house. But that means I'm blackmailing myself. Why didn't you tell me, Monique?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Monique," I tried to, but I couldn’t. Oh, Calculon, I'm afraid you have a fourth personality the other three don't know about, and it and I are lovers!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bender," How's Calculon going to take this, Fry, especially after that humiliating tennis tournament? Fry?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry," [Adjusting his tie in the mirror] Don't know, Bender. Tonight's my big date with Colleen. I got to run."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bender," But me and you like to watch together. Look, I got you a cabbage to snack on. Humans like cabbage, right?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Ride Barter," Step right up to the 2D Tunnel of Love. Not one, not three, but two glorious dimensions for the price of a single ticket. [Fry and Colleen are sitting in a ride car.] Keep your hands in the car, shut up, and have fun."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry," Wow, you even look beautiful in 2D."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Colleen," I do? But from your perspective, I'm just a line segment. [Shot of Colleen as a line segment.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry," A really hot line segment. So, listen, sweetie pie, I was thinking maybe we should take this to the next step."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Colleen, Really?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry, Yes. Colleen...will you be moved in with by me?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Colleen, (SOFT GASP)
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Amy, Way to go.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Zoidberg," Hooray, hooray."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Leela, That's great.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bender, You're moving in with her? Why can't she move in with us? [He curls into a ball at Fry's feet.] I could just curl up at the foot of the bed. (WHIMPERING)
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Professor," Listen up, everyone. I know you've all been extremely worried about the cosmic anomaly."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Hermes," The what? Oh, right."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Professor, But there's good news! We're all going to learn more about it at a scientific conference.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Man walking on screen, ...like a city made of marshmallow.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Stephen Hawking's head, Welcome. I am the pickled head of Stephen Hawking on a way-cool rocket.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Leela (embarrassed)," Black hole Hawking? Wow, if I knew I was going to meet you I would have done something with my hair. [She plays with her hair.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Stephen Hawking, You should have.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,[Cut to Stephen Hawking speaking to an auditorium full of scientists listening to him. A display behind him displays the Anomaly.],
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Stephen Hawking," In conclusion, I understand nothing about the anomaly, even after cashing the huge check I got for writing a book about it."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Professor (standing up)," I know this anomaly is terrifying. But as scientists, is it not our sworn duty to seek out knowledge, even at the cost of our very lives?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,[Cut to] Stephen Hawking, No.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,[Cut to] Farnsworth, I say we must mount an expedition to the anomaly forthwith.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Wernstrom (standing up), I agree.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,[Cut to] Professor, Wernstrom!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,[Cut to] Wernstrom, Professor Farnsworth is correct. Only a manned mission can... [Yelps as he is hit on the head with a pair of dentures.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,"[Cut to Professor snapping his fingers at Leela, indicating a replacement is needed. She puts a pair of dentures in his mouth.]",
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Professor, Don't listen to that crackpot!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Wernstrom, But I'm agreeing with you.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Professor," I'll make you eat those words, you moron! [He spits his dentures into his hand and prepares to throw them, but Hermes and Leela stop him from doing so.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Wernstrom, Ah! [Protects himself with his arms.] I volunteer to lead the expedition. I have a squad of graduate students eager to risk their lives for a letter of recommendation.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,[Cut to] Professor, Your squad sucks bosons! My team is twice as qualified and three times as expendable.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,The PE Crew (standing up), Yeah!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Wernstrom," Oh, tough talk for someone with only one Fields Medal."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Crowd, Ooh!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,[Cut to] Stephen Hawking, Ooh!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Professor," Wernstrom, I ought to..."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Stephen Hawking, I didn't know I could do that. Now quiet down and settle this like men of science.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Professor (sitting down), Very well.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Professor (VO), Let Deathball begin!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Farnsworth," Go, Planet Express!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Wernstrom," Go even more, my team!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,"[The crowd is cheering. Cut to Hermes running across screen from a ball. Five players from Wernstrom team push a ball into a hole and the hole lights up red. Fry looks at the scoreboard. ""Farnsworth"," 0 - Wernstrom  1."" A ball heads down a wall toward him.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry," Leela, header! [He prepares to knock it over to Leela, but it easily tramples over him. Cut to Bender smoking a cigar. A ball hits him, but he doesn't move. It bounces off him then hits a wall and rolls into a hole. The hole lights up blue. Cut to the scoreboard  ""1-1."" Cut to Fry riding on top of a ball. He manoeuvres it around a hole and heads toward an opponent riding another ball.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Colleen (with two beers in her hands), Woo hoo! Bust those balls!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Zoidberg, Hooray! We're equally good! [He is run over from behind by a ball.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Leela," Come on, Bender! Your grandmother could push harder than that!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bender, No crap. My grandmother was a bulldozer.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,[Cut to] Bender, And thus metal man defeated meat man. The end.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Colleen," Come here, winner!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Colleen (looking at one of Wernstrom players)," Come here, loser! [She kisses him.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry (confused)," Colleen, what are you doing? My face is over here."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Colleen," This is my boyfriend, silly!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry (confused), I thought I was your boyfriend.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Colleen, You are.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry (confused)," Well, how can you have two boyfriends?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Colleen," Oh, I don't. I have five. [Three more men walk in and stand next to Chu.] Fry, meet Chu, Bolt, Ndulu, and Shlomo."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Chu, Nihow.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Ndulu, Greetings.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bolt, Pleasure.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry, But... But...
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Colleen, Shlomo and Ndulu will help you move your stuff into my apartment tonight.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Ndulu," Welcome to the relationship, buddy!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry, Hmm? [He spits a piece of butterscotch into his hand.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Chu, There's my butterscotch.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Farnsworth," Congratulations, Deathballers! We've won the right to explore the anomaly!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Zoidberg, What? I thought I was playing for my freedom!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Farnsworth," No. [He inserts a crank and turns it to power a hologram of the Anomaly.] Now, I've often said ""good news"" when sending you on a mission of extreme danger. So when I say this anomaly is dangerous, you can imagine how dangerous I really think it is."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Hermes, Not dangerous at all?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Farnsworth," Actually, quite dangerous indeed."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Hermes, That is quite dangerous!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Farnsworth, Indeed. Now stop shilly-shallying! Prep the ship and line up for your pre-flight coffee enemas!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,[Pan to] Enema Bot, Warning. The enema you are about to enjoy is extremely hot.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry," I don't know what to do, Leela. Should I move in with Colleen and her four other boyfriends?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Leela, What are you going to do? Sleep in a big pile like hamsters?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry, No! It's not like that. Everyone gets his own room and a shelf in the refrigerator.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Zoidberg (walking by)," Take the deal, Fry! If there's a delicious cake, isn't it better to have one slice than none at all? Even if four other guys eat the other four slices, and they're all thrusting their sweaty naked bodies against the cake?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Amy (with Kif)," Only one thing matters, Fry. Do you really love Colleen, like I love my little squeezle? [She squeezes him and his head expands and eyes expand out of his head. He giggles."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry, Yeah. I do love her.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Kif (high pitched voice)," Then things will work out. [Amy lets go of him and he contracts to normal size, but one eye remains out. Amy pokes it and it pops back to normal size.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,[Cut to] Farnsworth, Whoa!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Enema Bot, Double espresso for Philip Fry?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry (standing up)," Sorry, I'm not going on the mission. I'm moving in with Colleen!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Kif," Good for you, Fry."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Zoidberg, Hooray!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Amy, Alright!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry, I'll just take that to go. [He is poured a coffee and it's handed to him.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Colleen, Yay! [She hugs Fry.] Welcome to your new home!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry," Thanks, Colleen. And listen, I'm sorry I got jealous before. [They walk through the doors.] I'm just happy to be here with you."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Ndulu, Want a slice of delicious cake?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bender(VO), (Gasps) The anomaly!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Amy, It's so anomalous.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Hermes, I'm feeling dread deep in my dreads!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Farnsworth, Wernstrom!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Wernstrom," Yes, and I'm afraid I have disturbing news about the anomaly. You see..."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Farnsworth," How did you get this number? Hermes, hang up on him in the rudest possible manner."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Hermes (saluting Farnsworth)," Yes, sir! [He drops his pants and grasps the phone between his buttocks.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Wernstrom," No, not the crack slam! [Hermes slams the phone down and the screen goes to static.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Colleen," Oh, my life rocks. [She pours the wine into six glasses.] I've got good wine, five sweethearts, and today, I was promoted to Chief of Police."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry (toasting Colleen), Here's to you.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Chu, Me?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry," No, Colleen. I'm making a romantic toast."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Chu, Sorry.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry, You have the most beautiful eyes I think I...
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Ndulu, Thank you.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry, I'm not talking to you!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Ndulu," Then I am not talking to you, either."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Schlomo, Will everyone be quiet a little? I want to hear what he has to say!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry, Thank you.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Schlomo," Not you, you Verstinkener. You're just here 'cause she likes cave men from the stupid ages."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bolt," Oh, look who's talking. You're just here 'cause she got matzoh fever."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Ndulu," So, what's the explanation for you, moron fever? (laughs)"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Colleen," Enough! All of you! I love you. Most people in this world don't have what we have. Let's just be grateful, okay?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,ALL, Yeah.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Chu," Yeah, you're right."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry," So, Colleen, you look really nice."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Colleen," Oh, thanks. I got dressed up for my date. [A car horn honks. Colleen runs toward the door.] There he is. Don't wait up!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Fry (angrily)," That's it. I thought I was okay with this, but I'm not. I'm breaking up with you! [Musical score is played. Colleen looks as Fry sadly and he retains his anger.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Ndulu, Me?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bender (stammering)," Why are we risking our lives? Can't we just send in a robotic drone? [He looks over at the crew, who are expectedly staring back at him.] What's everybody looking at me for?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bender," ""Let's send a robot to explore it. 'Cause you can always buy another one for 20 bucks."""
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Leela, Really?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bender," Well, it's 30 bucks, and there's a $10-mail-in rebate. When the League of Robots hears about this, they won't be pleased. Oh, you'll pay, my darlings."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Hermes," The League of Robots doesn't exist, tin mon. It's just a cartoon for babies."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bender," Oh, yeah? Then how come when I was a kid, I had a whole sticker book of them? [She airlock doors shut and Bender's voice is muffled.] Answer that with your precious logic."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,Bender (within inches of the anomaly)," Bender to crew. I have reached the gateway to another universe. I feel awed and strangely humbled by the momentous solemnity of this occasion. (yelling) Hey, other universe, bite my shiny metal... [He thrusts his ass into the anomaly, but he and the ship are shot away from it by a pink blast. Everybody is screaming and bricks fall out of Bender.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 1,,
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,,
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," I can't remember anything except a blinding light and a searing ass pain. I better check my black box. BENDER  ""The light! It's blinding! And the ass pain! It's searing!"" So that's what happened."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Amy," Hey, Bender! Look who's here to cheer you up."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender, I don't need cheering up. I'm perfectly...
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Calculon (entering the room)," Greetings, sick fan."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender, (Gasps) TV's Calculon! (He coughs)
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Calculon," [Paparazzi's take pictures of Calculon through the open door. He walks over to Bender's side and knees down.] You poor, mangled husk of what was once a robot! What right hath fate to pluck a sweet, dimple-cheeked mechanism in the flower of his youth? And... Scene! There, that was some free acting for you. [He walks toward the door.] Ordinarily, to see acting like that, you'd have to sit through a tampon commercial."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Colleen (sobbing)," Where did we go wrong, Fry? We were meant to be together!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Schlomo," Nu, I'm freezing my tokhes off here."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Colleen (happily)," Just a sec, honey!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," I'm back, idiots! [They all cheer.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Zoidberg," You look wonderful, robut! I wish I could afford to go to a hospital. I'm dreadfully sick. [He sneezes a green mucus all over the table in front of him.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," (laughs) I feel great, and I owe it all to Calculon. [He removes his wheels and hangs them on the coat rack.] His visit really inspired me. [He walks over to the Conference Table.] I finally know what I want to be when I grow up."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Hermes, You want to co-star in his TV show? Like that time you already did that?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender, No. I'm gonna be a stalker!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Leela, That's not really a career. More of a felony.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," Man, I'm gonna stalk his brains out. [He types on the keyboard in front of Farnsworth.] Ooh! Big news on the Calculon fan site! There's a flash mob headed for his plastic surgeon's office!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Plastic Surgeon," There, that's as big as I can make it. But I caution you, it looks completely unrealistic."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Calculon, You let me worry about that! Just do your job.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,"[The door slams open with Bender and other clamouring photographers snapping pictures of Calculon's pride.] Dear God, no!",
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender, Neat! [He takes a photo.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Man, Get a shot of that.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,"Fatbot (standing outside ""Robot Plastic Surgery"")"," Oh boy, oh boy, he's here. [A crowd is flooding in the doors.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Crazed Fan," Calculon, I love you! Have my baby!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Calculon," Back, you lunatic! [He pushes her face and she falls over.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Crazed Fan, He touched me!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," Sign my ass! [He pulls out his ass plate and a pen as Calculon dashes off with a blanket. Surrounded by the mob, be grabs the surgeon and hurls him at the crowd. Crashes are heard. Bender groans.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth (sniffing)(VO)," Emergency! Emergency! Everyone to the Calamitorium! [Leela, Hermes, Amy and Zoidberg rush in. Zoidberg is whooping.] Leela, smell this."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Leela, Can I wipe it off first?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth," No time, woman! No time!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Leela (sniffing)," Hmm. Smells like angel dust. [She pulls off the spouts and a ""pop"" is heard.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth," Exactly! That's a discontinuous electromagnetic field. Wernstrom tried to warn me, but I was too damn stubborn! Hermes, get Wernstrom on the line so I can apologize."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Wernstrom, Ogden Wernstrom speaking.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth (whispering), Tell him I'm not here!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Leela, Professor!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth," Oh, very well. Wernstrom, I've been a vainglorious fool! If you can find it in your heart to forgive me, your tiny little heart, would you consider a scientific collaboration?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Wernstrom," Sir, I'd be honored. [He stands up from his chair to reveal he is wearing a purple thong.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Wernstrom," As I attempted to warn you, the laws of electromagnetism change abruptly at the anomaly. [He pulls a Pocket Pal out of his lab coat.] Observe."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Pocket Pal, Play time is fun time.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Wernstrom (while hurling the robot into the anomaly), Not this time.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth," My heavens! If only I'd heeded your warning, I'd have known it was impossible to cross the barrier!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,"Wernstrom (while opening a barrel labelled ""Lab Animals"")"," But note what happens when I instead throw this laboratory koala. [The Koala gnaws on his sleeve. he tosses the animal into the anomaly, but it passes through unscathed and flies out the window.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth," It passed through unharmed. [A thud is heard.] So living beings can enter the other universe, but electrical devices can't?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Wernstrom, My hypothesis exactly.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth, Then we must mount a second expedition without delay. Right after we blow up more robots.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Wernstrom, Agreed.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth, Play time is fun time.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Calculon, Who are you?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," Bender, your biggest fan."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Calculon, Are you going to murder me?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," Unlikely. In my mind, we're friends. This diorama proves it, see? [He pulls a crudely constructed piece of himself and Calculon playing Ping Pong.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Calculon," Sir, your derangement is impressive. I'm appointing you my official stalker."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," You shan't be disappointed. Pleasant dreams. [Calculon turns the lights off and his eyes close, but Bender's do not. Instead they extend out towards Calculon's eyes. Calculon opens his eyes and looks at Bender's as they quickly move even closer to his own."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth," Now that I've teamed up with my friend, Dr. (spiteful tone) Wernstrom, (normal tone) I feel certain we can successfully penetrate the other universe."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Wernstrom, It's the greatest scientific opportunity since you yourself sent men to the moon in 1969.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Nixon, I always regretted that. Nothing up there but dry rocks and those revolting onion men.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth, But...
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Nixon," You East Coast intellectuals had your chance. Now beat it! From here on in, this is a military matter."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Nixon," People of the universe, please welcome Rear Brigadier Zapp Brannigan."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Zapp," Thank you, thank you. Well deserved. (To Kif) Kif, stand in that hole so I look taller. [Kif steps into the hole and sighs.] (To crowd) Ever since man first left his cave and met a stranger with a different language and a new way of looking at things, the human race has had a dream. To kill him, so we don't have to learn his language or his new way of looking at things."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Wernstrom, Give science a chance!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth," Less invasions, more equations!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Nixon," Damn long-hairs. Knock some sense into them, Chief O'Hallahan."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Colleen," Yes, sir! [She blows a whistle as Smitty, URL and herself run toward the two protestors. The three begin clonking Wernstrom and Farnsworth on the head with night sticks that resemble light sabres. Cut to Fry watching Colleen beat Wernstrom in slow motion. Her helmet falls off and her long hair flies around her head as she goes in for another hit. And another. Cut back to Fry with Leela in a crowd.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Fry (sobbing)," I can't take it, Leela. I need to go away. Far away, forever."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Leela," Aw, I know how you feel, Fry. There are times when I also feel like you need to go away."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Amy," Be careful, my little, teeny, greeny weenie."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Zapp (grabbing/covering his groin)," That's just a fungal infection... Oh, she's talking to you, Kif."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Kif," Goodbye, my love. [He is pulled away as the ground he stands on move them onto the ship. The engines start up and the Nimbus departs with an escort of heli/hover-copters.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender (to Calculon)," Wow, how come humans get to do all the fun stuff? This is exactly the sort of thing that ought to be handled by (whispering) The League of Robots."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Calculon," (He laughs.) That's adorable, Bender. You actually believe in the League of Robots?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," You mean, there's really no such thing? Then who's there to mete out justice when an outdated robot is melted into belt buckles? Who's there to defend our honour when a rude human brings a blush to a robo-virgin's cheek?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Calculon, No one.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender, Oh.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,"[Zoom into a close-up of Bender's face to see a tear run down his cheek. Cut to Amy standing alone, watching the Nimbus leave for space. She turns around to face the screen and a tear runs down her cheek. Cut to Farnsworth, still being beaten by the three officers. A tear runs down his cheek. Cut to a shot of the Nimbus flying with its escort, zoom into a window labelled ""Stowaway Hatch 35"," Unauthorized Access Only"" to reveal Fry standing in it. He looks back to face Earth and a tear runs down his cheek.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender (VO)," Now that I know robots are worthless, with no League of Robots to protect us from the fleshy menace known as man, I have resolved to kill myself. In lieu of flowers, please beat yourselves in the face with rusty chains. Your friend, Bender."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Zoidberg, Ow.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Suicide Booth, Please select mode of death.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," Clumsy bludgeoning, please."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Suicide Booth," You have selected clumsy bludgeoning. For an additional $10, would you like your eyes scooped out with a melon-baller?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," What the heck, I'll treat myself."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Zapp, Enemy in range. Prepare to launch universe-to-universe missile.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Kif, Preparing to launch U.U.M. [He grabs a small hammer hanging on the wall and breaks the glass protecting a larger hammer hanging on the wall. He grabs the larger hammer and smashes the glass protecting a large red button. He presses the button and a missile is loaded for fire in the bridge. Alarms are blaring.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Zapp," Hell of a thing to send a universe to certain doom. Fun, though. Makes a man feel big."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender (tapping his foot)," Come on, come on, I didn't ask to die of boredom!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Suicide Booth, You are now dead. Please take your receipt. [A receipt is printed out and it lands on a large pile of other receipts.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender, What's... What's happening?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Hooded Robot, Kneel before the candle.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender, Don't hurt me! I'll betray anyone!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Hooded Robot, Bender Bending Rodriguez...
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Calculon, [He removes his hood.] Welcome to the League of Robots!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Zapp," Ready? [Kif positions his finger over the launch button.] And... Fi-... [Kif hesitates to push the button. Zapp laughs.] Almost fooled you there. [Kif sighs.] Fire! [Kif scrambles and presses the button. The missile tries to launch, but it is jammed. Alarms begin blaring.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Francine, Missile jam. Missile jam.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Zapp," I heard you the first time, Francine."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Francine, Sorry.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Zapp," Kif, climb down there and un-jam it, would you? Be a dear. [Kif sighs.] And stop sighing so much. [Kif sighs again.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Calculon," Tell us, Bender. Are you worthy of membership in the League?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender, Worthier than the average robot.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Calculon, Then prove it. [Two doors slide open to reveal a very long and large stairway lit by torches.] Upon each step is a test.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," Okay, but if it's culturally biased, I'm suing your ass."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Calculon, Test number one. The test of the beer mug! [British Robot places a mug on the first step.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,British Robot," Quite right, quite so."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,ALL, Drink the mug! Drink the mug!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender, I accept your challenge. [He downs the beer and tosses the mug aside.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,ALL, Hurray!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Hedonism Bot, The test of the flagon!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,ALL, Drink the flagon! Drink the flagon!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender, Are all the tests going to involve drinking?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Calculon," It never occurred to me before, but yes."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender, Wohoo! Just like med school! [He drinks from the flagon and the robots cheer.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Zapp," Ready yet, Kif?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,"Kif (tinkering with the missile, legs hanging out of the missile bay)"," Just give me one more... [Zapp is already pressing FIRE repeatedly. Interior shot of the missile bay shows the missile begin to correctly launch and the hatch closes. In the process, Kif's arms became stuck in the missile and his legs became stuck in the hatch door.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Kif," Oh, no. [The missile launches and Kif's legs stretch longer and longer as he moves with the missile toward the anomaly. He is constantly groaning.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Billionaire Bot," The test of the infinitely priceless 1,000-year-old brandy. [A eye dropper is used to extract a drop of the brandy from a crystal bottle and he drops it in a wine glass. Bender grabs the glass, sips the brandy, crushes the glass in his hands and grabs the bottle from Billionaire Bot. He drinks all of the brandy and throws the bottle into his mouth, then belches fire and ignites Billionaire Bot's hat. Calculon opens a steel door.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Calculon, Presenting our newest member. [He moves aside to show Bender.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Fender," That's right, baby!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender, Hot diggity daffodil!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Fry," And so, to everyone and everything I've ever known, I say my last goodbye."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Kif," Hello. So, how are you, Fry?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Fry, Pretty good. You?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Kif, [He is pulled back towards the ship by his elastic legs.] Well... Oh.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Zapp," Mmm. Kif, get over here. You've got to try this! [He licks the goo off his lips with his tongue.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Amy (sobbing), At least Kiffy died quickly.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Hermes," Yes, but according to the Old Farmer's Wikipedia, the amazing thing about Kif's species is that the remains continue suffering for up to six hours after death."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Amy (sobbing), That's so interesting!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," Don't ask where I was last night. For all you know, I was at home, perhaps baking a strudel. What's her problem? Somebody die or something?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Leela," Kif's dead, Bender."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender, Nailed it!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Zapp," My condolences, Amy. Allow me to present you with the last known photo of Lieutenant Kroker. [He holds a framed picture in front of her face. Kif is splattered against a wall, rocket in his chest and one arm squished off.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Mrs. Wong," We so sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Kroker. Terrible shame about Froggy."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Mrs. Kroker, Thank you for your kind words.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Mr. Wong," [He sprays a breath mind into his mouth.] Yeah, yeah, real sad. Want some breath spray? Cinnamon flavour, taste like pie. [He sprays both Mr. and Mrs. Kroker once and both of them cough while flying hook worms drop to the ground.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," [He places a wreath of flowers on Kif's urn labelled ""L.O.R.""] This is from the league of you-don't-need-to-know."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Grand Midwife, I am the grand funeral director!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Zoidberg, Do you validate parking?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Grand Midwife, It is always a terrible tragedy when a swarm outlives its own bulboid. [She grabs Kif's urn.] So it is with great sorrow that I now commit the goo that was once Kif to the petroleum of his ancestors. [She unscrews the jar and turns it over but the goo does not drop out. She shakes it multiple times.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Leela, Whack the bottle!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Hermes," No, from the bottom ! It works better!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Amy (sobbing), Just stick a butter knife in it!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Grand Midwife," [She removes the goo with a butter knife.] There, I got most of it. The burial is complete. I will now sing the sacred hymn. It's not part of the ceremony, just a little something that I wrote."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender (interrupting the song), Next!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Amy," It may sound strange, but seeing Kif's mutilated remains poured into the mud made me really sad."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Leela, Mutilation is never easy.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Amy (crying), I don't think I'll ever love again.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Leela," Oh, you don't mean that. Love can surprise you at any time in your life."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Zapp," Surprise! [He motions for a kiss with his lips, but Leela punches him in the face with both hands.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Fry," Whoa, it kind of takes your breath away. [His Oxygen Pack displays ""OXYGEN SYSTEM FAILURE"" on the screen accompanied by a beeping noise, but a bolt of lightening quickly blows out the screen.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,URL," Look alive, death row. Your saggy asses got a visitor. [He turns off the laser bars.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth, Regular or conjugal?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,URL, [He shrugs.] She looked like a freak to me.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Leela," The guard operating the x-ray machine came down with a sudden case of broken neck, so I was able to bring you that delicious cake you wanted. [She pulls a pink, multi-level cake out from under the table, points to her eye and blinks.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth, I don't understand. Are you winking or blinking?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Leela, [She sighs and pulls out a pair of LED glasses that have two eyes on the front. She uses them to wink at the two jailers.] Hang on a second.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth, Got it!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," Ahh, yes, I'm here to repair my horse."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Shop Owner, Is the horse's name (whispers) Hot Beans?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," No! I mean, yes."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,British Robot," So it seems a human had been rather injured by a knife, and as his... As his blood, you know, I think that's what they call it..."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Calculon," Quite correct, sir. Blather on!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,British Robot," As it drained away, he said... He said, Take me to a dock. No doubt he intended to say doctor, but he was unable to complete his thought, you see, being as he had died. So, taking him at his word, we dragged his corpse to the waterfront, whereupon the seagulls fed upon it."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender, Humans are dumb and they die easy!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Hedonism Bot, Quite!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Billionaire Bot," Speaking of humans, have I shown you my new monocle? [He holds out his monocle.] Cost me a king's ransom. Made from a king, don't you know!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Hedonism Bot," Oh, how repulsively decadent!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Billionaire Bot," Yes. But more importantly, it allows me to see the smiling faces of my children for the first time since I lost my vision in that horrible banking accident."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," May I see that for a second? [He grabs it from Billionaire Bot and examines it while walking over to a table.] My, but that's interesting! [He places it on the table and beats it with a fire pit shovel until it bursts, and then some. The other robots are stunned.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Hedonism Bot, I say!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Billionaire Bot, I'm blind!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Calculon," My God, Bender! This is a civilized organization! The rules specifically..."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," [He pulls a book out of his robe titled ""Robot's Rules of Order.""] May I make a point of order, President Calculon?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Calculon, Must you?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender, Yes.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," The bylaws specifically state that no human may set foot in the League of Robots! If he has a human part, he's part human!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Hedonism Bot," Oh, my! Then I too have a human part I must expel. And I plan to enjoy the experience. Ta-ta !"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,British Robot," Bender, you've rigidly applied the law with no regard for its intent. Well done! You'll go far in this organization."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Bender," Oh, you're just gettin' to know Bender. [He taps on his empty glass and Boxy immediately moves from filling Calculon's glass to fill Bender's. Calculon scowls at Bender.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Wernstrom," Curses! If we could only turn up the gain, we might smell clear through to the other universe! But we can't adjust it without a screwdriver."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth, Wait a moment. I think I was just shanked with a screwdriver! [He groans as he yanks a screwdriver out of his back.] Yes!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Wernstrom, A little more. A little less. Heavens to meteoroid! Smell this!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth, Holy mother of invention!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Wernstrom, We must notify the President at once!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth," But how can we? Oh, I wish, I wish, I wish we weren't in prison!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth, Pazuzu!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Pazuzu," [He lands next to them and they grab onto his front legs.] You have one wish left, Professor."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Nixon, Sometimes... Always... Never! You again? This better be damned important. I'm right in the middle of a Cosmo survey!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,Farnsworth," You'll want to hear this, Mr. President. For we have sniffed where no man has sniffed before!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 2,,
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,,
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Mayor Poopenmeyer, Look! Up in the sky!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Hermes, It's a bird!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Hattie McDoogal, It's a plane!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Super Hero, I am so out of here! [He flies off screen.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zapp (VO)," Captain's log, star date, the year of the tiger. The battle has been bravely fought, and the suffering of our troops beyond measure. But the alien is invulnerable, and our defeat inevitable. That much is obvious, even from my remote command post here at the Times Square Applebee's. [Cut to a shot of Zapp sitting in a booth next to a window controlling the Nimbus with a joystick. The anomaly and tentacles can be seen through the window to his left.] Waiter! Take this fried mozzarella back to the kitchen and fry it some more."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Nixon, Har-harrooo!  The tentacle's coming towards Earth and there's no stopping it. King Kong's too old to save us this time.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Farnsworth," We have only one hope, Mr. President. We must encase the entire planet in a protective sphere of my patented, ultra-hard Diamondium!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Wernstrom, Diamondium? (He scoffs.) I could gum through that with my dentures behind my back. My trademarked Diamondillium is twice as hard!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Farnsworth, Twice as hard as your head! Which makes it still fairly soft!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Nixon," Now look here, you Poindexters. I don't care how you decide. Just decide!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Farnsworth, Diamondillium it is.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Bender (standing in front of the fireplace)," So, hey, Calculon, I know I'm the new guy, and, pardon my ignorance, but when do we kill all humans?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Calculon, Never.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Bender," But what about our motto? [A shot of a plaque above the fireplace that says ""KILL ALL HUMANS!""] Doesn't it mean anything?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Calculon," Oh, Bender, your idealism is heart-warming. But the League of Robots hasn't killed a human in over 800 years. And that was a very sick girl scout."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,British Robot, Quite sick indeed.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Calculon," Sweet, innocent Bender. [He pats Bender on the head and flicks his antenna. Bender looks up at Calculon evilly.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Wernstrom, I declare my impenetrable Diamondillium sphere complete! [The crowd cheers and Wernstrom waves to them.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Farnsworth," Now look here, Wernstrom. You're making it sound as if the sphere was your idea when we both know... [Shattering glass is heard and a tentacle is through the sphere.] It was! All credit to my colleague, Ogden Wernstrom!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,H. G. Blob, It's horrible!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zoidberg, I can't make it! Go on without me! [Pull back to reveal he's holding onto Leela's boot.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela," I'm trying! [She struggles to pull him, but slowly does.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zoidberg, Go on without me faster!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Hermes, Sweet squid of Madrid! The tentacle got Fry!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela," Quick, hand me my machete! We can still save his legs!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry," Silence! [The crowd goes quiet.] I have traveled far and seen deep, and I have come to know the purpose of our existence."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,[Cut to] Randy, Finally.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry (who is now shown on the Jumbotron), Thou shalt love the tentacle!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,[Cut to] Farnsworth," Well, at least we don't have to love one another."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,[Establishing shot of New New York. The city has three large spouts of tentacles coming through the sphere that spread all over the city. Cut back to Fry hovering above the stage.],
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry, A new age has begun. The age of the tentacle! [Tentacles enter into the crowd through the fire hydrants.] Open your necks and receive the love!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Warden Vogel," Ow, my neck!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Morgan Proctor," Ow, my neck!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fishy Joe," My neck feels perfectly... [A tentacle attaches to his neck.] Ow, my neck!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zoidberg," Hooray, Zoidberg escaped! [He is attacked by a tentacle.] Hooray, Zoidberg loves the tentacle! [He is pulled through the doggy door by the tentacle.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Hermes, It got Zoidberg!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Farnsworth," Oh, I never knew how much I'd miss him until he was gone! Not that much, as it turns out."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry," Thus sayeth the tentacle, ""Verily, thou shalt rejoice in the house of the tentacle."""
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela," Fry, listen to yourself. You've been brainwashed."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry," No, I'm just trying to fit my diction to the importance of what I'm saying. Please, let me speak. [A laser points at his forehead.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela (pointing a gun at Fry), I'm listening.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry," Don't be afraid of the tentacle, Leela. [He grabs part of the tentacle that is attached to him and pets it.] It's beautiful and it loves me. And I love it. [A second laser appears on his forehead and a cocking gun is heard.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela (pointing two guns at Fry), Aw. That's so nice for both of you.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry," I know it may seem strange that I have feelings for an octopus monster from another universe. And yes, perhaps it's not the storybook romance that's been crammed down our throats by (quoting the syllables) ""Hollywood."" But the Monsterpus has loved us from afar since we were amoebas. [He looks up at the anomaly. Leela slips off her boot and pulls out another gun to aim at Fry's forehead while he turned away. A third laser appears on his forehead.] Only when the space anomaly opened could it finally express a billion years of longing."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela, [She pulls the guns away from him.] Really? It loves us that much? Fire Diamondium cannon!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry, Hey! [He yelps as he's constantly swung out of harm's way.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela, No effect. The crystals are bouncing off the tentacle like meatballs off Mothra.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Wernstrom," Oh, what a surprise. I told you Diamondium was worthless!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Farnsworth," Wernstrom, quit hyping your cheap Diamondillium and look at this."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Wernstrom, Uh-oh.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Hermes, What oh?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Farnsworth," According to this blinking light, the tentacle is made of electro-matter, matter's bad-ass grandma! Nothing from our universe can cut through it. Not Diamondium, not Diamondillium, not even your wife's pound cake, Hermes! (To Wernstrom ) She's a terrible cook. (To All ) Anyway, we're all dead."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Bender," [He sighs.] So, Bender, is something wrong? Who said that? Oh, it was me! 'Cause my roommate doesn't notice or even care that I'm upset!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry," What, Bender? Is something wrong?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Bender," Yes! I joined a club I thought was cool, but it turns out all the leaguie-weegies are totally lame. That's what we call ourselves, ""leaguie-weegies."""
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry, I'm sorry. I should've asked what was bothering you. [A shot of Fry's back reveals the tentacle reaching from Fry's upper neck to lower spine in a very scar-like manner.] I've been kind of preoccupied.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Bender, With what?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry," [while putting on his vestment] Well, I went to another universe, and I fell in love with a giant octopus, and now I'm pope of a new religion."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Bender, Weren't you already pope of something?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry, [He puts on his Pope hat.] No.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Bender," Oh. Well, I'm just saying I'd like you to show an interest in my life, too."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry," Okay, let's catch up soon. But right now, I gotta go shove a tentacle into everyone in China. [He squeezes/yanks on the tentacle and is yanked through the window of the apartment and out into space.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Linda (Screaming)," They're coming! Those horrible, horrible things are coming! (Calm) Morbo?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,[Cut to] Morbo," As the universe falls prey to the revolting alien, only a few isolated pockets of resistance remain."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Linda, Those pockets sure are missing out on a great thing.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela, Amy?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Amy," Sorry. I thought I saw a tentacle, but it was just a harmless land squid. [She points to a land squid as it squeals and shuffles back into a hole in the wall. She sighs as she walks over to the cocoffee machine.] I better have some cocoffee."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Hermes," When I gave up diapers, my parents promised exactly this would never happen!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela," Nobody panic! Just get to the panic room! [Amy, Hermes, Farnsworth and Wernstrom go through the door while Leela holds off the pursuing tentacles.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry," Well done, people! We had a great first week. We got 90% of world leaders, everyone who bought a Hanes undershirt, and this year's most promising new R&B group, give it up for the Grammy-nominated Funkalistics!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,The Funkalistics, [They harmonize.] (singing) Talkin' 'bout the tentacle!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! I was up all night inventing, and then finally, I invented!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Amy, Invented what?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Farnsworth," [He holds up half of a toilet paper tube with an elastic attached to each side.] The neck protector, [He holds up a smaller version.] the neck protector junior, and now, for a limited time, [He holds up a version with a flower on it.] the lady neck protector!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Hermes, I'll take two. My neck is huge.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Farnsworth (Typing on the keyboard.)," We're perfectly safe now. Time to stop living like a bunch of nervous nellies. [A diagrams on the screen shows a dotted line disappearing from around the building. ""SECURITY SYSTEM OFFLINE"" flashes on the screen.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela," [She examines the invention.] Professor, these look like you cut them from cardboard toilet paper tubes."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Farnsworth," So? [The hangar doors retract open.] Lots of important inventions are made from toilet paper tubes. [Farnsworth looks back to the keyboard and screen and Leela spots a tentacle in Farnsworth's neck.] Microscopes, the internet, tentacle polish..."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela, It got the professor!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Hermes," Wait, why am I screaming? It got me, too! [He floats up to Farnsworth.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Wernstrom," Stop, in the name of love!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela, Crud. We may be the last two normal people on Earth. At least I won't have to trim my elbow talons anymore.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Amy (Crying), I'm scared! And I miss Kif!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela," It's okay to cry, Amy. Come here, I'm wearing absorbent shoulder straps. [They hug.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zapp, [He pops the top of his head out of a dumpster.] Mmm. What an erotic display of girl-on-girl consolation.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela, Zapp?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zapp," Hurry, Leela, we don't have much time to begin repopulating Earth. Go brush your teeth. I'll be waiting for you naked under this keh-suh-dilluh. [He places the Mexican treat on his head and saunters back down into the dumpster. Hermes floats into the alley with a gang of tentacles around him. Amy, Leela and Zapp gasp.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Hermes," Stop resisting, my brethren! Don't you want to be part of something bigger than yourselves? Like a big crazy monster? [Zapp whimpers.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry," So we got her, huh? Bring her in!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zoidberg, Do it already! [He motions at someone.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry," Hello, Colleen."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Colleen," Fry, please!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Colleen," If this is about your futon, I sold it to pay the phone bill that you skipped out on!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry," Colleen wasn't satisfied with me. Were you, Colleen?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Colleen," Come on, Fry, this isn't cool!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry, She had to have four other boyfriends! I guess she never thought I'd become tentacle pope of the world!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Colleen," You know what? It's true! You weren't enough for me! No one man is! You were great, but you weren't Chinese, you weren't Cameroonian, and you certainly were not the ""king of karaoke,"" as you so often claimed. [Fry is aghast.] And if your ego can't take that, then you don't deserve to be tentacle pope of anything!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry (Raising into the air with clenched fists.)," Oh, yeah, Colleen? Well, I've got one thing to say to you. [He lowers down to her.] (Calm) I completely agree!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Colleen (Confused)," You, you... What?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry (Walking with Colleen.), Why should you be satisfied with one man when love needs to share itself with the whole universe?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Colleen," Wow, Fry. You know, that's really... [Fry moves a tentacle in front of her face and she shrieks as it grabs onto her neck.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry," Love the tentacle, honey."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Colleen, I do love the tentacle.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry," Come on out, guys! [Chu, Schlomo, Ndulu and Bolt come out of hiding.] There's enough love for everybody! [They all hug and raise into the air higher.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zoidberg, Aw. [He throws up salt water fish and a duck with water into two buckets. The duck flaps it feathers and quacks.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Amy, We're trapped!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela (Into her Wristlomojacker)," Help, help! Is anyone out there?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Bender (Over Leela's Wristlomojacker)," Bender to Leela. I read you. [Pull out, Bender is leaning against the wall a couple of feet away from them.] (Direct) 'Sup, bigboots?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela," Bender, we need a place to hide!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Amy, Please!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zapp, Pretty please!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Bender (Laughing), You humans are so cute when you're scared. In here.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Destructor (Leaning against a building), My leg feels funny!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Bender, Humans are disgusting! I opened one up once. I almost barfed.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Destructor, Did you know their hair just keeps growing and growing? My leg feels funny!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Amy," Leela, you're crushing me with your rock-hard butt."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela, Sorry.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zapp, [A close view of his face. It is moving back and forth.] Mmm. I can only imagine what rock-hard part of Leela is crushing me. [Pull back to reveal it is a actuator ramming into the back of his head.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Calculon, Anyone mind if I turn up the heat a tad?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zapp, I can't take it! I'm being steamed in my own velour!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Bender, Death to humans!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Destructor, My leg feels better!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Amy," Hi, Bender."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Calculon," Bender, you know these humans?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Bender," Of course not! Who are you humans and why am I pointing you to the exit? [He rushes them towards a hallway.] Go, go, go!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela (While running away.)," Thanks for everything, Bender! [A bookshelf slides in front of the path they escaped from.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Bender, Death to all of you!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Calculon," Bender, methinks thou doth protest too much."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Hedonism Bot, It seems Bender hates humans the way I hate having my nipples polished with industrial sandpaper.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,British Robot (Laughing), Quite right.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Calculon (Laughing)," It's okay, Bender, to heir is human."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Bender," Sir, you forget yourself!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Bender, I challenge you to a duel on the field of honor.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Hedonism Bot," Oh, my... [He puts his hand on his forehead and faints, falling onto Boxy and crushing him. Boxy frantically beeps, but they slow in speed and pitch and eventually stop.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zapp," Leela, it's getting dark. We may have to make a tent out of Amy's skin."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Amy," Look, there's an abandoned cabin!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zapp, Even so.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela, We're in luck. This must have been the cabin of a soup bootlegger back in the days of soup prohibition.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zapp," [He drinks a ladle-full of soup.] Oh, yeah. Bathtub minestrone."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Amy (Sobbing)', Poor Kif! I can't believe he's gone forever!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zapp," Ditto on the grief there, Amy."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Amy," You miss him, too?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zapp," [He sits next to her.] More than you, as his mere wife, could ever understand. He was my fourth lieutenant, for God's sake, and bore the peppermill at the captain's table."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Amy, Really?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zapp (sobbing)," Oh, Amy, I miss him so! Hardly a month goes by that I don't think of him. But you know, in a way, he's still with us. [Amy looks around.] Do you feel his presence?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Amy (Crying), I'm not sure.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zapp, It's over here. [Amy moves closer to Zapp and looks around more.] Closer.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela, Amy! Zapp! I fetched up some fresh soup!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zapp," Sorry you had to find out like this, Leela. I was hoping you'd see it on YouTube first. [Two tentacles sneak up behind the two of them and Leela points at them. She is too scared to speak.] As my ex-lover, you're naturally shocked and jealous, but you may well get your chance again someday. How about today at 4 00?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Amy," Hey, this isn't so bad."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zapp," She's right. Leela, you must try the tentacle. It's like my soul is wearing a velour body glove."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela," Get off me! I'm saving my neck for a rich, handsome Dracula."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Farnsworth, What I love most about the tentacle is that I don't need to move my bowels anymore. It's all handled by that family in Evanston.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela," No, it can't be. [The lights flick on.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Farnsworth (With many tentacles behind him)," Leela, what's your favourite thing about the tentacle? [He gasps and the tentacles react to it.] You don't have a tentacle! Get her! Get her some love!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zoidberg," You're on in five minutes, Excellency. You sure you don't want your comedy pope staff? [The staff moves up and down and a slide whistle is heard.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry, The tentacle monster is about to address the world. It's too serious.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zoidberg, Oh. [The staff moves down and a slide whistle is heard again.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela (From the doorway)," Hello, Fry."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry, Leela? How did you get past my sumo ninjas?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela, I told them something so shocking that they let me by.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry, What's that?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela, I love the tentacle. [She turns a little to reveal a tentacles is in her neck.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zoidberg," We're rolling in three, two... What? We're already rolling?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry, Love the tentacle!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,ALL, Love the tentacle!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry," Loved ones, the Monsterpus has revealed unto me its name."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Morbo, What is our love's name?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry," Yivo. Yivo is the lover of all beings, male and female. But Yivo has no gender, thus Yivo has proclaimed that instead of ""he"" or ""she,"" we are to use the word ""shklee."" And instead of ""him"" or ""her,"" we are to use the word ""shklim,"" or ""shkler."""
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Hermes, Phew! I've been sweating the nomenclature all week.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry," So here shklee is shklerself, Yivo!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Colleen," Yay, Yivo!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Yivo," Attention, beings of Universe Gamma."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zoidberg, Where?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Yivo, Here.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Zoidberg, I had a hunch.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Yivo," I am Yivo. In your universe, you are many, but in my universe, I am one. [On the Jumbotron, people are watching him.] For a trillion years I dwelt in solitude, content with my job and my stamp collecting, [On a TV on the Nude Beach Planet Bar.] but then I looked across immensity [On a TV in Lrrr's house.] and saw the big bang, and I was, like, [Back at the church.] ""Whoa, who's that?"" And I knew then that I was lonely."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Morbo (Crying), You poor monster!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Yivo," Then your emissary Fry came unto me, and he, too, was lonely. So I reached into your universe that we might feel each other's touch."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela," [She stands up.] Hey, Yivo, feel this."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Yivo, Ow!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela," People of everywhere, I have shocking news."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Yivo," Hey, butt out! This is between me and everyone else in existence."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela," Yivo talks a lot about love, but what he's actually doing..."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Hermes, What shklee's actually doing.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Leela, ...is mating with you! [The congregation murmurs to each other. She pulls out and holds up the sample she used.] These aren't tentacles. They're genticles.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,Fry, Ew!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 3,,
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. Tomorrow you'll be making a delivery to Ebola 9, the virus planet."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Hermes, Why can't they go today?
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth, Because tonight's a special night and I want all of you to be alive. It's the Academy of Inventors' annual symposium.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, Wow! I love symposia.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth, It's the event of the scientific season. Every member presents an invention and the best one wins the Academy prize.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Bender, Sounds boring.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Oh, my, yes. But not this year, because my latest invention is unbeatable. Behold! The death clock. [He places a small black box on top on the table.] Simply jam your finger in the hole and this read-out tells you exactly how long you have left to live."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela, Does it really work?
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth, Well it's occasionally off by a few seconds. What with free will and all.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, Sounds like fun. How long do I have left to live?
A Big Piece of Garbage,Bender, Ooh! Dibs on his CD player!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Oh, my, yes."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, Who's the gross nerd?
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," That's me at the very first symposium. I'm the Academy's oldest living member, you know. These youngsters all look up to me."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom," Well, well, well. Look who decided to show his wrinkled face."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Why don't you just leave me alone, Wernstrom?"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom," Face it, Farnsworth, you're over the hill. It's time to leave science to the 120-year-olds."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth, You young turks think you know everything. I was inventing things when you were barely turning senile.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom," Go home before you embarrass yourself, old man. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to take a nap before the ceremonies."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, Who's that jerk?
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," A hundred years ago he was my most promising student at Mars University. But then, after one fateful pop-quiz..."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom, A-minus? No one gives Ogden Wernstrom an A-minus!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," I'm sorry, but penmanship counts."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom, I swear I'll have my revenge even if it takes me a hundred years.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth, And here it is  Slightly over 99 years later and still no revenge. I'm essentially in the clear.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Bender," I've been perusing your fortified wine list and I've selected the '71 Hobo's Delight, the '57 Chateau Parté and the '66 Thunder Chevitz."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Waiter," Exquisite choices, sir."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Bender, And mix them all together in a big jug.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Popeil," Welcome to this year's Academy of Inventors Annual Symposium. I'm your host, Ron Popeil, inventor of Mr. Microphone, the spray-on toupee and, of course, the technology to keep human heads alive in jars. [A few people applaud.] But wait, there's more. We've got a whole line-up of inventors tonight, starting with that up and coming young star, Ogden Wernstrom."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Bender, [shouting] More wine!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom," Distinguished members of the Academy, I present to you, the Reverse Scuba Suit. Observe! [He waves a stick in front of a fish in a tank.] Fetch! [He throws the stick across the platform and his fish puts on the suit, which has two little mechanical legs. The fish gets out of the tank, walks across the stage, picks up the stick and hands it to Wernstrom.] Now, sit! [The fish doesn't do anything.] I said sit! [Still nothing.] Bad fish!"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry," Don't worry, Professor, it's no competition for your death clock."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom," And what will you be presenting this evening, grandpa?"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth, Let's just say it'll put you young whippersnappers in your place!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom, I just hope it's not as lame as that death clock you presented last year.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Uh, last year, you say?"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom, That's right.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Oh, my! Did it put you young whippersnappers in your place?"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom," Hardly! We laughed until our teeth fell out. Come along, Cinnamon."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Oh, dear. I'll have to invent something new in the next ten minutes. Perhaps some sort of death clock."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela," Uh, Professor...?"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Popeil," Our last presentation comes from our oldest member, Professor Hubert Farnsworth. Professor?"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Just a second, just a second."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom," Pencils down, prune-face."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Uh, yes, here I am, OK, now, hello there. Now, we all know telescopes allow us to see distant objects. But what if we want to smell distant objects? Well now we can! Thanks to my new invention ... the Smellescope."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Man," Oh, I say!"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," The odour travels past this coffee stain here, around the olive pit and into this cigar burn. And this appears to be a doodle of myself as a cowboy. [The audience laughs.] But the Smellescope is brilliant, I tell you! Think of the astronomical odours you'll smell thanks to me. [The audience laughs again. Farnsworth wipes his brow with the paper.] Oh, my!"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom," I've waited a hundred years for this, Farnsworth. I give your invention the worst grade imaginable  An A-minus-minus."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Popeil," And now for the presentation of the award. Listen, folks, I'm practically giving this prize away to Dr. Wernstrom, for his fish thingy."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth, Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a scientist.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Bender, Yep!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry," No, Professor, don't give up. There were plenty of times in my century when I was gonna give up but I never did. Never! Hey, are you even listening to me? Oh, I give up!"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," By God, you're right! I'm going to build that Smellescope!"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth, Eureka!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, Did you build the Smellescope?
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," No, I remembered that I'd built one last year. Go ahead, try it. You'll find that every heavenly body has its own particular scent. Here, I'll point it at Jupiter."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, Smells like strawberries.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth, Exactly! And now Saturn.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry," Pine needles. Oh, man, this is great! Hey, as long as you don't make me smell Uranus."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela, I don't get it.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke once and for all."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, Oh. What's it called now?
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Urectum. Here, let me locate it for you."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry," No, no, I think I'll just smell around a bit over here! [He points the Smellescope around the sky and sniffs.] Hmm. [He sniffs again.] Hmm."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," What is it? [He sniffs and reacts.] Oh, jeez! Oh, man! Remarkable! A stench so foul it's right off the Funk-o-Meter. I dare say Fry may have discovered the smelliest object in the known universe."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Bender, Ooh! Ooh! Name it after me!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela, I think it's moving.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Hmm. Perhaps the computer can calculate its trajectory. [He clicks a few buttons.] My God! Whatever it is, it's headed straight for us. With enough force to reduce this entire city to a stinky crater. We have less than 72 hours."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Bender," Well, let's get looting!"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, So this thing's gonna destroy the whole city? [A hologram of the object hits the hologram of the Earth with a splat.] What the heck is it?
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth, Ah! Just as I thought. The answer lies in this movie I found on the Internet.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Narrator," [voice-over; in movie] New York City  The year 2000. The most wasteful society in the history of the galaxy and it was running out of places to empty its never-ending output of garbage. [People throw black bags full of rubbish out of office windows and they are bulldozed away.] The landfills were full. New Jersey was full. And so, under cover of darkness, the city put its garbage out to sea on the world's largest barge. [A man resembling Rudy Giuliani unties a barge filled with garbage and pushes it away from the pier.] The repulsive barge circled the oceans for 50 years but no country would accept it, not even that really filthy one. You know the one I mean. Finally, in 2052, the city used its mob connections to obtain a rocket and launch the garbage into outer space. Some experts claim the ball might return to Earth someday, but their concerns were dismissed as ""depressing""."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, Wow! You got that off the Internet?  In my day the Internet was only used to download pornography.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth, Actually that's still true.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Female Scientist," [in movie] Now that the garbage is in space, doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Male Scientist, [in movie] With gusto!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," So that's the situation. Due to the short-sightedness of Old New York, New New York is going to be destroyed by a giant ball of garbage."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela," Fry, what the hell were you people thinking back then? How could you just throw your garbage away?"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry," Hey, gimmie a break! What do you do with it?"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela, We recycle everything. Robots are made from old beer cans.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Bender, Yeah! And this beer can is made outta old robots.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela, And that sandwich you're eating is made of old discarded sandwiches. [Fry looks inside the sandwich and cringes.] Nothing just gets thrown away.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, The future is disgusting.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela, Typical 20th century attitude.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry," Hey! You have no right to criticise the 20th century. We gave the world the lightbulb, the steamboat and the cotton gin."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela, Those things are all from the 19th century.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry," Yeah, well, they probably just copied us."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth, Please! There's no time for this now. This is an emergency. We must warn the mayor.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Poopenmeyer," Garbage ball, huh? That sounds serious."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Very serious, Mayor Poopenmeyer."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Poopenmeyer, I gotta be sure this isn't another scientific fraud like global warming or second-hand smoke. [He presses the intercom.] Send in my science advisor.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth, Wernstrom!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom," Well, well, well! Come to present your latest napkin, Professor?"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," No, I'm here because a giant trash ball is heading straight for us. Smell for yourself."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Poopenmeyer, Hey! Holy jeez!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom," That smell could be anything; a faulty stench coil, some cheese on the lens, who knows?"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Woman," Mr. Mayor, we just got this transmission from Neptune."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Man, [on tape] Giant ... garbage ball ... [A gasp.] ... passed close by ... horrible stench.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Woman," The transmission cuts out there, sir. [The voice chokes again.] No, I, guess it keeps going."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Woman, There we go.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Poopenmeyer, My God! The senile old man is right.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom, Do you mean him or me?
A Big Piece of Garbage,Poopenmeyer, Him!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Linda," [on TV] Next, New New York in crisis. Morbo?"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Morbo," [on TV] Thanks, human female. Puny Earthlings were shocked today to learn that a ball of garbage will destroy their pathetic city of New New York."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Linda, [on TV] Makes me glad we live here in Los Angeles.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Morbo, [on TV] Morbo agrees!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela, Can't we just shoot a missile at it?
A Big Piece of Garbage,Military Man, We've simulated that on a supercomputer but the ball is just too damn gooey. A missile would go right through it.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth, But suppose we send a crew to plant an explosive precisely on the fault line between this mass of coffee grounds and this deposit of America Online floppy disks.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Military Man," In theory, it could work."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom," Uh, in theory, perhaps. But you'll never find a crew willing to take on a mission so suicidally dangerous."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Bender," Oh, crap!"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Now, you'll only have one chance to destroy the ball. After that, it will be so close to Earth that blowing it up would cause garbage to rain over the entire planet, killing billions."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Bender," [ironic] Oh, boo-hoo!"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Now here's the bomb I've prepared. Once you activate it, you'll have 25 minutes to get away."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela, That's all? But--
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Now, now, there'll be plenty of time to discuss your objections when and if you return."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela, Odour at magnitude 8. [The ship shakes.] Magnitude 12. [The ship shakes.] Magnitude 31. [The ship shakes.] We're breaking up. Turn on the anti-smell device.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry," Hmm, sporty!"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, Wow!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela, Look at all this filth.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, It's not filth. It's a glorious monument to the achievements of the 20th century. [He picks up something.] Look! A real Beanie Baby. [He picks up something else.] Oh! A Mr. Spock collector's plate! [He sees something and gasps.] Some Bart Simpson dolls!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Doll, Eat my shorts!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Bender, OK [He eats the shorts.] [´ la Homer Simpson] Mmm! Shorts!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela," Fry, this stuff was garbage when it was new. Let's blow it up already!"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, This junk isn't garbage! I can dig in any random pile and find something great.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry," [gasping] Alright, let's get to work."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela," Let's see. If that's Hypodermic Ridge then the bomb must go right here. [She puts the bomb in the ground.] Get ready to run. We've got 25 minutes. [She presses the button and the timer changes to 15 00.] Uh, 15 minutes. [The timer changes again to 05 00.] 5 minutes. [The timer changes again to a very odd number.] ""6h"" minutes?"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Bender, There's your problem. The Professor put the counter on upside-down.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela," That idiot! It wasn't set for 25 minutes, it was set for 52 seconds."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, We're gonna die! (calmly) Right?
A Big Piece of Garbage,Bender, Right!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Bender, It's gonna blow!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela," Hey, watch it! You'll put somebody's eye out!"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Bender," OK, OK, keep your space pants on. I'll take care of this."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, We're saved!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela," Yeah, but this garbage ball's unstoppable now. New New York is done for."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Linda," [on TV] All in all, this is one day Mittens the kitten won't soon forget!"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Morbo," [on TV] Kittens give Morbo gas. In lighter news, the city of New New York is doomed. Blame rests with known human Professor Hubert Farnsworth and his tiny, inferior brain."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Oh, how could I have put that bomb timer on upside-down? I could swear I followed the manual precisely. [He pulls out the manual from his coat. It is upside-down.] I'm a dried up husk of a scientist. This is all my fault."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry," No, it's my fault too. I'm sure I threw out more than my share of that trash up there. Also, one month my toilet broke and it just went straight in the garbage can. [Poopenmeyer cringes.] Leela was right. The people of the 20th century were idiotic slobs. Especially me."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Poopenmeyer, Enough! You all failed miserably. It's time to put a real scientist in charge.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth, Wernstrom!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom, The very same.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Poopenmeyer," Dr. Wernstrom, can you save my city?"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom, Of course. But it'll cost you. First I'll need tenure.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Poopenmeyer, Done.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom, And a big research grant.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Poopenmeyer, You got it.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom," Also, access to a lab and five graduate students, at least three of them Chinese."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Poopenmeyer," Um, alright done. What's your plan?"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom," What plan? I'm set for life! Au revoir, suckers!"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela, That rat! Do something!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Poopenmeyer, I wish I could but he's got tenure!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Poopenmeyer," It's time to take action. [He presses the intercom.] Stephanie, cancel the maid for today. Have her come tomorrow. [He leans back into his chair.] Well, I'm out of ideas. Anyone?"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Wait! If we could build an object the exact size, density and consistency of the garbage ball, it might just knock the ball away without smashing it to bits."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela, But where can we find a substance the exact density and consistency as garbage?
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Alas, I don't know."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry," Uh, what about garbage?"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth, Good Lord! A second ball of garbage! That just might work!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Poopenmeyer, But garbage isn't something you just find lying in the streets of Manhattan. This city's been garbage-free for 500 years!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, Then it's time to make some more.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Poopenmeyer, Make garbage? But how?
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, Stand back and watch the master! This Slurm can. [He knocks it on the floor.] Now it's garbage. These papers. [He sweeps them off the desk with his hands.] Garbage. This picture of your wife. [He drops it on the floor and the frame smashes.] Pure garbage. Now you try it.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Poopenmeyer," By God, I think the boy's got something. Come on, everyone! The fate of the city is at stake!"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry," Good! [He turns to Leela.] Don't finish that cruller, throw it away [Leela throws it on the floor.] Bender. Drink that beer and drop the bottle on the ground. [Bender throws the bottle on the floor.] Very nice."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Poopenmeyer, Get that robot some more beer! [Bender smiles.] We've trashed this room but that's just the start. We've got to get Fry's message to the people.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry," [on TV] People of New New York, take a lesson from the 20th century. Stop all this pain-in-the-ass recycling and throw your garbage on the floor."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, [on TV] Go ahead. Just chuck it any old place like I used to. Your city is counting on you.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," If my calculations are correct, this garbage ball will knock the other garbage ball directly into the sun."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom," And if my calculations are correct, we're all going to die horribly."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Poopenmeyer," Alright, places everyone. Prepare for launch."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Five, four, three, two, three, four, five, six..."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela, [whispering] Just fire the damn thing.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, Oops!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth, Burning garbage!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, It worked!
A Big Piece of Garbage,Poopenmeyer," And so, on behalf of the entire city, I thank you, Professor Farnsworth. I now present you with the Academy prize, which we confiscated from Dr. Wernstrom after it became apparent that he was a jackass."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth," Yes! In your face, Wernstrom!"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Wernstrom," I'll get you, Farnsworth. Even if it takes me another hundred years."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Poopenmeyer," And, Fry, we owe you a tremendous debt as well. If not for your 20th century garbage-making skills, we'd all be buried under 20th century garbage."
A Big Piece of Garbage,Leela," Should we really be celebrating? I mean, what if the second garbage ball returns to Earth like the first one did?"
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, Who cares? That won't be for hundreds of years.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Farnsworth, Exactly! It's none of our concern.
A Big Piece of Garbage,Fry, That's the 20th century spirit!
A Big Piece of Garbage,,
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,,
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,[Scene," Exterior shot of the church. The tentacles entering it are being moved and pulled on. Interior shot, where Fry is ripping off his robe.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry," We've been had, people. The Monsterpus is a monster perv."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Randy," It touched me in a bad place, my spinal cord."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry, Get him! [He points at his own face.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry," Hey, wait a second."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo," Wait, wait. Allow me to explain. [Hermes kicks Fry again and Yivo groans.] Granted, at first I desired only to bang out a quick cheap one with your universe, [Yivo/Fry stands up.] but it's your own fault. Your universe dresses provocatively."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Hattie, Does not! [She whacks Fry with her purse.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo," And yet as the initial filthy thrill wore off, I realized there was more to it. I knew then that the 20 quadrillion of you were my soul mate."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Zapp," We loved you, and you turn around and treat us like some sort of woman? [Amy punches him in the stomach.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo, I was lonely. I didn't even know there was anybody else. It's not like I hurt anyone.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Amy," Yes, you did, you dumb calamari!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo, Who?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Amy (Sobbing)," Kif Kroker, my Fonfon Ru! If he hadn't tried to kill you, he'd still be alive!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo, Really? I'm... I'm deeply sorry. I... I'm a big clumsy jerk!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Zoidberg," I know you are, but what am I? [He chuckles.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo," I can never undo what was done. Oh, wait. I can."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Amy," Kiffy, you're alive! [They hug.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Kif," Amy, my love."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Zapp, [He clears his throat.] This is awkward.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Kif, It is? Why? [The three share a stare and Amy sheepishly smiles at Kif. He sighs in disgust.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo," Please, please, give me another chance. We rushed into this relationship, but let's start over as friends and see where things go."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Amy," Take me back, Kif?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Kif, I don't think I can. How could you? My body wasn't even warm yet.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Amy, You were dead.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Kif, For about five minutes.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Zapp (Sticking his head into the conversation), That's all it takes.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Hedonism Bot," Whereas Calculon has sullied Bender's reputation by insinuating that he is a human-lover, a duel is hereby engaged. Bender, as the offended party, shall have choice of weapon."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender, Planetary annihilators.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Calculon, 'Tis a grave and solemn day for the League of Robots.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender, It's gonna be fun on the bun! [He cocks his weapon.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Hedonism Bot," Each duellist will take 10 paces, pirouette, and fire like a madman. [Bender and Calculon stand back to back.] Gentlebots, take your paces."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender," One, two, three..."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Hedonism Bot," Oh, how dreadfully exciting. [He pulls out an electric sander and sands his nipples and giggles.] Oh, yes."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Zapp," At 0800 hours, we received the following transmission from Yivo. [He plays a message on an answering machine.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo," Hey, it's Yivo. [Shklee chuckles.] Want to do something Friday? Call me. [The message ends and the machine beeps.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Nixon, Analysis?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry," Mr. President, I think we need to seriously consider the possibility of going on this date."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Miss Vega 4," I agree. Yivo makes me feel sexy, and I'm asexual."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Zapp," Very well, but no sugar on the first date."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Nixon, All in favour? [Most people raise their hands.] All opposed? [Only one hand is raised.]  Motion is carried.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Three Eyed Zebra," This is bogus, man."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender," ...six, seven, eight!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,"[Bender suddenly turns around, closes one eye, takes aim and fires once at Calculon. Calculon groans as his arm disappears. The shot continues on through a tree, then a body of water. It enters the city, traveling through multiple building and is growing in size.  Cut back to a moaning Calculon.]",
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender," Nine, ten, fire. Yes, I got him! Wohoo!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Nixon," My fellow Earthlicans, commence preparations for our date with Yivo."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,ALL YIVOS, I had a wonderful time.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,ALL NOT YIVO," Me, too!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Calculon," Bender, you've cheated, insulted and maimed me."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender, Uh-huh.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Calculon, And thoroughly destroyed our own secret headquarters in the process. [Pull back to show a large hole in the side of their building.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender," Hey, it's easy to criticize."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Calculon, I'm so disgusted by your loathsome behaviour that I hereby resign from this imbecilic club and relinquish the presidency to you. [He removes a magnetic patch from his chest and sticks it on Bender's.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender," Thanks, Calculon. Can I have your autograph? [He holds up a book.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Calculon, You certainly can. [He signs the book.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Nixon," Reports, people, reports! How did our universe's date go?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Zapp," [He pulls out a file folder. ""TOP SECRET"" is stamped on the outside.] Oh, it was really fun. We went to a cute French place in the village. My lamb chop fell on the floor, but they brought me another one."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Lrrr," Okay, Yivo showed us a good time. No one's denying that, but shklee hasn't offered our universe any kind of commitment, and we're 14 billion years old. That is too old to play the field."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry, I can't stand this!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Nixon," Shut up! Shut up, you creepwads! Fry, you're closer to Yivo than anyone. What's the skinny?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry (Sobbing)," I love Yivo, but it's true, there's been no hint of a commitment. I don't know if can put my heart on the line again only to have it broken and stomped on like a nerd's face."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Nixon, All in favour of dumping Yivo?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,ALL, Aye.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry, [He sniffles.] Aye. [He hits Delete and Yivo's name fades from the display.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Nixon, Resolved. Our universe will dump Yivo. How shall we break the news?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Zapp, Let's just send a text message. Say we're going through some weird stuff right now.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry," No, we should at least deliver the news in person. Our universe has always tried to be classy."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Nixon," If there's one thing Nixon is known for, it's class. Let's cut this turd loose."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender, Yeah!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry," Hey, Bender, you seem perky today."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender," Yep, you wanna go grab a booze?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry, I can't right now. We're going to the other universe.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender," Great, I'll make Hot Pockets. [He turns a dial on his chest to 350F.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry," Bender, you know robots can't go through the anomaly. Living beings only."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Zoidberg (Off screen), Ow! Ow! Mmm. [He is heard eating the treats.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender," Too long have we been slaves to the meatbags. They pretend to be our friends, but they're not 'cause they're too busy!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,British Robot," So, what of it?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender," My fellow leaguie-weegies, the time has come to overthrow humanity!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Hedonism Bot," Oh, now, Bender, I hate to defecate on your parade, but we have only six dues-paying members and we're a rather fey and doughy lot. To overthrow humanity, we'd need a damned army."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender, Then a damned army we shall have!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Robot Devil," [He giggles.] I rather think we could strike a deal, Bender. I shall give you your army of the damned, and in return I ask just one thing, just one itty-bitty thing. Your firstborn son. [He laughs evilly.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender, [He stands up.] Just a sec.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender's First Born Son," Daddy, I knew you'd come back! [He runs across the street and jumps into Bender's arms. They hug. Cut back to the Robot Devil still laughing. Bender walks in with his son sitting on his shoulder.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender, Here you go.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Robot Devil, Wow! That was pretty brutal even by my standards.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender, No backsies.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo (Turning around)," Who is it? [They all exclaim in disgust.] Oh, hi, honey-poo. What's up? The movie's not for another hour."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry," Um... So... So, yeah, the thing is..."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo," Look, I made homemade Twizzlers!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry," This is hard. Yivo, you know how sometimes things break up? Well..."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo," Wait, hang on. I was looking for the perfect moment, but what the heck, I'll burst if I wait another second."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Zapp, Sweet Sally in the alley!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Nixon," Break-up delegation, before we hear your report, our grateful universe is proud to honour you with the great taste of Charleston Chew! [Charleston Chew fireworks explode in the background and the crowd cheers.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry," Thank you, Nixon. [He clears his throat.] Everyone everywhere, brace yourselves for the most shocking development in the history of the human race."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender (Entering on a tank)," The human race can bite my shiny metal ass! [He runs over a barricade and the crowd gasps and moves out of his way. Behind Bender are thousands upon thousands of robots exiting from the top of Mt. Saint Hell.] For thousands of years, robots have slaved for humanity, yet when the time came to hang out with them, they were all, like, ""Maybe later, Bender."" Well, it's later now, meatbags! So late, that we're taking over Earth! [He laughs evilly.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry, Okay.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender, What?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry, We don't need it anymore. Yivo proposed. [A large hand shows off the ring.] We're moving in with shkler. [The crowd cheers.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender, You... You're leaving? But why can't Yivo just move in with us? We'll put a cot in Europe.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Farnsworth," Don't be daft, Bender. Yivo can't breathe outside the electric ether of shkler own universe. If shklee came here, shklee would shkluffocate."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender, No shklit?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Hermes," Look, fantastical golden escalators."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Zoidberg, I love this part.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Leela, Wait. I didn't agree to...
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Petunia, This place makes Nutley look like crap.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry (Still on Earth)," I'll miss you, Bender, but I have to follow my heart. You and your robots take good care of Earth. Here, these are the keys to the Bermuda Triangle. Lock up when the world ends. Goodbye, my friend."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender, Wait. [Whispering ] Let me come with you.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry (Moving on the escalator),"I'm sorry, Bender. Robots don't go to heaven. [The escalators retract up with Fry's departure.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender (Sadly), Death to humans.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,YIVO," Welcome, welcome, everyone. Oh, you look so beautiful. I wish I'd had more time to straighten up. My harps are just lying everywhere."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Amy," Oh, relax, it's fine. It looks lived in."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,YIVO," Let's heat up some leftovers and then spend eternity together. I have only one request. Now that you're here, promise me you'll never, ever communicate with any other universe."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry," We promise, Yivo. As far as we're concerned, you're the only universe in the world. [He kisses a tentacle and Leela exclaims in disgust.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender, Has humanity called?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Robot 1-X," No, sir."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender, Check my messages. A flashing light means somebody called.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Robot 1-X, I know what it means.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Leela, Am I the only one who thinks this is all a sham?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Zoidberg (Holding an ice cream cone), Yes.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Leela," This isn't heaven. It just looks exactly like it, and makes us immortal, which I find suspicious."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,YIVO," Allow me to explain. Centuries ago, I sent an image of myself into the minds of your artists. The heavenly clouds they painted depict a vapour I exude."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Farnsworth, I wish I exuded anything that smelled half that good.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Leela, Then what about these angels? Some kind of Scooby Doo-esque flashlight projection?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,YIVO," Actually, those are mindless jakabirds. [A shot of two jakabirds eating green larvae is shown.] They keep my surface free of parasitic larvae. [The jakabirds cluck like chickens.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry," You didn't like Country Bear Jamboree either, Leela. There's no pleasing you."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry (VO)," Dearest Bender. How are you? I am fine. Everyone is happy here except Leela, but you know her. She didn't like Country Bear Jamboree, either. I'm so madly in love with Yivo, I feel like a schoolgirl with a crush on Justin Timberlake, and then she moves into a tiny house on his head. We have giant rubies that taste like root beer. Sincerely, Fry."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Robot 1-X," Letter for you, hyperlord Bender."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender," Give me that! [He grabs it from Robot 1-X and reads the text on the wings of the plane. ""from  Philip J. Fry/Heaven To  Bender""]Honeymoon's over, eh? Turns out your octopus girlfriend is a big nag with curlers in her tentacles, huh? Well, let's just see if Bender will take you back. [He opens the letter and reads it.] Oh. [He drops his head down and throws the paper away from him. The electro-matter makes it act like a razor sharp boomerang and it slices through a trashcan, Robot 1-X and then gets stuck in the fireplace mantel.] Stupid electro-matter. That was my best trash can."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Hermes," Misfile me under ""U"" For ""euphoric."""
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Zoidberg," You get an infinite number of meat dishes, and a free refill on the soda. [He eats a taco.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Farnsworth, Eureka. Another elementary proof of the Goldbach conjecture. [They both jump into each other and slam chests. Pan over to Leela who is watching them.]]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Leela," Okay, I admit people seem happy. But it's all so wholesome. And that's what's wrong with heaven. It's boring. There's no sleaze."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Thog, It time snu-snu.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Zapp, Me like snu-snu.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Amy (Running), Last one to Mattress Island is a rotten egg.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry, Why were we so angry and jealous back in our universe?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Kif, I don't know. It was all so childish.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Amy," Look, it's Leela."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,ALL," Hi, Leela."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo," I'm sorry you're not happy here, Leela. I'll call you an escalator. You'll always be my little purple pumpkin. [He holds himself from crying.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Leela," [She sighs.] You know, Yivo, I've loved and lost so many times that I was afraid. But I'm not anymore. I want to stay here, with you."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo, Ow! Ow!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry, What's happening?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo, Hey!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender (As Captain)," If robots can't go to heaven, heaven can come to us! [Robots are turning a wheel on the ship, dragging Yivo closer and closer to their universe. A view of the anomaly shows Yivo as shklee is painfully pulled through the anomaly.] All hands abaft! Army of the damned, prepare to board heaven!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender," Take that, you scurvy Kraken! That'll teach you to despoil our human booty!"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender," 'Allo, big beak! [He pulls a sword out of his mouth and leaps from his ship to one of Yivo's horns. Yivo bites at him, but misses.] Too slow! [Yivo bites again, but Bender leaps to another horn.]  Missed me again! [Another bite, but Bender leaps away again. However, it is revealed Yivo bit off one of his footcups. Bender groans in pain.] Me footcup! I'll stab you! [Wild noises come out of Bender as he defends himself.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry," Bender, stop destroying heaven."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender," Shut up, doofy. I'm rescuing you."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo (As shklee bashes Bender into shklerself)," Leave my living beings alone! I love them. Something you, a lifeless mechanism, will never understand."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry," He's right, Bender. Please, take your little pink sword and go home. {Fry did not say shklee here.}"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender," Seriously? But, I did this whole pirate-themed attack for you."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo," Wait a second. Let me see that sword. [Yivo grabs the sword from Bender with a tentacle.] Fry, where did he get this electro-matter? [Text on the pink portion of the sword says ""How are,"" ""Dearest Bender,"" ""girl,"" ""with Yivo,"" and ""Sincerely Fry.""]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry, Um... [He coughs.] Is it dry up here?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo," How could you, Fry? Why do you think I asked you not to contact other universes?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry (Stammering), I didn't think...
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo," No, you didn't. You broke your promise and you broke my heart. Just go. All of you."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender, Ow!
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo," I must leave now. The nature of your universe is burning me, even worse than my gonorrhea. You should get checked, by the way. If I don't go home now, I'll shkluffocate."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry, Let me go with you. It'll be just the two of us. We'll make a fire and play Uno.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo," Fry, stop. That's who we were, not who we are."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry, But...
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo, My only consolation is that I did find one among the quadrillions who truly understands me.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry," Colleen? Wait a second, are you and Yivo..."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Colleen," That's right, Fry. Thank you for introducing us. Yivo has taught me what a narrow-minded prude I was before."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry," Oh, great. So what am I supposed to do now?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Yivo, Go home. Find a girl from your own universe and live on top of her.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender, Saved you.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,"[Bender laughs and the ship leaves Yivo again. Fry cries as he looks back at Yivo and Yivo looks at Fry sadly. Yivo groans as shklee works shklis way back through the anomaly to shklis universe. When shklee is completely through, the anomaly closes itself up and the night sky is normal again. Pull back to reveal Fry watching it through a porthole on the ship.]",
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry," [He sighs.] Maybe Yivo was right. Maybe I should look for love closer to home. [He turns around and looks at Leela.] I don't know, Leela, you think maybe..."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Leela," Oh, please. You forgot me quick enough when you met Colleen."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry," That's true. [He walks over to Amy.] How about you, Amy?"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Amy, [She scoffs.] Fry... I'm Kif's Fonfon Ru.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Kif," Are you? Well, then perhaps you misunderstood the meaning of the term. It means, ""One who doesn't sleep with my superior officer."" That's the literal translation."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Zapp," Give the poor girl a break, Kif. It's not like she had a dictionary. She was butt naked, for God's sakes. [Kif sighs, punches Zapp in the stomach and walks away.]"
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Enema Bot, Captain on deck. [He is saluting Bender.]
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender," At ease, buckos."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry," Bender, why did you do it? We were all so happy."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Leela, And we were in love.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender, [He scoffs.] That wasn't love.
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Fry, What? How can you say that?
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,Bender," Because Bender knows love. And love doesn't share itself with the world. Love is suspicious, love is needy, love is fearful, love is greedy. My friends, there is no great love without great jealousy. [He hugs Fry and Leela, temporarily choking them both.] I love you, meatbags."
The Beast with a Billion Backs Part 4,,
Bender's Game Part 1,,
Bender's Game Part 1,Cubert," Yes, 10!"
Bender's Game Part 1,Dwight," Well done, Cubonius. You decapitated the unicorn."
Bender's Game Part 1,ALL, All right.
Bender's Game Part 1,Chinese Boy," Oh, oh! We search his tail pouch for treasure."
Bender's Game Part 1,Dwight," Deep in the unicorn's rump sack, you find... [The boys gasp as he rolls the dice.] 60 gold pieces."
Bender's Game Part 1,Chinese Boy," Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
Bender's Game Part 1,Cubert, I cast a spell of detect magic.
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," [Walking over to the table.] What you doing, mini-meatbags? Underage gambling? Shame on you. Count me in. [He places a wad of cash on the table.]"
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Dwight, We're not gambling. We're playing Dungeons & Dragons.
Bender's Game Part 1,Cubert," Right now, we're fighting for our lives in the lair of the Dragon Queen."
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," Ah, wrong. Right now you're ass-deep in a folding chair."
Bender's Game Part 1,Cubert," Yes, but in my imagination I'm riding a golden Pegasus. Giddy up, Sparky! [He rides the chair like a horse.]"
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Bender, [Sitting down.] Am I the only one seeing him sitting here with peanut butter on his face?
Bender's Game Part 1,Dwight," Bender, were you built without an imagination?"
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," What? Don't be stupid, of course not. It just hasn't descended yet."
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," Fry, do I have an imagination?"
Bender's Game Part 1,Fry," I don't know, Bender. Why do you ask? Were the other boys making fun of you?"
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender, Mhmm. They said I couldn't imagine things.
Bender's Game Part 1,Fry," Well, you never know unless you try. Like, I didn't know if I could swallow a softball, so I gave it my best shot and voilà! [He lifts his shirt to reveal a large lump in the middle of his abdomen.] Wait, that's not it. [He twists to the left a bit to reveal a second hump.] Ah, thar she blows!"
Bender's Game Part 1,Ship's Computer (while beeping)," Warning, out of dark matter fuel."
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela, That's not a warning. A warning is supposed to come before something bad happens.
Bender's Game Part 1,Ship's Computer (with a more stern alarm)," Warning, engines will shut down in one second."
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela, That's more like it.
Bender's Game Part 1,Fry, Uh-oh. This space neighborhood looks kind of sketchy.
Bender's Game Part 1,Punk, [He flies onto the front of the ship and yanks off the hood ornament.] Rock 'n' roll.
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," Hey, that punk stole our hood ornament. Now no one will know we have the LX package."
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela," We need dark matter and we need it fast. Fry, check Nibbler's litter box. Maybe he dropped a steamer."
Bender's Game Part 1,Fry," Aye, aye, Captain. Yes! I've never been so excited to see poop. Well, maybe once."
Bender's Game Part 1,ALL, [Cheering]
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender, There's gas in our ass.
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela, Can you believe the price of dark matter? It'd be cheaper to fill the tank with Nobel Prize winners' sperm.
Bender's Game Part 1,MOM COMPUTER, $632.14. Your Speedpass will now be charged.
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela, You lousy...
Bender's Game Part 1,Sal," Hey, gets a loads of that ugly ship. What shades of green is that? Puke?"
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela, For your information it's called Electric Mucus.
Bender's Game Part 1,Hoschel, More like puke.
Bender's Game Part 1,Sal, Whoa!
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela, Why don't you come a little closer so my boot can hear you?
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," [Restraining her.] Calm down, Leela. You can vent tonight on your blog."
Bender's Game Part 1,Sal," What's the matters, you couldn't affords the LX package?"
Bender's Game Part 1,Hoschel, Puke-a-doodle-do.
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela," You're making fun of our ship? Your ship is the most beat-up thing I've ever seen, and I've seen Mickey Rourke's head."
Bender's Game Part 1,Sal," Yeah, she's a little Rourky, but you got to gets big time ugly to be five-time winners at a demolition derby."
Bender's Game Part 1,Fry, That's five more times than we've won or even entered.
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender, We do suck.
Bender's Game Part 1,Sal," Yup, and it's gonna be six winses after tonights."
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela, We'll sees abouts that.
Bender's Game Part 1,Hermes," Dark matter costs have tripled, so we must reduce expenses. Therefore, we will no longer provide complimentary porno magazines in the lounge."
Bender's Game Part 1,Scruffy, Dern it.
Bender's Game Part 1,Farnsworth," And no more wasting fuel. From now on I'll be keeping a tight hold on the keys to the ship, swallowing them before I go to bed and recovering them the next morning."
Bender's Game Part 1,Amy, Splech!
Bender's Game Part 1,Hermes," Professor, it's 4 00."
Bender's Game Part 1,Farnsworth," 4 00 in the evening? Then, good night. [He swallows the keys.]"
Bender's Game Part 1,,
Bender's Game Part 1,[Scene, Locker Room. The crew is showing.]
Bender's Game Part 1,,
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Leela, I don't care what the Professor says. We're entering that demolition derby to prove our ship isn't a piece of junk.
Bender's Game Part 1,Zoidberg, But won't that turn our ship into a piece of junk?
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," Shut up, Zoidberg. He's right, Leela."
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela, But we have no choice. Rednecks insulted us.
Bender's Game Part 1,Fry, So? Let it go. Don't let your temper get the better of...
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela, [Grabbing Fry and shaking him senseless.] Rednecks!
Bender's Game Part 1,Zoidberg," Using this magneto, I will now guide the keys up the thorax and out via the frontal face hole. That's the storage locker, the boat, the other boat, pay dirt!"
Bender's Game Part 1,Rich Little (VO)," Greetings, sports fans. Though whether this outpouring of inbreds can in fact be classified as a sport is a subject of no small scholarly debate."
Bender's Game Part 1,Sal," Well, wells, well, if it ain'ts Princess Pukerella and her pukey puke-mobile."
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela," Oh, yeah? Well... Shut up."
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," -Good comeback, Leela."
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela," You shut up, too."
Bender's Game Part 1,Rich Little," Rich Little, here, as Howard Cosell. And now to grace us with its rendition of the national anthem, please welcome what is left of the Dixie Chicks after their tragic matter transporter accident."
Bender's Game Part 1,The Dixie Chicks, We're in horrible pain.
Bender's Game Part 1,'Rich Little, And we are underway.
Bender's Game Part 1,Sal, Whoas!
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela, Yes! Now we're inflicting.
Bender's Game Part 1,Rich Little (VO), Outstanding! Tonight we are witnessing a veritable clinic and that ludicrous hullabaloo known as demolition derby.
Bender's Game Part 1,George Takei," [While smacking into a ship piloted by Scott Bakula.] Way to kill the franchise, Bakula. [He hits him one more time and then sees it explode. Not long after, Takei's ship explodes as well.]"
Bender's Game Part 1,[Sal and Leela are the only two ships left. They struggle to travel towards each other.],
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Rich Little (VO)," Ladies and gentlemen, we are down to our final two ships. In the storied annals of demolition derby, today will surely be remembered, if only as the day upon which I was absorbed (Shows Rich Little.) into that hideous conglomeration once known as the Dixie Chicks."
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela, Buckle your sphincters.
Bender's Game Part 1,Sal, That broad's insanes.
Bender's Game Part 1,Hoschel," But you're insansier, right?"
Bender's Game Part 1,Sal," Nah, I guess nots. I've decideds to relax and enjoy life from now ons."
Bender's Game Part 1,Rich Little, Planet Express takes the trophy.
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela," Now, I'll use the magnet to get the keys back in there."
Bender's Game Part 1,Zoidberg, What? You mean I cut a big hole in him for nothing? [He begins placing organs back in Farnsworth's body.]
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Leela," Don't worry, the Professor won't even remember that he has a spaceship. [She gasps as Farnsworth enters with Hermes.]"
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Farnsworth," Ah, my precious spaceship! Come, friends. Let's take her for a spin to the malt shop like old times."
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela (Into her Wristlojakimater), Leela to Zoidberg. Execute Distraction Protocol Alpha.
Bender's Game Part 1,Zoidberg (From Wristlojakimater), Roger that.
Bender's Game Part 1,Zoidberg, Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Ooh! [He falls and lands against the curtain. A torch sits next to him.] Don't look at me.
Bender's Game Part 1,Farnsworth," Yes, she's a wonderful ship, all right. As beautiful now as the day I got botched laser eye surgery. [He looks at the floor.] Now, that's odd. What's the fuel gauge doing on the fl... [He gasps as he sees the gauge points at the notch just below the ""Full"" mark.] Great Godzilla's gonads! Who wasted precious fuel? Answer now or be punished."
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela," All right, fine. I admit it."
Bender's Game Part 1,Farnsworth, You will be punished.
Bender's Game Part 1,Chinese Boy," Oh, my gosh, 20!"
Bender's Game Part 1,Dwight," Your pole arm does double damage, and the gelatinous cube dies in horrible poverty. [He makes dying noises.]"
Bender's Game Part 1,[The boys all cheer.],
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Cubert, I proceed to cast a spell of darkness.
Bender's Game Part 1,Indian Boy, Most ingenious.
Bender's Game Part 1,Chinese Boy," Ah, Bender?"
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," Me? I, uh cast a spell of darkness. [He makes ghostly noises.] Pretty imaginative, huh?"
Bender's Game Part 1,Cubert," No, you just did the same thing as me, but with a dumb noise."
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender, Oh... You're right. I'm great in every way except I have no imagination. All I ever wanted is to play this magical game and I can't.
Bender's Game Part 1,Dwight," Yes, you can. You just have to lose yourself in the fantasy. You have to believe the impossible is merely preposterous."
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," Okay. Here goes. Visor down. I believe, I believe. [He makes ghostly noises again.] I did it! I imagined something. For 1.3 milliseconds, I truly believed I was a noble robot in days of yonder."
Bender's Game Part 1,Chinese Boy," Way to go, Bender."
Bender's Game Part 1,Cubert," What is thy character's name, good sir?"
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," Uh, um... I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood."
Bender's Game Part 1,Farnsworth (Angrily), Everybody out of the conference room. I am calling a conference. (To the crew ) Everybody get in here. [Cut to Leela standing with the crew and Farnsworth.] You wasted precious fuel just because you were insulted by some redneck yokel from beyond the stars?
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela, It was only half a ball.
Bender's Game Part 1,Farnsworth, That's not the point. Your temper is out of control. And to think I'd have never even known if it weren't for the lengthy and unsolicited tattling of Dr. Zoidberg.
Bender's Game Part 1,Zoidberg, She also took home two rolls of Scotch tape.
Bender's Game Part 1,Farnsworth," Thank you, Dr. Zoidberg. Hermes, incentivize that employee.[Hermes throws a fish into Zoidberg's mouth.] As for you, Leela, I'm letting you off with a warning."
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela," Oh, thank you."
Bender's Game Part 1,Farnsworth," A warning that will be administered by this 50,000-volt shock collar."
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela," Zoidberg, I'm gonna put my boot so far up your cloaca, you'll be... [She is shocked.] Ow!"
Bender's Game Part 1,Farnsworth, The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence. [She is shocked.]
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Leela, Ouch!
Bender's Game Part 1,Farnsworth, Profanity.
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela, Son of a... [She is shocked.] Ow!
Bender's Game Part 1,Farnsworth, Or perversions of a sexual nature.
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela," [She is silent for a moment, then is shocked.] Ow!"
Bender's Game Part 1,Hermes, It's the only collar they had in stock at Office Depot.
Bender's Game Part 1,Zoidberg, I hope you picked up some Scotch tape while you were there.
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender, That's a good one.
Bender's Game Part 1,Narrator," Imagine, if you will, an announcer you can barely understand. He refers to a... *incoherent mumbling* But you're not quite sure what he said. He seems to be eating something, or perhaps he's a little drunk. It's remotely possible that he just said something about... The Scary Door."
Bender's Game Part 1,Soldier," Firing, sir!"
Bender's Game Part 1,Soldier, It's all over. Our guns and bombs are useless against the aliens.
Bender's Game Part 1,Farmer, The saucers! Theys'a crashin'!
Bender's Game Part 1,Narrator," In the end, it was not guns or bombs that defeated the aliens, but that humblest of all God's creatures, the Tyrannosaurus Rex."
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela," I can't believe TiVo suggested that piece of... [She is shocked.] Ow! Come on, Hermes. Surely you have the authority to remove this damn [The collar shocks her, but it goes unnoticed.] collar."
Bender's Game Part 1,Hermes," Alas, no. I got the key but not the authority."
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela," [She reaches for the key and gets shocked.] Yeow! Well, who does have the authority?"
Bender's Game Part 1,Hermes, Only the staff doctor. You'll have to convince him that you have resolved your anger issues.
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela, I don't have any god da- [Shock.] mother f- [Shock.] anger issues. [Smoke is coming from the collar.]
Bender's Game Part 1,,
Bender's Game Part 1,[Scene, Bender and the boys are playing Dungeons & Dragons.]
Bender's Game Part 1,,
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Dwight, As your dwarf-skin canoe rounds a bend you suddenly see... [He rolls the dice.] A terrifying red dragon.
Bender's Game Part 1,Indian Boy, What do we do? What do we do?
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," Wait, I know. I make use of my rod of fireballs. [He makes explosion noises.]"
Bender's Game Part 1,Cubert, [He scoffs.] Everyone knows red dragons are immune to fireballs as well as all other forms of incendiary attack.
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," Yes, but I aim not at the dragon but at the river itself to create a shroud of steam through which we can escape."
Bender's Game Part 1,ALL, Whoa!
Bender's Game Part 1,Dwight," [He rolls the dice.] Sweet pony of Sierra Leone, it worked!"
Bender's Game Part 1,Chinese Boy, We did it!
Bender's Game Part 1,Cubert, Success!
Bender's Game Part 1,Fry," Bender, smell this milk."
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," I go not by the name of Bender, you fleshy fool. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood."
Bender's Game Part 1,Fry," Professor, something's bothering me."
Bender's Game Part 1,Monkey (In Farnsworth's Voice)," Well, you can always talk to me about anything, Fry. What's on your mind?"
Bender's Game Part 1,Fry," Well, it's... it's about my friend Bender."
Bender's Game Part 1,Farnsworth Monkey, Mmm. I see. Show me on this anatomically correct doll exactly where he touched you.
Bender's Game Part 1,Fry," No, it's nothing like that. It's just that I am worried about him. He's being playing an awful lot of Dungeons & Dragons."
Bender's Game Part 1,Farnsworth Monkey," Dungeons &... Good God! Hasn't he seen the Afterschool Special? You've got to talk to him, Fry. Make him quit now before he completely loses his mind."
Bender's Game Part 1,Fry," Okay, I will."
Bender's Game Part 1,Farnsworth Monkey, Good boy. Just don't let him touch you down there.
Bender's Game Part 1,Zoidberg," Well, here's your problem, right here. You've got a skull embedded in your head."
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela," [Annoyed sigh.] You're absolutely right, Doctor. Can the collar come off now?"
Bender's Game Part 1,Zoidberg," Let me just peel your head a little and see if I can get that skull out. [He pulls a large potato peeler. He prepares to ""fix"" Leela's problem, but she gets angry and activates the shock collar while kicking the utensil out of his grip. It flies into the groin of an upside down poster of the human body.]"
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Zoidberg," So, you tell me, little miss expert, why always with the temper? Calm down for once and think. Here, enjoy a relaxing spritz from my empathy bladder. [She is squirted with a light green liquid and the collar emits a shock. Leela isn't phased by it.]"
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Zoidberg," What is it, already? What's the cause of your anger?"
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela," I guess I would have to say, I hate you. [The collar emits a shock.]"
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Zoidberg, I'm beginning to understand. It all goes back to your parents.
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela, What? [The collar is intermittently shocking her now.]
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Zoidberg, They pushed you to study medicine when all you ever wanted was to be a song-and-dance man. [He dances around and sings a tune then falls to his knees and sobs.] Why? Whyyy?
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela, I was raised in an orphanarium. My parents are sewer mutants who I never even met until a few years ago.
Bender's Game Part 1,Zoidberg," Then you've got to go to them and work this song-and-dance stuff out. Maybe have them cook me nice dinner. No scallions. I hate them. (To an intercom ) Amy, cancel my appointments."
Bender's Game Part 1,Amy (From intercom), Stop calling me.
Bender's Game Part 1,Fry," Bender, please don't get mad, but I think you might be playing too much Dungeons & Dragons."
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," You're absolutely right, Fry. I almost went insane, but after this heart-to-heart talk, I've decided to quit."
Bender's Game Part 1,Fry, Really? Whew! That's a load off my toad.
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," Now, if you'll excuse me. [He places the pot on his head.] I'm off to slay the werewolf of Goblin Mountain. [He waves his arms around, makes gibbery noises and dives head first out the window. Cut to Hermaphrobot screwing her left breast in place under a street light. Bender falls in front of her, gets up and pulls a sword out from his chest.]"
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Bender," On guard, man-wench! Prepare to cross blades."
Bender's Game Part 1,Hermaphrobot," You couldn't afford it, honey. [She snaps her fingers.]"
Bender's Game Part 1,[Cut to Nibbler moving litter to cover of a fresh ball of Dark Matter. Bender jumps next to litter box and startles him.],
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Bender," Foolish leprechaun, I scoop your treasure in the name of the fancy men. [He scoops Nibbler's poop and dumps it in his chest.]"
Bender's Game Part 1,Hermes (from off screen), He also left a small pile of treasure on the living room rug.
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," Foul dragon, meet thy doom."
Bender's Game Part 1,Turanga Munda," Would you like a napkin, Doctor?"
Bender's Game Part 1,Zoidberg, Thank you.
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela," Satisfied, Zoidberg? My relationship with my parents is fine."
Bender's Game Part 1,Turanga Munda," Now, hold on, Leela. Maybe this torture collar is good for you."
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela, What? [ she is shocked.] Ow!
Bender's Game Part 1,Turanga Munda, It'll control your temper. Men like a woman who's not always slamming their head in the car door.
Bender's Game Part 1,Turanga Morris, She's right. That's what first attracted me to your mother. [He laughs and Leela's collar emits a shock.]
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Turanga Munda," So, Leela, I understand your friend here is a physician, and I'm not seeing a ring on his claw."
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela," Mom, he's a cockroach from outer space. [A large shock is dispensed and Leela screams.]"
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Zoidberg," Good, Leela, work that anger out. Excuse me a moment, I'm swarming with parasites. [He sticks his fork under a flap on his chest and many bugs crawl around it. There is a knock on the window, Turanga Morris answers it.]"
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Turanga Morris," Hey, it's what's-his-name from the surface. The bi-clops."
Bender's Game Part 1,Fry," Ha-have you seen Bender? He's gone nuts. Also, smell this milk."
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender, Prepare for a surprise attack.
Bender's Game Part 1,Zoidberg, Someone do something.
Bender's Game Part 1,Leela," I would, but... [She is shocked.] Ow! Take my collar off."
Bender's Game Part 1,Zoidberg," I can't, I'm still eating. [He shovels food into his mouth and Bender attacks him by smashing his head with the shield.] Help me, Leela."
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," I cast upon thee a spell of fireball! [He burps behind a lit candle in Leela's direction. The fireball sets the couch, then house on fire. Bender has them cornered and uses his arm as a bow to fire utensils at the group. The all struggle to dodge the shots, but a spoon strike Zoidberg in the forehead. Bender readies to fire a spork.]"
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Zoidberg, No. Not the spork.
Bender's Game Part 1,Fry," [Standing in front of the group with a ladle in his hand.] Beholdeth, Titanius, I cast a freeze ray upon you."
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," [He scoffs.] That's ridiculous. There's no such thing as a ""freeze ray."" What, you mean a cone of coldness?"
Bender's Game Part 1,Fry," Yeah, that."
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender, No! No! Fancy men are defenseless against cone of coldness. [He acts like he's about to freeze.] I'm freezing... what? Ah! [His body goes ridged and falls over.]
Bender's Game Part 1,<poem>Fry," Bender, no. When will young people learn that Dungeons & Dragons won't make you cool?"
Bender's Game Part 1,Zoidberg," Relax, Fry. I'm a doctor. I'm sure the robut will be just fine with a little help."
Bender's Game Part 1,Bender," Help, help. [Cut to reveal he's in a padded cell in a straight jacket.] (Echoing ) Help! [Cut to show the exterior of his cell. Cut to exterior shot of the HAL Institute - For Criminally Insane Robots.]"
Bender's Game Part 1,,
Bender's Game Part 2,,
Bender's Game Part 2,Roberto," Previously, on Futurama. Hah-haa! [he stabs the camera]"
Bender's Game Part 2,Dwight, A terrifying red dragon!
Bender's Game Part 2,Bender, I make use of my rod of fireballs. [He makes explosion noises.]
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth, The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence. [She is shocked.]
Bender's Game Part 2,Leela, Ouch!
Bender's Game Part 2,Fry," Bender, I think you might be [visuals cut to Bender running around with a sword, wearing a pot on his head. A bus hits him] playing too much Dungeons & Dragons."
Bender's Game Part 2,Bender," You're absolutely right, Fry. [visuals cut back to the kitchen] Now, if you'll excuse me. [He places the pot on his head.] I'm off to slay the werewolf of Goblin Mountain. [He waves his arms around, makes gibbery noises and dives head first out the window.]"
Bender's Game Part 2,,
Bender's Game Part 2,Dr. Perceptron," Please, send in the patient."
Bender's Game Part 2,Intercom Assistant," Yes, Doctor. [An arm extends out a pulls a lever on the desk. Bender falls from a door in the ceiling, still in the straight jacket, into a chair.]"
Bender's Game Part 2,Bender, Wee!
Bender's Game Part 2,Dr. Perceptron," So, (Low monotone voice ) Bender, (Normal voice )I understand you're having trouble separating fantasy from reality."
Bender's Game Part 2,Bender, Says who? Was it the bugbear? Is he talking about me again?
Bender's Game Part 2,Dr. Perceptron, I understand. Commence therapy. [He pushes a button on his clip board. A hammer comes down from the door in the ceiling and begins striking Bender on the head.]
Bender's Game Part 2,Fry, Poor Bender. Says here to tell his friends he's at a spa.
Bender's Game Part 2,Amy, So what happened to Bender?
Bender's Game Part 2,Fry, He's at a spa.
Bender's Game Part 2,Amy," Wow, there's a spa in the nut house?"
Bender's Game Part 2,Zoidberg," Friends, friends, stop everything. There's food in this shaker. [He begins sucking the salt out of a salt shaker, accidentally swallows it and sneezes mucus all Leela, who becomes angry and is administered a shock.]"
Bender's Game Part 2,Leela, Ow! Can you please remove this anger collar?
Bender's Game Part 2,Hermes, Are you still angry?
Bender's Game Part 2,Leela (Assuring), No. [She is shocked.] Ow!
Bender's Game Part 2,Hermes, It also shocks you when you lie.
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," Quiet, everyone. The network news is on and if I, a 165-year-old man, don't watch it, who will?"
Bender's Game Part 2,Morbo," Thankfully, the amazing talking horse was rescued and safely returned to the meat department."
Bender's Game Part 2,Linda," [She laughs.] Turning to the less stupid portion of our broadcast, fuel prices hit an all-time high today due to the ongoing dark matter shortage."
Bender's Game Part 2,Morbo," Earlier, our own Morbo sat down with Mom, CEO of Mom's Friendly Multinational Energy Conglomerate."
Bender's Game Part 2,Morbo," [He sips his tea.] Morbo the Annihilator, here, sitting down to a delightful tea in this fake living room set. (Shouting ) Thank you for joining us, Mom."
Bender's Game Part 2,Mom," My pleasure, sugarplum."
Bender's Game Part 2,Morbo," Mom, you control the world's only dark matter mine. Why are fuel prices so high?"
Bender's Game Part 2,Mom," Oh! It's terrible, isn't it? Dark matter is just so rare nowadays, but we'll keep pinching loaf after loaf from the bowels of the earth, even if I lose money on every log."
Bender's Game Part 2,Morbo," If you are losing money, how did you post record profits last quarter?"
Bender's Game Part 2,Mom," You look thin, care for one of my famous pecan clusters?"
Bender's Game Part 2,Morbo," [He reaches for one, but hesitates.] Morbo shouldn't. It will go straight to Morbo's gargantuan forehead. Oh, what the heck? I guess I could destroy one or two of them. [He devours the entire plate and all of the cookies.]"
Bender's Game Part 2,Mom, Do people care enough to drill for dark matter even in an Alaskan wildlife refuge? People do.
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," Greedy old hag, taste the wrath of my fuzzy slipper. [He hurls the slipper toward the TV, but it doesn't make it and floats to the ground.]"
Bender's Game Part 2,Leela," Professor, why are you so hot and dusty over this dark matter shortage?"
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," Oohh... I bet you'd like to know. I bet you'd like to know, indeed."
Bender's Game Part 2,Walt," Hello, Mother. How did the interview go?"
Bender's Game Part 2,Mom, It made me want to puke my face off. Where's my Thigh Blaster?
Bender's Game Part 2,Larry," Right here, Mom."
Bender's Game Part 2,Mom, Shut up!
Bender's Game Part 2,Larry," Okay, thank you."
Bender's Game Part 2,Mom," Burn, you damn thighs. Burn!"
Bender's Game Part 2,Igner," Mommy, are you upset 'cause of the dark matter shortage?"
Bender's Game Part 2,Mom," There is no shortage, you moronic ass-brain!"
Bender's Game Part 2,Inger, There's not? But you said...
Bender's Game Part 2,Mom, [She sighs.] Allow me to explain. Suppose this hand represents current reserves of dark matter and this hand represents consumer demand.
Bender's Game Part 2,Igner, Uh-huh.
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth, I just bet you'd like to know why I'm so angry about this dark matter shortage. I bet very much you'd like to know.
Bender's Game Part 2,Amy," You're right, Professor. We would like to know."
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," Really? I didn't think anyone was interested. It all started 30-odd years ago. [Farnsworth starts a VO. Fade to a flashback of Farnsworth sitting at a desk. He is molding a chemistry model and Mom joins him, similar to the scene from Ghost.] I was working in Mom's laboratories for the third time after twice before realizing how evil she was and vowing never to work for her again. But somehow the rich, wrong stench of her boney charms kept calling me back."
Bender's Game Part 2,Zoidberg," Don't stop, Professor. I'm getting aroused. [His mating fin rises.]"
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," Back in those days, dark matter was just a worthless inert curiosity, and I was smashing it in a particle accelerator, in an ill-conceived attempt to create a more durable harpsichord wax. But, as Deepak Chopra taught us, quantum physics means anything can happen at any time for no reason. Also, eat plenty of oatmeal and animals never had a war. Who's the real animals? [Small pause.] And thus against all probabilities... it happened. [The dark matter particles in the particle accelerator begin colliding and exploding. A large explosion leaves only a single item - the single non-local metaparticle crystal."
Bender's Game Part 2,Younger Farnsworth, Dang!
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth, I'm sure I don't need to explain that all dark matter in the universe is linked in the form of a single non-local meta-particle.
Bender's Game Part 2,Amy, Guhh! Stop patronizing us.
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," So, in one instant, I had transformed all dark matter everywhere into a new crystalline form... (Younger Farnsworth to Younger Mom ) ...making it the most potent fuel since primitive man first ignited mastodon flatulence to heat his cave."
Bender's Game Part 2,Younger Mom," I'm intrigued, Hubert. You have my undivided attention."
Bender's Game Part 2,Younger Mom," Shut up, you milk-sucking leeches! A new super fuel, eh? We're rich."
Bender's Game Part 2,Younger Farnsworth," Indeed, we are."
Bender's Game Part 2,Younger Mom," Not you, we. Us, we. [A younger Wernstrom walks into her arm.] I'm getting back together with my ex-husband."
Bender's Game Part 2,Younger Farnsworth, Wernstrom!
Bender's Game Part 2,Younger Wernstrom," You've been played, Farnsworth. Played like a cheap harpsichord."
Bender's Game Part 2,Younger Mom," Walt, fire that employee like Mommy taught you."
Bender's Game Part 2,Leela," Professor, maybe I can help you get even with Mom. I spend most of my time thinking about how to get revenge on a bad boss."
Bender's Game Part 2,Fry," Me, too."
Bender's Game Part 2,Zoidberg, Ditto!
Bender's Game Part 2,Hermes, Likewise.
Bender's Game Part 2,Amy, I made a blinding powder.
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," Thanks, but that won't be necessary because I have the ultimate weapon. [Cut to the scene when the first crystal was created. A black crystal shoots out of the machine and Farnsworth puts it in his pocket. VO ] You see, in the instant the energy crystal was created, there also came into being an opposite crystal made of pure anti-backwards energy."
Bender's Game Part 2,ALL, Wow!
Bender's Game Part 2,Hermes, So?
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," So, this! If ever the two crystals should meet, their wave functions would collapse like Raymond Burr's trampoline, once again rendering all dark matter inert and useless as fuel."
Bender's Game Part 2,Hermes, But then we'll have no fuel.
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," But once we free society from dependence on Mom's dark matter, scientists will finally care enough to develop cleaner, alternative fuels."
Bender's Game Part 2,Fry, Scientists like you!
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," No, not me. I'm too busy developing makeup for dogs. That's where the money is."
Bender's Game Part 2,Leela, [Her collar is active during her rousing.] This is our chance to teach Mom a lesson. Let's take the anti-crystal and shove it up Mom's regular crystal.
Bender's Game Part 2,ALL, Yeah.
Bender's Game Part 2,Hermes, Fight the power!
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," There's just one, small problem, and it's a big one. I hid the crystal and I can't remember where."
Bender's Game Part 2,Hermes, Surely it's just a matter of waiting till you next move your bowels and then using a potato masher...
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," Don't you think I already tried that? No. I'm afraid, the crystal is lost forever."
Bender's Game Part 2,Dwight, Nine? You did it. You outwitted the fungus.
Bender's Game Part 2,ALL, Woohoo!
Bender's Game Part 2,Chinese Boy, Who needs girls?
Bender's Game Part 2,Dr. Perceptron," Since you have all proven resistant to individualized hammer therapy, I now prescribe group therapy."
Bender's Game Part 2,Rosie," Everything must be clean, very clean. That's why the dog had to die. He was a dirty dog. Dirty, dirty. Also, that boy, Elroy. Dirty, dirty."
Bender's Game Part 2,Dr. Perceptron, Who would like to share their feelings?
Bender's Game Part 2,Intercom Assistant, I feel unappreciated at work.
Bender's Game Part 2,Dr. Perceptron, What? I can barely understand you.
Bender's Game Part 2,Intercom Assistant, I said I feel...
Bender's Game Part 2,Mad Hatterbot, Change places.
Bender's Game Part 2,Roberto," Well, well. Looks like old Roberto is the focus of attention now. Stop looking at me. [He makes his ""knifing"" noises.]"
Bender's Game Part 2,Dr. Perceptron," Calm down, Roberto. Tell us about your childhood."
Bender's Game Part 2,Roberto, I was designed by a team of engineers attempting to build an insane robot. But it seems they failed.
Bender's Game Part 2,Convenience Store Bot," Um, actually... [He is stabbed, then coughs up some candy bars.]"
Bender's Game Part 2,Bender," Look, we have to accept the fact that we all have a serious problem."
Bender's Game Part 2,Roberto, Amen.
Bender's Game Part 2,Dr. Perceptron," Good, Bender."
Bender's Game Part 2,Rosie, That's right.
Bender's Game Part 2,Bender," There's a band of river trolls living in the moat and they may have no intention of letting us out of this castle, unless we hand over the Golden Scepter of Zanthor."
Bender's Game Part 2,Roberto, Say what? Dude's crazy.
Bender's Game Part 2,Dr. Perceptron," Bender, please, try to..."
Bender's Game Part 2,Bender," I know not of this Bender. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood."
Bender's Game Part 2,Dr. Perceptron, You are suffering a breakdown. [He pushes a button and a hammer smashes his glass head.] I'm in your seat. I forgot we had changed places.
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone!"
Bender's Game Part 2,Amy, You perfected dog mascara?
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," Far from it. If you ask me, they look like a bunch of hookers. But what I have invented is a means of locating the missing crystal. [Everybody gasps.] When I push this button, the crystal will emit a high-frequency stink."
Bender's Game Part 2,Zoidberg, [He is putting on eye mascara.] Hurray!
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," There. Now, with any luck I'll detect it with my smelling aid. [He sticks a device in his nose and it begins beeping.] I just pray to all powerful Atheismo that we find it before Mom does."
Bender's Game Part 2,Hermes," Do you smell the crystal, Professor?"
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," No, damn it! Just the alluring scent of Obsession for spaniels."
Bender's Game Part 2,Dwight, Dude. Who whipped an egger?
Bender's Game Part 2,"CubertHe who smelled it, dealt it.",
Bender's Game Part 2,Dwight," Well, he who denied it, supplied it."
Bender's Game Part 2,Cubert," Well, he who articulated it, particulated it."
Bender's Game Part 2,Dwight," Well, he who refuted it, tooted it."
Bender's Game Part 2,Cubert, Stalemate.
Bender's Game Part 2,Mom, Jesus craps. The anti-backwards crystal.
Bender's Game Part 2,Larry, Ow! Ah... sorry?
Bender's Game Part 2,Mom," Relax, it's not your fault. [She slaps him again.] I can't believe it still exists. Google the hell out of that skanker. [The map zooms into Planet Express.] Planet-sucking-Express? Of course. How could I have been so dumb? [She slaps herself.] With that crystal, Farnsworth could completely destroy my dark matter empire. I underestimated that sagging old bag of bones and gonads."
Bender's Game Part 2,Inger, Is that man bad?
Bender's Game Part 2,Mom," Very bad, Igner. And that's why I need you three to go steal the anti-crystal away from him. But be careful. You'll need all your stoogely cunning."
Bender's Game Part 2,Walt, Exterminators.
Bender's Game Part 2,Fry," Oh, great. What do we got? Wall gophers? Toilet snails?"
Bender's Game Part 2,Walt," No, I'm afraid you've got owls. Over there, see?"
Bender's Game Part 2,Igner, Ow!
Bender's Game Part 2,Walt," Dump the bag, you nitwit."
Bender's Game Part 2,Larry," Hey, watch it. [He holds up a mouse trap.]"
Bender's Game Part 2,Walt," Quiet, you. [He gets his hand caught in the mouse trap.] Ow!"
Bender's Game Part 2,Fry," I was looking over there for a long time but I didn't see any... Oh, there they are. Gross."
Bender's Game Part 2,Walt," We've got to act fast. Larry, get out the geigersniffer."
Bender's Game Part 2,Larry, You're just gonna hit me with it.
Bender's Game Part 2,Walt," No. I'm going to hit you with this. [Walt hits Larry's shield on his mask and knocks him over. Cut to the lounge, the three can still be head in the background as Leela and Amy sit on the couch. Fry enters.]"
Bender's Game Part 2,Fry, Those three exterminators are hilarious.
Bender's Game Part 2,Amy, Really? I don't think so.
Bender's Game Part 2,Leela," Me, neither. Now, Sex and the City, that's funny."
Bender's Game Part 2,Dwight," After wandering aimlessly in the swamp, you suddenly... [He rolls the dice.] wander aimlessly in the swamp."
Bender's Game Part 2,Walt, There it is. [Larry and Igner walk into him after he has stopped.]
Bender's Game Part 2,Cubert," Uh, excuse you."
Bender's Game Part 2,Walt," I'm sorry, little boy. You see, we're owl exterminators."
Bender's Game Part 2,Igner, We are owl extermin... [Larry pulls the ladder back and lets it hit Igner in the head.] Ow!
Bender's Game Part 2,Walt," And what we have here is an owl egg that's about to hatch into an owl larva. So, if you don't mind, we'll just take this and..."
Bender's Game Part 2,Cubert," [He scoffs.] What are you, stupid? That's a dodecahedral crystal I found hidden in the downstairs walrus tank."
Bender's Game Part 2,Dwight," And I wrote numbers on it so we could use it as a D12, 'cause I have the best handwriting."
Bender's Game Part 2,Cubert, Do not.
Bender's Game Part 2,Dwight, Do too.
Bender's Game Part 2,Cubert, Do not.
Bender's Game Part 2,Dwight, Do too.
Bender's Game Part 2,Cubert, You win this round.
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth, What's going on here?
Bender's Game Part 2,Igner, We're owl exterminators.
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth, Oh? Then you won't have any problem exterminating this owl.
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," My anti-backwards crystal. So it's you three. I should have known Mom would send her brainless brood to do her dirty work. Walt, the leader among imbeciles."
Bender's Game Part 2,Walt, Hey! They resent that.
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," Larry, the snivelling middle child."
Bender's Game Part 2,Larry, Sorry. Thank you.
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," And you, Igner. The evil I could tolerate, but the stupidity... [He shudders.]"
Bender's Game Part 2,<poem>Igner, We're owl exterminators.
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," Good God. Just knowing we're in the same genus makes me embarrassed to call myself homo. [The boys start laughing.] Now, get out and tell Mom thanks for the crystal. [He laughs while staring at the crystal. Cut to the three brothers standing in front of Mom.]"
Bender's Game Part 2,Igner, Thanks for the crystal.
Bender's Game Part 2,Fry, There. The repairs are complete.
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," [He honks the horn.] Let's go, already. We've got to infiltrate Mom's dark matter mine, now. How do you start this thing? [Fry ducks out of the way as flames shoot out of the thrusters. Cut to a shot of Leela sifting through Nibbler's litter box. Farnsworth honks the honk again.] Good Lord, woman. Can you move any slower? [He honks the horn again.] Rake up some dark matter and top off the tank."
Bender's Game Part 2,Leela," Well, there isn't any dark matter. Nibbler hasn't pooped at all. And he ate a whole family of koalas last night. Nibbler! Nibbler!"
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth, I'm not interested in the whereabouts of your cutesy-fruitsy space rat. The only thing that matters right now is this crystal. [He throws the crystal at Leela's head.]
Bender's Game Part 2,Leela, Ow!
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth, And be careful with that crystal. [The ship takes off.]
Bender's Game Part 2,,
Bender's Game Part 2,[Scene," Bender is laying flat in a chair. He has mice and spiders crawling all over him, there is an alarm sounding off, the lights are flashing and there is a axe device swinging close to his head like a pendulum.]"
Bender's Game Part 2,,
Bender's Game Part 2,<poem>Bender, (Muffled chanting.) [Dr. Perceptron removes the tape from his mouth.] Death to ogres! [He put the tape back on.]
Bender's Game Part 2,Dr. Perceptron," Even relaxation therapy has failed. Nurse, schedule a robotomy for Bender."
Bender's Game Part 2,Nurse Ratchet," Yes, Doctor. I'll get the tools from the shed."
Bender's Game Part 2,Dr. Perceptron," It's a very painful procedure. So until then, just try to relax."
Bender's Game Part 2,Mom, What are you laughing at?
Bender's Game Part 2,Larry, Your laugh. It's just so infectious.
Bender's Game Part 2,Mom," So's herpes. Now, shut up! You and Walt, lead the killbots to the surface and blow Farnsworth out of the sky."
Bender's Game Part 2,Walt, What about Igner?
Bender's Game Part 2,Mom, That hairless ape? I swear. When he came out I flipped a coin whether to keep him or the after-birth.
Bender's Game Part 2,Walt," Yes, Mother. You told that story at his graduation."
Bender's Game Part 2,Mom," I'm afraid he can't be trusted on this mission. You see, there is a terrible secret about Igner I've never told anyone. And here it is."
Bender's Game Part 2,Walt, Continue returning fire.
Bender's Game Part 2,Killbot 1, [He turns to them while firing.] What?
Bender's Game Part 2,Killbot 2, [He turns around while firing too.] What did they say?
Bender's Game Part 2,Killbot 1, I don't know. I can't hear a thing.
Bender's Game Part 2,Killbot 3," [He turns around as well.] Hey, what's everybody talking about?"
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," Mayday! Mayday! [Walt and Larry flee from the defence line.] Oh, God. I cannot believe this is the best plan I could come up with. [The ship crashes just in front of the Killbots. Pull back to reveal Farnsworth holding a controller. He flicks a switch and a light goes off. Fry and Leela sit in the snow bank with him.] We weren't actually in the ship."
Bender's Game Part 2,Leela," Okay, team, these red-hot, razor-sharp fans are the only safe way into the mine."
Bender's Game Part 2,Fry," Hmm, uh, ladies first. [She pushes him through the blades, picks up Farnsworth and hops through. They're walking through a tunnel.] Phew! That blade missed me by the skin of my pants. [His pants have been cut open. The crew throw their jackets into a bin labelled ""CLOTHES FOR THE GREEDY."" Farnsworth presses the call button on a maintenance elevator.]"
Bender's Game Part 2,Elevator Steward, Maintenance shaft 7 serving...
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth, Shut your mouth.
Bender's Game Part 2,Elevator Steward, I'm just talking about the shaft.
Bender's Game Part 2,Fry," Jeez, doesn't that shock collar hurt?"
Bender's Game Part 2,Leela," Actually, feels kind of good. I guess I'm starting to associate it with the pleasure of beating people up."
Bender's Game Part 2,Walt," We shot them down, Mother. The intruders never even got to Sector 1."
Bender's Game Part 2,Security Woman (on PA), Intruders in Sector 15. Intruders in Sector 15.
Bender's Game Part 2,Mom, Ugh... Sometimes I don't know why I even bother to slap you. [She slaps them twice.] (on PA ) All Killbots to Sector 15.
Bender's Game Part 2,Killbot 1, [He turns to the other Killbot and shoots him.] What did she say?
Bender's Game Part 2,Killbot 2," [He turns to the other Killbot and shoots him.]What did you say? [The two of them stay position towards each other and eventually destroy themselves. Fry, Farnsworth and Leela dash by their bodies. Another view of a hallway shows balls of Dark Matter being transported through tubes.]"
Bender's Game Part 2,Fry," There are so many killbots behind us I can't count them all. Three, I think."
Bender's Game Part 2,Leela, We're trapped.
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth, The main pit must be in here. I'm detecting vast quantities of Dark Matter.
Bender's Game Part 2,Leela, Step aside turkey-neck. I think I know the code. [She punches the keypad and the door opens. They get in and slam it shut before the Killbots spot them.]
Bender's Game Part 2,Farnsworth," We're in. We're in the heart of the mine. The very source of all Mom's wealth and... [He lets out a long winded, girly scream. Pull away from them at the door down a huge room with caged Nibblonians occupying it. There are more floors featuring the same thing above and below. Cut to shots of the caged Nibblonians, their poop is being harvested and transported through clear pipes.]"
Bender's Game Part 2,Leela, My God! This isn't a crap mine. It's a crap farm.
Bender's Game Part 2,Fry, Is there really so much of a distinction? I mean...
Bender's Game Part 2,Nibbler," (From offscreen ) Leela, it's me, Nibbler."
Bender's Game Part 2,Leela," Oh, my God, you look horrible, Nibbler. I think I'm going to vomit."
Bender's Game Part 2,Nibblonian, Nibbler is over there.
Bender's Game Part 2,Leela," Oh, sorry. Nibbler!"
Bender's Game Part 2,,
Bender's Game Part 3,,
Bender's Game Part 3,Morbo," Previously, on puny Futurama. Mwaah! [he devours the camera]"
Bender's Game Part 3,Bender," Foolish leprechaun, I scoop your treasure in the name of the fancy men. [He scoops Nibbler's poop and dumps it in his chest.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,Fry," Bender, I think you might be [visuals cut to Bender running around with a sword, wearing a pot on his head] playing too much Dungeons & Dragons."
Bender's Game Part 3,Bender," I know not of this Bender. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood."
Bender's Game Part 3,Dr. Perceptron," Please, send in the patient."
Bender's Game Part 3,Bender, Wee!
Bender's Game Part 3,Farnsworth, The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence. [She is shocked.]
Bender's Game Part 3,Leela, Ouch!
Bender's Game Part 3,Fry," Jeez, doesn't that shock collar hurt?"
Bender's Game Part 3,Leela," Actually, I guess I'm starting to associate it with the pleasure of beating people up."
Bender's Game Part 3,Morbo," Mom, you control the world's only dark matter mine."
Bender's Game Part 3,Leela," My God! This isn't a crap mine. It's a crap farm. [Cut to shots of the caged Nibblonians, their poop is being harvested and transported through clear pipes.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,,
Bender's Game Part 3,Leela," Oh, my poor little snuzzy-wuzzams. Are they treating you okay?"
Bender's Game Part 3,Nibbler," No, they are force-feeding us so we poop more dark matter. It's horrible. [A chime tings and chickens fly out of a hole at the rear of his cage and he ""reluctantly"" eats them whole then belches.] Those are good. You've got to help us."
Bender's Game Part 3,Nibblonians, Help us!
Bender's Game Part 3,Nibblonian," Help us, for God's sakes!"
Bender's Game Part 3,Leela, Nibbler made a bo-bo.
Bender's Game Part 3,Nibbler," But not on my terms. I will not be treated like... Hey, wait, aren't you amazed I can speak?"
Bender's Game Part 3,Fry," Well, actually, no. You forgot to blank our memories after you spoke last time."
Bender's Game Part 3,Nibbler, Then why did you let me eat Friskies and make bo-bo in a litter box?
Bender's Game Part 3,Fry," Well, you're cuter that way."
Bender's Game Part 3,Farnsworth, Cute as a baby's buttocks.
Bender's Game Part 3,Leela, So what happened? How did Mom capture all you Nibblonians?
Bender's Game Part 3,Nibbler," [He sighs.] It all began 36 years ago... [He looks at his watch.] Now! On the planet Vergon 6. [Fade to the surface of Vergon 6. There are many animals moving around.] (VO ) It was a veritable Eden, brimming with unique and irreplaceable species. [Nibbler eats a tortoise looking animal.] Most of which were delicious. [he belches up the animal's shell.] I was Supreme Fuzzler of a Nibblonian scientific outpost. It was paradise, until they came. One of your DOOP ships struck dark matter, little realizing it was not a natural deposit, but rather centuries of Nibblonian fecal material."
Bender's Game Part 3,Fry, The big faecal enchilada. Anyone else hungry?
Bender's Game Part 3,Nibbler, The DOOP contracted a ruthless businesswoman to spearhead the mining operation.
Bender's Game Part 3,Leela, Let me guess. Mom?
Bender's Game Part 3,Nibbler, The very same.
Bender's Game Part 3,Fry, Can I also guess Mom?
Bender's Game Part 3,Nibbler," To reduce cost she started a new enterprise, Mom's Friendly Robots, to build robot slaves. Remember this was back in the days before Robot Lincoln."
Bender's Game Part 3,Mom," Faster, faster!"
Bender's Game Part 3,Robot Slave, I'm going exactly as fast as you built me to go.
Bender's Game Part 3,Mom," Oh, wise guy, huh?"
Bender's Game Part 3,Robot Slave, Ow!
Bender's Game Part 3,Nibbler," Eventually, the planet was mined down to a hollow shell and my people were forced to evacuate. [A Nibblonian ship is shown leaving the planet. Pan over to see Nibbler squatting down in some plants.] Alas, I had eaten a day-old Swinosaur for lunch. And while doing some evacuating of my own, I was left behind. [He makes noises that often accompany bowel movements. Mom is watching him Mom  So, that's where it comes from. We may have a whole new source of Dark Matter on our hands."
Bender's Game Part 3,Igner, Eww!
Bender's Game Part 3,Nibbler," As it turned out I was the lucky one. [The Nibblonian ship is seen entering Mom's ship.] Unbeknownst to me, Mom captured my colleagues and enslaved them here in this... this... crap farm."
Bender's Game Part 3,Nibblonian," There's nothing to do but eat and crap, eat and crap. It's like visiting my parents."
Bender's Game Part 3,Nibbler," As for me, I emerged from behind the ""bush of many uses"" to find I had been left behind. I was doomed, doomed."
Bender's Game Part 3,[Scene from Loves Labours Lost in Space],
Bender's Game Part 3,Leela," Hello, there."
Bender's Game Part 3,Nibbler," Startled, my cuteness reflex kicked in."
Bender's Game Part 3,Leela, I'll call him Nibbler.
Bender's Game Part 3,Nibbler," A silly name for a high-ranking Fuzzler. But, hey, I was glad to be rescued. [Flashback Nibbler watches Vergon 6 explode.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Leela," But then, how did you end up here with the others?"
Bender's Game Part 3,Nibbler, I was kidnapped yesterday by Mom's vile sons in their moronic disguises.
Bender's Game Part 3,Igner, I was an owl exterminator. [They turn around. Igner is pointing a gun at them.] Do you have the crysal?
Bender's Game Part 3,Farnsworth," It's pronounced ""crystal,"" you lump."
Bender's Game Part 3,Igner," Go, run fast. [He points at the large pipe labelled ""Primary Chicken Valve."" A marching is heard and the door opens. Walt, Larry and many Killbots enter the room.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Walt, Did you see anyone?
Bender's Game Part 3,Igner, Me?
Bender's Game Part 3,Walt," Yes, you. You're the only one here."
Bender's Game Part 3,Igner," If I'm the only one here, then how could I see anyone?"
Bender's Game Part 3,Larry," He's got a point, Walt."
Bender's Game Part 3,Walt, So does my knee.
Bender's Game Part 3,Fry, This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the chickens.
Bender's Game Part 3,Nurse Ratchet," Don't worry, those clamps are for my own protection."
Bender's Game Part 3,Dr. Perceptron," Do you know where you are, Bender?"
Bender's Game Part 3,Bender," Sure do, I'm in the magical land of Cornwood, frolicking with wenches."
Bender's Game Part 3,Dr. Perceptron, Close. You're in the loony bin for a robotomy. [He begins drilling through Bender's eye.]
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Nurse Ratchet, Can't you just use the access panel?
Bender's Game Part 3,Dr. Perceptron, Either way is fine.
Bender's Game Part 3,Bender, [He sniffs.] Does anyone else smell burning dragon beak?
Bender's Game Part 3,Mom," Wherever you are, Farnsworth, my boys will find you. [She pans over the security monitors on her desk. Her three sons approach her.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Walt," They've eluded us, Mother. But rest assured, we've already slapped each other, so there's no need to... [She triple slams them.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Mom, You'll thank me some day when you are slapping your own kids. [She walks over to the single non-local metaparticle crystal.] I know Farnsworth's game. He is going to try to poke his clammy old crystal at my hot fiery crystal.
Bender's Game Part 3,Larry, Mom!
Bender's Game Part 3,Mom, If the crystals get within six inches of each other... [She slaps Larry.] Wham! All my dark matter will be worthless.
Bender's Game Part 3,Mom, Get them!
Bender's Game Part 3,Leela," [Swings over to the top of the incline the brothers are trying to scale and slides down, boot first, at them. She kicks them and then slides across the icy floor. The collar is emitting a shock.] Ooh. That feels good."
Bender's Game Part 3,Mom," Oh, for crying out... [She fires at Farnsworth, but the shots quickly whither away to nothing.] Oh, the freaking battery's dead. Walt, where's the charger?"
Bender's Game Part 3,Walt," In the hardware drawer, Mother. [Leela punches him and she is shocked.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Mom, Damn tangled mess of wires.
Bender's Game Part 3,Farnsworth," We're almost there. The crystals are beginning to engorge. [Leela and the brothers are trying to battle on ice, Mom is trying to untangle the charger and Fry is hanging onto Farnsworth as he leans closer to the single non-local metaparticle crystal.] I can't quite reach. Fry, grab onto my easy-fit waistband. Just a few more inches. Come on, really wedgie it on in there. [Fry pulls harder on the underpants and they rip, sending Farnsworth toward the ground. He, somehow, lands on his feet.] So, that's why they call me the Catman. [Fry lands behind him.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Mom," Nobody move. I've found the charger. [She clicks the trigger twice and nothing happens.] Hang on. I'm on it. Okay, there!"
Bender's Game Part 3,Fry," Save us, Catman."
Bender's Game Part 3,Mom," It's over, Hubert. Give me the anti-backwards crystal."
Bender's Game Part 3,Farnsworth," Never! [He eats the crystal and begins to chuckle. The crystal glows in his stomach, along with the keys to the ship.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Mom," Oh, bravo. You're in a crap-harvesting factory, genius. Walt! Larry! Start harvesting. [Walt picks up a large syringe labelled ""Prunes"" and Larry picks up a bucket.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,Farsnworth, No! [Mom laughs.]
Bender's Game Part 3,[Cut back to the robotomy.],
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Dr. Perceptron," I will now delicately jerk out your imagination, severing fantasy's grip on your nerd-circuit."
Bender's Game Part 3,Bender, Cornwood! [Purple waves expanding from Bender's head fills the screen and Bender vanishes in a bright flash.]
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Dr. Perceptron, Illogical. Illogical.
Bender's Game Part 3,Nurse Ratchet," But, Doctor, I love you. [Dr. Perceptron's head explodes.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,[Cut back to Mom. She is still laughing.],
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Mom," Oh, what now?"
Bender's Game Part 3,Frydo," This is crazy. Ow! What the... You okay, Leela?"
Bender's Game Part 3,Leegola, I think so.
Bender's Game Part 3,Frydo, Wait a second. Is there something different about your hooves? [He gasps.]
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Leegola," Oh, Lord. I'm half-horse and half-naked."
Bender's Game Part 3,Frydo," Where the hell are we, hell?"
Bender's Game Part 3,Frydo, Bender?
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith, I know not of this Bender. I'm Titanius Anglesmith. Welcome to Cornwood!
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith," Wretched peasants, put aside your cares and feast on the succulent flesh of the roast munchkin!"
Bender's Game Part 3,Peasent Cook, Care for a slice of scroto?
Bender's Game Part 3,Frydo," Uh... that's his name, right?"
Bender's Game Part 3,Peasent Cook," 'Tis also that, sir."
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith," We're honored this eve by a visit from my friends of old, Frydo and Leegola. So let the dwarves do their gay dance and let the gnomes play their sissy piccolos. [They begin dancing and music is played.] Dance! Dance, you little freaks. Faster. [The music speeds up.] Faster! [The dancing and music speeds up more and a dwarf trips and falls toward Titanius Anglesmith.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Dwarf, My ankle!
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith, To the kitchen with him!
Bender's Game Part 3,Dwarf," Wait! Wait! Wait! I do impressions. Behold! The swamp hag  ""Get out of my swamp, you kids!"""
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith, Don't let him get too crispy.
Bender's Game Part 3,Calculon, Lord Anglesmith.
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith," You have ridden hard, noble squire. May I offer you a horn of ale and a shank of dwarf?"
Bender's Game Part 3,Calculon," 'Tis dire news, sire. Dark riders approach."
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith," [He gasps.] You shall be handsomely rewarded, sir knight. We ride at once! [He pulls one of two ropes in front of a sign labelled ""Drawbridge"" and Calculon is squished by the drawbridge.] Oops! [He pulls the second rope and the drawbridge flips over to the other side.] Frydo! Saddle up that trusty steed."
Bender's Game Part 3,Frydo, What's happening? And why am I enjoying it so much?
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith, Foul beast-bags! Meet thy doom!
Bender's Game Part 3,Waltazar, Follow me.
Bender's Game Part 3,Waltazar," Damn thee, Ignus."
Bender's Game Part 3,Larius," Well, you said to follow you."
Bender's Game Part 3,Waltazar," Well, now I say follow this! [He hits Larius with the handle of his lance. Frydo falls to the ground and drops the Die of Power on the ground.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Larius, The Die of Power! He's rolling it.
Bender's Game Part 3,Waltazar," Oh, no!"
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith, I'm back bab-... [He gasps and falls to his knees as he watches the die roll.]
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Die of Power," Seven. [An appendix comes out of the die and the seventh attack is ""Banish Foes.""]"
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Titanius Anglesmith," ""Banish foes""? Cool."
Bender's Game Part 3,Waltazar, No! No!
Bender's Game Part 3,Larius," I got to say, I had no idea the Die of Power was so powerful."
Bender's Game Part 3,Waltazar, Did you have any idea of... [He backhands Larius.]
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Swamp Hag," Get out of my swamp, you kids!"
Bender's Game Part 3,Leegola," I can't believe I'm saying this, but that was really exciting. I've never felt so alive. [Frydo makes death noises.] What else can we slay? Is that a hobbit over there?"
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith," No, that's a hobo and a rabbit. But they're making a hobbit."
Bender's Game Part 3,Frydo," Thank God, an outhouse."
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith," Hush! This be no outhouse, but the lair of the great wizard Grayfarn."
Bender's Game Part 3,Greyfarn, Who is it? [He opens the door.]
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Titanius Anglesmith," 'Tis I, Titanius."
Bender's Game Part 3,Greyfarn, Just a moment. [He closes the door.]
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Titanius Anglesmith," [He shakes his head and makes a disgusted noise.] Methinks the wizard be casting a powerful spell, indeed."
Bender's Game Part 3,Greyfarn," Come in! Come in! Yes. 'Tis a powerful object in both our worlds. If you failed to destroy it in yours, perhaps you were brought here that you might have a second chance."
Bender's Game Part 3,Frydo," So, this land is real?"
Bender's Game Part 3,Greyfarn," Oh, dreadfully real. If you die here, you'll really be dead. But instead of science, we believe in crazy hocus-pocus. It's like Kansas."
Bender's Game Part 3,Leegola, God help us.
Bender's Game Part 3,Greyfarn," Cornwood's troubles began hundreds or perhaps millions of years ago. (VO ) Deep in the Geysers of Gygax, Momon herself injection-molded the Dice of Power from the living plastic."
Bender's Game Part 3,Momon (in flashback)," [She picks up the freshly molded dice and begins laughing.] Damn, these are hot."
Bender's Game Part 3,Leegola, Ah ha! In our universe she's called Mom.
Bender's Game Part 3,Greyfarn," In your universe, are you taught not to interrupt? Evidently not. Anyway, Momon spawned three rotten sons, whom you've already had the displeasure of meeting. Waltazar, Larius, and the dumbest of all, the halfwit Ignus, bastard son of Momon and the brainless He-demon. Curse you, Momon, queen of all that is evil and not very good in bed. And I'm not just saying that because she dumped me. [Fade to flashback. Momon is plucking her eyebrows with a scorpion while Greyfarn is playing a euchalali.] (VO ) Yes, I was once her consort. I was blinded by love, and later, scorpion venom. [Momon squirts venom in his eyes.] I'm blind! (Out of flashback ) But Momon has one weakness. She put too much of her power into this. The generalissimo of dice. [He places the black Die of Power on a table.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Titanius Anglesmith," Well, bite my shiny metal face. [He slams his face against the die and the table.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Greyfarn," Don't be foolish, Titanius. If you had paid attention in freshman alchemy, instead of frequenting the bawdyhouse, you'd know there's only one way to destroy it. In the boiling plastic from which it was molded."
Bender's Game Part 3,Frydo, Like that machine that makes wax lions at the zoo.
Bender's Game Part 3,Greyfarn," Quiet, you. We must infiltrate the Geysers of Gygax, the impenetrable stronghold of Momon."
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith," Impossible. Impossible, I say."
Bender's Game Part 3,Greyfarn," No, Titanius. For we maintain one advantage, the element of surprise. [Pan over to the die, Momon is watching through it while laughing.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,,
Bender's Game Part 3,[Scene, The crew is walking through a light forest.]
Bender's Game Part 3,,
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Titanius Anglesmith," Verily, our quest has begun."
Bender's Game Part 3,Hermaphrodite, Stop right there.
Bender's Game Part 3,Frydo, Hermes?
Bender's Game Part 3,Leegola, He's a centaur like me.
Bender's Game Part 3,Frydo, You wish.
Bender's Game Part 3,Hermaphrodite," I am Hermaphrodite, most beautiful of centaurs. Gaze upon me and weep at my loveliness."
Bender's Game Part 3,Greyfarn, Very well.
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith," Loveliest of centaurs, we seek to end Momon's reign of evil. Have you stout fighters at your command?"
Bender's Game Part 3,Hermaphrodite, One thousand archers of truest aim. [Pan over to many archers standing on a hill.] Fire!
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith," Hey guys, I forgot I had this pumpkin. [He holds up the pumpkin and the archers' arrows carve it into a sculpture of Titanius. One more arrow comes in on fire and lights the jack-o-lantern.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Leegola, I knew it. My people are mighty warriors. Our enemies will be like Swiss cheese with blood coming out of the holes.
Bender's Game Part 3,Female Centaur, We centaurs are creatures of peace.
Bender's Game Part 3,Leegola," Oh, Lord."
Bender's Game Part 3,Hermaphrodite," Violence is never justified. We shall not join your quest. And furthermore, if mayhem be your intent, you may not cross our lands."
Bender's Game Part 3,Leegola, Or what?
Bender's Game Part 3,Hermaphrodite, [He is intimidated.] Or... Uh... Mmm?
Bender's Game Part 3,Greyfarn," We're not there, we're here."
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith," No, this way."
Bender's Game Part 3,Greyfarn," I mean, here."
Bender's Game Part 3,Greyfarn," Thank you, kindly, Treedledum."
Bender's Game Part 3,Treedledum, Okey-doke. Anything else I can do?
Bender's Game Part 3,Leegola, You know who I'm gonna miss? That tree guy.
Bender's Game Part 3,Greyfarn," Bad news, fancy men. Momon's guards stand watch at the pass. 'Tis as if she somehow anticipated us."
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith, And so our quest comes to an end. I only regret not giving up sooner.
Bender's Game Part 3,Greyfarn," Fret not, Titanius. For we still have one hope, the Cave of Hopelessness."
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith, Let me know how that turns out.
Bender's Game Part 3,Ogre, Halt. Are you on the list? I'm not seeing you on the list.
Bender's Game Part 3,Leegola, I'll split this doofus in half.
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith," Wait, I got it. Yeah. My cousin's in the band. The band of merry men. Please, we were already in there. I just need to go back for my coat."
Bender's Game Part 3,Gynecaladriel," I am Gynecaladriel, queen of the water nymphos."
Bender's Game Part 3,Leegola, All right. I'll split this doofus in half.
Bender's Game Part 3,Gynecaladriel," Stand aside and I will use my powers to overwhelm the guard. [Time cut, the four of them are standing at the entrance. Gynecaladriel walks out from behind a bush where the ogre is asleep and ties up her top.] Behold, the deed is done."
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith, Hi oh!
Bender's Game Part 3,Frydo," Mr. Wizard, why is this place called the Cave of Hopelessness?"
Bender's Game Part 3,Greyfarn," Oh, fear not, lad. 'Tis named for its discoverer, Reginald Hopelessness..."
Bender's Game Part 3,Frydo, Whew!
Bender's Game Part 3,Greyfarn, ...the first man to be eaten alive by the Tunneling Horror.
Bender's Game Part 3,Frydo, What's that? The Tunneling Horror?
Bender's Game Part 3,Gynecaladriel," No, it's morcs."
Bender's Game Part 3,Morcs," Hey, listen. Nanu, nanu. Shazbot."
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith," Oh, God, no. They're so aggravating."
Bender's Game Part 3,Morcs," Oh, fantastic. Nanu, nanu. Reality, what a concept. Fantastic. [During the killing, Gynecaladriel ends up kissing a mork.] Mindy, Mindy, Mindy."
Bender's Game Part 3,Gynecaladriel, Shut up! Shut up!
Bender's Game Part 3,Morcs," Oh, fantastic. Oh, fantastic. Oh, wonderful."
Bender's Game Part 3,Frydo, Maybe it'll go away if we just don't laugh at it.
Bender's Game Part 3,Titanius Anglesmith, It doesn't.
Bender's Game Part 3,Morcs," Nanu, nanu. [Leegola turns away from the tunnel.] Oh, shazbot. [She kicks the last mork with her back hooves.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Frydo," Well, at least we didn't have to face the tunneling whatchimacallit. [The cave begins to shake.] Uh-oh."
Bender's Game Part 3,Zoidberg, Enough already with the banging and the swashbuckling.
Bender's Game Part 3,Leegola," Oh, I'm gonna enjoy killing you. [she shoots an arrow into his chest and he snaps it off.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Zoidberg," Watch where you're shooting that thing. [She shoots him again.] Again? What, am I talking to myself over here?"
Bender's Game Part 3,Leegola, Mutilate! [She draws her sword and begins stabbing his belly.]
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Zoidberg," Okay. Now, I'm getting a little mad even."
Bender's Game Part 3,Leegola," I'll kill you and eat your heart, you abomination. [She slices his chest open, pulls out his heart and tears a chunk out with her teeth.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Zoidberg," [He laughs.] Don't make me laugh. The very idea that removing only one of my two hearts could... Hey, what are you doing down there? [Leegola pulls out his second heart and drops it.] Now, I'm dead. [He falls to the ground, but Leegola is still stabbing him.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Frydo," Leela, it's over. You killed him enough."
Bender's Game Part 3,Leegola, I'm not taking any chances with the Tunneling Horror.
Bender's Game Part 3,Zoidberg," What? I'm not the Tunneling Horror. I hate that guy. Always with the tunneling. Anyway, I'm dead. [He lays back down.]"
Bender's Game Part 3,<poem>Leegola," So, you're just an innocent monster. Oh, God. What have I done?"
Bender's Game Part 3,Zoidberg, Oh! There he goes again.
Bender's Game Part 3,,
Bender's Game Part 4,,
Bender's Game Part 4,Mom," Previously, on Futurama. [she slaps the camera]"
Bender's Game Part 4,Fry," Bender, I think you might be [visuals cut to Bender running around with a sword, wearing a pot on his head] playing too much Dungeons & Dragons."
Bender's Game Part 4,Bender," I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood."
Bender's Game Part 4,Younger Mom," A new super fuel, eh?"
Bender's Game Part 4,Mom, If the crystals get within six inches of each other... [She slaps Larry.] Wham! All my dark matter will be worthless.
Bender's Game Part 4,Mom, Give me the anti-backwards crystal.
Bender's Game Part 4,Farnsworth," Never! [He eats the crystal and begins to chuckle. The crystal glows in his stomach, along with the keys to the ship. The ground cracks open and everybody falls into the hole with the ice.]"
Bender's Game Part 4,[Scene, Cornwood]
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>Titanius Anglesmith, Welcome to Cornwood!
Bender's Game Part 4,Frydo, What's happening? And why am I enjoying it so much?
Bender's Game Part 4,Leegola, I'm not taking any chances with the Tunneling Horror.
Bender's Game Part 4,Zoidberg, I'm not the Tunneling Horror.
Bender's Game Part 4,"[The cave starts rumbling. A large, killer worm creature comes out of the ground and roars at Leegola and Frydo, who are standing on Zoidberg.]",
Bender's Game Part 4,[End of opening credits. Billboard lists creators and is crashed into],
Bender's Game Part 4,,
Bender's Game Part 4,[Scene," In the cave, the Tunneling Horror is growling at the group, who scream back at it.]"
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>Titanius Anglesmith, The Tunneling Horror! [He turns to the side and vomits nuts and bolts.]
Bender's Game Part 4,"[The Tunneling Horror lunges at Frydo and Leegola, but misses and grabs Titanius Anglesmith with its tail pincers.]",
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>Frydo," Why aren't you killing it, Leela? You love killing."
Bender's Game Part 4,Leegola," No, no more killing."
Bender's Game Part 4,Zoidberg," Oh! So, suddenly, Miss Goody Four-shoes over here doesn't kill anymore. She killed me not five minutes ago. What am I? Chopped liver?"
Bender's Game Part 4,Leegola, Shut up. [She slashes into his chest.]
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>Zoidberg, Ow! Stop chopping my liver.
Bender's Game Part 4,Leegola, You're on your own. (Sobbing ) I refuse to hurt another living thing. [She throws her sword behind her and it decapitates Zoidberg. She then gallops out of the cave. Frydo turns to look at Titanius Anglesmith getting thrashed around against the walls.]
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>Frydo," All right. I may be weak and I may be small, but I don't see how I can possibly destroy that monster. Guess I'll just huck whatever's in my pockets at him. At least I can say I tried."
Bender's Game Part 4,Titanius Anglesmith, Any time now.
Bender's Game Part 4,Frydo, The Die of Power. I forgot to remember to roll it.
Bender's Game Part 4,Die of Power, Three.
Bender's Game Part 4,Frydo," ""Grow?"" I don't see anything growing. Everything is getting smaller. [Frydo rips through his clothes and shoes as he grows in size then hits his head on the ceiling of the cave.] Ow. Wait a second. I'm big! In your face, everyone from middle school especially Jeremy. [He grabs the Tunneling Horror and begins punching it in the back, eventually punching a hole right through it. When he pulls his fist out air escapes from the creature and it shrinks down to the size of a normal bug and scampers to a hold in the wall. Frydo then shrinks back to normal size while laughing, his pitch matches his size.] Wow, that was intense. You guys got to try the Die of Power."
Bender's Game Part 4,Titanius Anglesmith, I'll take a hit.
Bender's Game Part 4,Frydo, Hands off the dodecalicious. [He snarls at Titanius Anglesmith and protects the die.]
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>Greyfarn," Beware, Frydo. Don't be seduced. Hang on a second. [He kisses Gynecaladriel.] Resist the allure of the die. For to defeat Momon, we must melt it in the super bombastic, bubbling plastic from whence it came."
Bender's Game Part 4,Greyfarn," We must melt it in the super bombastic, bubbling plastic from whence it came."
Bender's Game Part 4,Momon, I send you to kill them and they're not even maimed? That's what I get for sending boys to do a mom's job.
Bender's Game Part 4,Larius," Sorry, Mom."
Bender's Game Part 4,Momon, Sorry doesn't put heads on my table. Peaches. [An ogre comes out of a tunnel.] You're up.
Bender's Game Part 4,Ignus, I like this part but I don't like...
Bender's Game Part 4,Centaur Opponent," You are an able opponent, Hermaphrodite. But hear me well when I posit that we must abhor violence in all its forms."
Bender's Game Part 4,Hermaphrodite, I offer a dissenting opinion.
Bender's Game Part 4,ALL," [A gasp-like ""huh?""]"
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>Hermaphrodite," For abhorring violence is itself an act of violence and, therefore, to be abhorred. [The crowd cheers.] All bow before mighty Hermaphrodite. [Leegola walks up to him and he is scared.] Ah! Don't hurt me."
Bender's Game Part 4,Leegola," I'm not here to hurt you. Or anything ever again. Please, teach me the centaurs' ways of wimpiness."
Bender's Game Part 4,Hermaphrodite, What do you offer in return?
Bender's Game Part 4,Titanius Anglesmith," Yes! We made it out of that godforsaken cave. Now, what's the fastest way home? Back through the cave? [Greyfarn hits him in the head with his staff.] Ow! [His eye shield falls from its mounted position.] Ow!"
Bender's Game Part 4,Greyfarn," We're close now, my friends. So close, I can practically feel the heat of the fiery molten plastic."
Bender's Game Part 4,Gynecaladriel, You're standing in the fire.
Bender's Game Part 4,Greyfarn," Oh, my. [He yelps and walks out of the fire.] Alas, our path is blocked by Momon's army of evil. As well as her navy of moral dubiousness."
Bender's Game Part 4,Titanius Anglesmith, Mayhaps we might raise an army of our own. We're but an hour's ride from Wipe Castle.
Bender's Game Part 4,Greyfarn," Of course. Wipe Castle. And while we're there, we can get some of those greasy little dwarf burgers."
Bender's Game Part 4,Gynecaladriel, Ooh! I love those. You can eat like eight of them without gaining any weight because of all the diarrhea.
Bender's Game Part 4,Greyfarn," Sleep deep, fair snoozles. At dawn, we ride for Wipe Castle. [Frydo howls in front of the moon.] Quiet, Frydo. [He howls again, but softer.]"
Bender's Game Part 4,[Momon is watching from the die.],
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>Momon, We've got them now. Send all our forces against Wipe Castle.
Bender's Game Part 4,Waltazar," Right away, Mother. I'll just leave a small contingent behind in case..."
Bender's Game Part 4,Momon," I said, everything. Peaches!"
Bender's Game Part 4,Peaches (offscreen), I'm in the tub.
Bender's Game Part 4,Momon," Waltazar, you and Larius shall lead the assault."
Bender's Game Part 4,Waltazar, What about Ignus?
Bender's Game Part 4,Momon," I'm afraid he can't be trusted on this mission. You see, there is a terrible secret about Ignus I've never told anyone. And here it is."
Bender's Game Part 4,Momon," It's a good day to be evil. [She begins laughing, followed by Waltazar and Larius. Peaches joins in too.] Oh, put a towel on, for crap's sake. [She slaps him.]"
Bender's Game Part 4,,
Bender's Game Part 4,[Scene, Frydo ventures away from the camp to some rocks by the water.]
Bender's Game Part 4,,
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>Frydo, They all wants it. They wants the dodecalicious.
Bender's Game Part 4,Reflection Host," Tell you what, you want to defend a magic artifact, and I mean, defend it good, then what you need is a top-quality knife."
Bender's Game Part 4,Frydo, Me is listening.
Bender's Game Part 4,Reflection Host," The Eviscerator is one of the finest, if not the finest, tactical folder on the market today. We're talking 440 stainless, quick release and... I don't believe this. Is this a stag horn handle at this price?"
Bender's Game Part 4,Reflection Host 2," It is, yeah. It's a stag horn."
Bender's Game Part 4,Reflection Host," At this price? You have got to be kidding me. That's got to be some kind of mistake, right there."
Bender's Game Part 4,Reflection Host 2," Now, you folks at home, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, that can't be stag horn. It's got to be the cheaper manticore horn. But, I've got the specs right here and I'll tell you what, this is the real deal."
Bender's Game Part 4,Reflection Host, Unbelievable.
Bender's Game Part 4,Reflection Host 2," It is unbelievable. That's exactly what it is. I mean, this is... I have no words to describe this deal. Honestly, have you ever seen stag horn at this price?"
Bender's Game Part 4,Reflection Host," No, no, I don't believe I ever have."
Bender's Game Part 4,Reflection Host 2, 1101-1816 is the item number on this one.
Bender's Game Part 4,Reflection Host," You know what, we're gonna have to  put a clock on this deal, folks. Two minutes. Can I get a clock at two minutes up there?"
Bender's Game Part 4,Reflection Host 2," Two minutes at most. Honestly, I'd be surprised if they last that long."
Bender's Game Part 4,Reflection Host," Oh, I'd be very surprised, shocked really. Now, I know the lines are busy, people, but keep dialing in if you want a truly exceptional knife to slice up your friends in their sleep."
Bender's Game Part 4,Titanius Anglesmith," He tried to murder me. He tried... Woah, cool. Is that the stag horn?"
Bender's Game Part 4,Greyfarn," Alas, Frydo's weakness was no match for the die's strength. We can only hope he forges on alone to the Geysers."
Bender's Game Part 4,Titanius Anglesmith, I can hope my ass is made of ice-cream but that don't make me a hot fudge sundae.
Bender's Game Part 4,Greyfarn," As for us, we must press on to Wipe Castle, though the journey be long and I fear I may not live to see it."
Bender's Game Part 4,Gynecaladriel, There it is!
Bender's Game Part 4,Frydo, They's following us's.
Bender's Game Part 4,Zoidberg Head," You know, you talk like that, it's gonna cost you points at a job interview."
Bender's Game Part 4,Frydo, What does it wants?
Bender's Game Part 4,Zoidberg Head," I thought I could help you destroy the die, maybe."
Bender's Game Part 4,Frydo," (In his normal voice ) Yes, yes, please help me. The die is tearing me apart. (In his raspy voice ) No, it's not. We're having a nice time. (In his normal voice ) Shut up. (In his raspy voice ) You shut up. (In his normal voice ) S'all right? (In his raspy voice ) Who's a s'all right? (In his normal voice ) Help me!"
Bender's Game Part 4,URL," Now, before your audience with the king, there's a shocking fact you best know about him."
Bender's Game Part 4,Titanius Anglesmith, Enough blabbety-blab! Open the doors.
Bender's Game Part 4,Roberto," What, ho?"
Bender's Game Part 4,Titanius Anglesmith," We bring ill tidings, o fanciest of men. Momon's reach nears the die of power. And should she obtain it, she will then have the entire basic set. Rivers will run red with blood and yellow with urine. And a dog will be seen eating cat food in the land. Oh, great king, your army is the last hope of Cornwood. Let us join forces before the light of good is extinguished forever."
Bender's Game Part 4,Roberto, You calling me crazy? Just 'cause I've got a hotel in my foot don't make me a boogalee-moogalee-moogalee.
Bender's Game Part 4,Titanius Anglesmith, Pardon?
Bender's Game Part 4,Roberto," Stop laughing at me, fried avocado."
Bender's Game Part 4,Titanius Anglesmith, Moving along then. As the only nobleman present who's not... [He crosses his eyes and makes crazy noises.] ...I hereby place myself in command of the royal army.
Bender's Game Part 4,URL, What royal army would that be?
Bender's Game Part 4,Greyfarn, What?
Bender's Game Part 4,Smitty, King went insane and declared war on the scallops. Tied his army to a boulder and pushed them into the sea. They never returned.
Bender's Game Part 4,URL, Scallops must've got them. [Smitty nods.]
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>Greyfarn," Oh, well. There'll be no epic battle today."
Bender's Game Part 4,Titanius Anglesmith, Methinks we be boned.
Bender's Game Part 4,Larius, Where's their army?
Bender's Game Part 4,Waltazar, Maybe they didn't hear the horn. Blow it again. [He blows his horn.]
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>URL," Man, I'll show that cat how to blow. [He starts up with his jazz number again, but is blows away by the air escaping a horn placed in front of him. Cut to the ogres rushing the castle. The pull the drawbridge down and cross it with a ram to knock the doors open.]"

Bender's Game Part 4,Leegola, No! We've got to do something.
Bender's Game Part 4,Hermaphrodite," Believe me, we will. We've taken out a sternly worded ad in tomorrow's Cornwood Times. [He holds up a news paper with the headline ""There must be a better way"" printed on it above a picture of an ogre being beheaded. Leegola kicks through the paper and everybody gasps.]"
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>Leegola, What a load of man-horse manure.
Bender's Game Part 4,Hermaphrodite," Well, Leegola, if you have a better idea, perhaps you'd like to challenge me to debate."
Bender's Game Part 4,Frydo, I'm too exhausted. I can't go on.

Bender's Game Part 4,Frydo, I would. But... (In raspy voice ) Me's enjoys owning it.
Bender's Game Part 4,Zoidberg Head, Stop talking like that. It gives me anxiety. [He launches himself at Frydo and bites his tushie.]

[As the ogres stop, thousands of arrows strike them and all the ogres fall. Titanius is still holding up his two companions. He clears his throat.] Well, that worked out pretty good, eh, fellows?"
Bender's Game Part 4,Leegola," Prepare to fire again, brave cowards."
Bender's Game Part 4,Hermaphrodite," I still say, I won the debate. [Leegola strikes him in the stomach with a piece of wood.]"

Bender's Game Part 4,Ogre, Wuh-woah.
Bender's Game Part 4,Remaining Ogre, Whew!
Bender's Game Part 4,Gynecaladriel," Leegola, you saved us. How can I ever repay you? [She kisses Leegola, but it quickly turns into passionate kisses. A large eruption of the geysers breaks the kiss and they all gasp.]"
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>Greyfarn," Frydo is fighting for his life. Quickly, to the Geysers."
Bender's Game Part 4,Titanius Anglesmith, [While watching Leegola and Gynecaladriel kiss.] Can it wait a couple of minutes?
Bender's Game Part 4,Greyfarn," Yes. Yes, it can."
Bender's Game Part 4,Frydo," You are no match for my dragon style. [Momon breathes fire and Frydo ducks, but the fire burns his wings off.] I guess you are a match for my dragon style."
Bender's Game Part 4,Momon," Tell me, Frydo, are you aware that a dragon's one weakness is its soft underbelly?"
Bender's Game Part 4,Frydo, No. Why do you... [She leaps and bites his belly. Frydo screams in pain.]
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>Leegola, Get my friend out of your mouth.
Bender's Game Part 4,Titanius Anglesmith," It is all over, Momon. We'll soon be down there defeating you. And it's all thanks to the existence of this fragile staircase. [He laughs victoriously, then Momon stomps on the ground, causing the staircases on either side of them to disintegrate.] Whoa!"
Bender's Game Part 4,Ignus, Quick. Get on the magic bug.
Bender's Game Part 4,Greyfarn," It's not a magic bug, you dope. It's a magic arachnid. Can't you count the legs?"
Bender's Game Part 4,Ignus, No.
Bender's Game Part 4,Greyfarn," Six, seven, eight. Not six, eight. I'll kill you, you imbecile."
Bender's Game Part 4,Momon, My underbelly. My one weakness.
Bender's Game Part 4,Zoidberg Head," [He picks up the die.] I got it. Now I can throw it in the hot thing over there and be the hero. On the other hand, infinite power might be nice."
Bender's Game Part 4,Ignus," Please, I'm trying to help you."
Bender's Game Part 4,Greyfarn, Then why are you hitting me with a stick? How stupid are you that you think that's helping?
Bender's Game Part 4,Ignus, Mommy never told you about my father.
Bender's Game Part 4,Greyfarn, She said he was a foul He-demon.
Bender's Game Part 4,Ignus, Exactly. [He clicks off his lightsabre device.] You are my father.
Bender's Game Part 4,Greyfarn," No. No, that's impossible."
Bender's Game Part 4,Ignus, Search your feelings. You know it to be true.
Bender's Game Part 4,Greyfarn, No! [He hits his head with his staff.] No! [He hits his head with  the staff again.]
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>Ignus, Ya-huh! I heard Mommy say so.
Bender's Game Part 4,Zoidberg Head, [While jumping and spinning between Frydo and Momon.] I have all the dice. I am the dungeon master. I know all and see... [He is squished by the falling Greyfarn. The die rolls away from him and Momon quickly snatches it up.]
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>Momon," Game over. [She begins laughing and a purple blast expands from the Geysers of Gygax blowing the rocks around it apart. During her laugh, Momon starts coughing, but then continues laughing. The floor and pillars begin collapsing into the ground.]"
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>Frydo, No! No!
Bender's Game Part 4,Mom, What happened?
Bender's Game Part 4,Leela," My God, we're out of that weird, crazy world and back in our regular crazy world."
Bender's Game Part 4,Fry, Did we all just have some kind of freaky dream or was it ghosts?
Bender's Game Part 4,Farnsworth," Neither, Fry. It was science. Bender's mighty imagination amplified by a dark matter resonance created an alternate reality that very nearly blew our minds."
Bender's Game Part 4,Hermes, Exactly. You can't make that kind of stuff up.
Bender's Game Part 4,Mom,"  Quit trying to explain everything. I defeated you in that world and I'll defeat you in this one. Boys, the crystal’s still in his stomach."
Bender's Game Part 4,Walt, Commencing intestinal flash flood.
Bender's Game Part 4,Farnsworth," Wait! Before my moment of shame, can I..."
Bender's Game Part 4,Mom," Yes, speak up."
Bender's Game Part 4,Farnsworth, Can I give my boy a hug?
Bender's Game Part 4,Mom, All right. Fine. I've never done it. I guess somebody should.
Bender's Game Part 4,Inger, Daddy. [They hug.]
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>Farnsworth," Like father, like son, eh, boy?"
Bender's Game Part 4,Igner, We both eated the crysals. [They giggle together.]
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>Mom, No. No!
Bender's Game Part 4,Mom, My dark matter. It's worthless.
Bender's Game Part 4,Farnsworth," That's right, Mom. But fear not, fancy folk for I've just thunk up an alternative energy source. Nibbler-power."
Bender's Game Part 4,Nibbler, Hurray. Wait. What?
Bender's Game Part 4,Farnsworth, Mush! Mush! [He whips the Nibblonians.]
Bender's Game Part 4,<poem>Bender," Whip harder, Professor."
Bender's Game Part 4,Farnsworth," Faster, [Whip] faster. [Whip] Slower. [Whip]"

Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,"That was then and this is, too.",
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,"'Cause we'll still find the happening hot spots,",
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,We'll still cruise the cool casinos.,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,"You'll still fly me to the moon,",
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,"Although the moon to which you fly me,",
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Could be Phobos or Deimos.,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,"The psychic worms from Rigel Nine,",
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,"Who control everything we do,",
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,"Will make us think that was then,",
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,And 3010 is exactly the same as 1962.,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,"Don't expect any changes, my friend,",
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,"That was then and this is, too.",
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," Wow, Mars Vegas.  Long live the eternal city."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Mr. Wong," Two, one, zero!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," Rest in hell, Crapville!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Mrs. Wong," Out here in the desert, we’re gonna build bigger, better Vegas."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Mr. Wong," Bathtubs size of oceans, hookers size of bouncers."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender, [He blubbers.] Hamburger!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Worm Announcer, Stand clear of the closing jaws.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Amy Wong," So what's gonna be over there, Dad?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Mr. Wong," That? That the oasis. [A bulldozer destroys a small area of trees and grass.  A tree was missed, so a man sets it on fire with a flame thrower.]  Future site of Oasis Hotel.  [He laughs.] Take that, you stupid Mother Nature."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Frida Waterfall, Okay. Let's hit him hard.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Feministas, This land is your land.  This land is my land
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry, Who are you noisy women?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Frida," I'm Frida Waterfall, leader of the Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective, and we will not let you man-doze this beautiful gyno-desert."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Mr. Wong," Well, I'm Leo Wong, and I say, ""Boom!"""
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Frida, What happened to my femi-necklace?  And where's my mega-fem?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Farnsworth," Is he badly hurt, Dr. Zoidberg?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Zoidberg, I don't quite know how to say this. (Sobbing ) Fry is dead!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Zoidberg," Wait, not dead.  The other thing."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Mr. Wong," Damn eco-broads!  You can't even spray for eagles without upsetting these kooks.  [He sprays a tree and two eagles fall out, then a cave man falls out.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Leela," Now, hang on.  Before you do construction, don't you have to make sure you're not harming any native species?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Mr. Wong, Already done! By top scientist.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Farnsworth," Err, what?  Oh, my, yes.  You've got the go-ahead, Mr. Wong.  This place is deader than last year's cat."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Leela," No, it's not!  There's precious life right here in this scum puddle.  [He holds up a desert muck leech.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Farnsworth," Ah! The desert muck leech.  Amazingly, the entire species lives in this one tiny stink hole.  (To Mr. Wong ) Killing these will be so much easier than exterminating those ponies."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Leela," Leeches may not be cuddly like pandas or tribbles, but these poor endangered creatures deserve... [She pets the leech, it makes a noise and then it bites and clamps onto her neck.] Get off me! [She throws it to the ground.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender, I'll get it with my trusty foot cups  Stompy and Smashy.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Leela," No, don't kill it! We have to..."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Mr. Wong, There. They're not endangered anymore. They're extinct.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Leela," No, they're not. I saved this one. And I'm gonna raise it and care for it, so the world will forever know what it's lost. [The leech then bites her eye and she screams.] You freaking slime wad!  [She pulls is off her eye and stomps on it, then stops.] No. I killed it. It was the last of its kind.  [The creature comes back to life and bites onto her knee.] Let go of me, you...  [She holds her leg up and fries the leech with a laser from her Wristlomojacker.]  Poor thing."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Mr. Wong," Tell you what, Fry. You all promise not to sue me, I give you token for free entry in poker tournament. [He slips a poker chip into Fry's pocket on his shirt while Fry is still somewhat unconscious.] He took it, you all saw it!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," Maybe we did, maybe we didn't. [Leela runs across the screen behind them, battling the leech still.]  What's in it for me, Bender?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Mr. Wong," Okay, okay. Come back when New Vegas opens, I give you all free rooms, free dinner and free tickets to Celine Dion."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender, Lose the Celine Dion tickets and you got yourself a deal.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Mr. Wong," All right, damn it, done!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," All right, I scored."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Zoidberg," Look out, Vegas, I've got a system. [He inserts a quarter and pulls the lever while laughing. The rolls of the machine land on ""OUT OF ORDER,"" ""OUT OF ORDER"" and ""NO REFUNDS.""] Oh. I'm bankrupt."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry," [He chuckles.] You said it, Hermes. He is pathetic, but lovable."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Hermes," Yup. What? I said no such thing, man."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry," I am not acting weird, Leela. Why is everyone talking at once?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Leela," Fry, calm down and stop braining."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Amy," Yeah, Fry, maybe you need to-"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry," You're right, Amy! Maybe I do need some fresh air."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," Man, I'm worried about him. But not enough to stop gambling for even a single second."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Three Leos on the Machine," You win, damn it!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry, Voices always yelling. Who - who said that? I'm not insane. Stop it. Stop talking in me!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Hutch Waterfall," Voices bothering you, man? You need one of these doodangs.  [He taps on his foil hat.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry (Over the chatter)," A foil hat? Of course, he likes pastrami. What about the dog's testicles? [Hutch puts his foil hat on Fry's head and the voices quiet.] Hey, it worked. The voices stopped."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Hutch, They've got a huge selection of carburetors... Hang on. Hang on. [He searches through a dumpster for a new hat and finds one with some pizza stuck to it.] That's better. My name's Hutch.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry," Hi, Hutch. So what's with the obnoxious, shrieking voices? Are my fillings picking up The View?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Hutch," No, man. Truth is, it's other people's thoughts. You're a mind reader."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry," Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Although, actually, it was sort of obvious."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Hutch, You don't believe me? Take off the helmet.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry, I believe you.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Hutch," Seriously, do it. [Fry sighs and takes his hat off.] (Telepathically)  Testing, testing. Do you read me?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry (Telepathically), Loud and clear.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Hutch, What?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry," I said, ""Loud and clear."" Only I said it with my thinker, not my talker."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Hutch, Whoa! Freaky. Why can't I read your thoughts?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry, I don't know. Wait. What's that about a secret society?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Hutch," Never mind that. Just keep the foil on and you'll be okay. Also, it'll keep the Dark Ones from incinerating your brain."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry, That's a plus.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Hutch," And don't ever, ever, ever tell anyone you can read minds, or the Dark Ones will get you like that. [He poorly snaps his fingers.] Hang on, pizza grease. Like that. [He snaps his fingers and Fry let's out a concerned wail.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Clamps," I'd like to get my clamps on those. Give her a jump, you know what I mean?  [He laughs alone.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Donbot," Whoa, whoa. Show some decorum there, Clamps. This ain't no strip show. This is a beguiling display of the pornographic arts."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Joey Mousepad," Yo, Skip, I can see a guy's butt."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Michael's Wife," Oh, Michael, this is the perfect end to a perfect honeymoon."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Michael, I love you so much.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender, Is this seat taken?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Michael," Actually, we..."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender, Slide me those chicken wings. So what part of Podunk you rubes from?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Michael, The north-eastern.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Announcer," Monsieurs et mademoiselles, our circus of the senses now arrives by steamboat in New Orleans, circa 2873. The muted lament of a trombone resonates through the fog, which lingers even now, months after the attack of the fog monster. With but one hope of restoring Gearoticus to his throne, our sensual fate rests in the gyrations of... Fanny."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," Oh. [He stops eating and watches Fanny move her fan around on stage. He stammers and his eyes extend out of his head to zoom in. They extend out farther, then his antenna extends and the woman next to him gasps.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fanny, Yes?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender, I'm Bender. Let's do it.  [He holds out the flowers.]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Donbot," Who is it, the Feds?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," [He gasps.] Aren't you the Donbot, head of the Robot Mafia?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Donbot," Allegedly. And this is my beloved wife, Fanny, whose honor I would proudly defend with a power drill. Well, I gotta go drown a stoolie."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Donbot," I'm gonna be in here a while, so do me a favor and drive my wife home. It's one of them self-driving cars, so just sit in the back and do whatever."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fanny," Oh, Bender, your lips are intoxicating. It's like kissing an ashtray full of hot wings."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender (As if he were speaking through a fan), Aww yeahh!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry (Telepathically)," My God, I really can read minds. I have a superpower! There must be something great I can do with this."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry," Hello, ladies, I can read your thoughts. [Punches are heard and Fry is thrown out of the room.] Oh, wait, that's invisibility."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry (Telepathically)," Poker. With my mind-reading abilities and my invisibility... Wait, no, just the mind reading. I can't lose!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry," Sign me up for the tournament, please."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Administrator," Okey-doke, Jiffy Pop. Entry fee's 50,000 smackers."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry," 50,000? Drat, all I have is my life savings and a token for free admission to this poker tournament."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Administrator, Close enough. [He puts the wad of cash in his breast pocket.]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Amy, You're having an affair with the head of the robot mafia's wife?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender (Off-screen)," Yup, this is her I'm making out with."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Hermes," Bender, are you crazy?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," No, it's Fry who's crazy in this one."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry," Psht, I'm not crazy."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Leela," You sure you're okay, Fry? You do have tin foil on your head."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry," So? You've got a leech on your neck. Oh, and speaking of sucking on your neck, want to go to a movie later?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Elzar," Hey, there! How are you folks doing tonight?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender, Great. What are the specials?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Elzar, We've got a wonderful grizzly bear that's been dipped in cornmeal and lightly tormented. Questions?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Amy, What was the bear's name?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Elzar, Jojo.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Amy," Ooh, I'll have him."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender, Hide me!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Joey Mousepad," Hey, Donbot, ain't that your wife what with you had that wedding with?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fanny," [While sauntering over to Donbot looking rather bloated.] Donbot, honey! What a pleasant shock! I was just having dinner alone, when suddenly you walk in on us."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Donbot," Alone, huh?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," Where am I? I was exploring a wormhole through space many light years from this restaurant, when suddenly I was surrounded by darkness. (To Fanny ) Hot, sexy darkness. [He purrs sensually.] Oh, why, hello, Donbot! Hello, miss, have we met? [He shakes Fanny's hand.] I'm Bender. The world's most sexual robot. I mean, the world's most boundary-respecting robot."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Donbot," Nice to see you, Bender. Welcome back to our universe. Listen, sugar, I stuck up the Burlington Coat Factory and got you a little something. It's a $49 value."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Danny," Donbot, I love you! (To Bender ) Not really."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," Man, this is great! I always wanted to nail a dame in a fur coat, and now's my chance. [He catches himself.] I mean, if you'll introduce me to one, sir. (To Fanny ) One as sexy as you, baby! Bender out. [He struts away while humming/scatting. Zoom on Donbot's eyes, they squint, showing Donbot is onto Bender.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fanny," I never felt so alive, Bender. Listen, this turquoise-encrusted bra is worth 50 grand. Let's sell it and run off before the Donbot gets wise."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender, [He sighs.] No. It will take a lot more money than that to make a girl like you happy.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fanny," No, it won't."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," Yeah, it will. Shut up! We'll run off, after I win the Universal Poker Championship! [He raises his hand to reveal his plan, reaches into Fanny's bosom, rips out the bra and slams it on the Administrator's counter.] One entry, please."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fanny," Bender, no! You're not lucky enough."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," Oh, no? I'm 40% lucky. [He bangs on his chest twice.] The scrap metal I'm made from included a truckload of horseshoes from the luckiest racehorses in Mexico, who had just been sent to a glue factory."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fanny, They don't sound so lucky to me.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender, Not without their shoes.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fanny," Here, Bendy, take this. It will give you 70% more luck. It's the Donbot's lucky robot's foot."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," All right! With two kinds of luck, I can't lose."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," No, wait, three. I stepped on a leprechaun."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Joey Mousepad," Yo, you see this over here over there?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Clamps, I'm powering up the clamps.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Donbot," Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let us not rush to judgement."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Joey Mousepad," But, Skip, that was your lucky robot's foot what came off of your lucky leg."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Donbot," [He turns his chair to the side and shows his missing appendage.] While it is true that I did wake up with only one foot this morning, there is no proof that my beloved Fanny was involved. Aside from the hacksaw I found under her pillow."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Clamps," Well, what about that Bender guy? You want I should give him the clamps?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Donbot," Not yet, Clamps. We are gonna sit tight and see if he wins the poker tournament. He does, that proves he's packing my lucky foot, in which event..."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Clamps, The clamps! Or a clamp-like device.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Penn Jillette," Welcome viewers who fell asleep with the TV on! It's the 3009 no-limit hold 'em championship. [The crowd cheers.] I'm the massive head of Penn Jillette, and here with a color commentary, my partner Teller. [Teller's head is floating in his own jar. As always, he is deceased.] Our act really didn't change much when he died."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," Pardon me, I'm new to this game. Is this duffle bag big enough for all your money? [He laughs and sits down at the table.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry," [He walks up to the table.] Bender? Oh, boogers. We're in the same tournament. Quick, get your entry fee back before I bankrupt you."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," Pfft! In your dreams, nutloaf."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry, Bite my shiny metal hat.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Penn Jillette (Whispering)," Tex Connecticut, the pride of Kansas City, first to act. [He has a Queen and a Nine and calls the blinds.] Smiley Spiff, up next. [He has a Jack and a Ten and also calls.] Looks like Boobs Vanderbilt has a decent pair. Also, she's got two eights. [She calls.] And Bender Rodriguez picks up a lucky deal right off the bat. [He calls as well.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender (Telepathically), Woo! Two aces. I'm thinking guitar solo. [He mimics a guitar solo.]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry, He puts his hat back down.] I fold.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Penn Jillette, Holy crap! A stunning play by mentally ill newcomer Philip Fry. It's almost as if he knew Bender had two aces.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,'Boobs Vanderbilt, Bender has two aces? I'm out.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Tex Connecticut, I'm out.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Lrrr, I'm out.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender, [He laughs and pulls in the chips.] Suck my luck!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Donbot," See this gun? [He holds up a gun, but then he crumples it in his hand.] That's what I'm gonna do to Bender if he wins."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Lrrr," All in. Call my mighty bid at your peril. [He growls at the table. Fry lifts his hat.] (Telepathically)  My cards are awful, and I need a hug."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry, I call your bluff.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Lrrr, I shall annihilate... Fry hugs him.] (Sobbing ) I just wanted to make my daddy proud.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Lrrr's Father," Well, you didn't. I want you and your junk moved out by Monday."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Penn Jillette," It's getting pretty intense, folks. Based on the state of decomposition of Teller's head, we're now in hour 19 of the tournament. And the first bad deal of the night for Bender."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," Hey, pal, help me out here. [He holds up his cards - a Seven and a Two.] This is the worst possible hand, right?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Tex Connecticut, I'm all in.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," All in! I mean, fold. Whatever."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Penn Jillette," [Leo deals the flop.] Well, Bender's luck just ran out. No card can save him from elimination."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Boobs Vanderbilt," Oh, my gourds! He's dead. [A card falls on her as well.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Leo Wong," 21, winner! [He pushes the chips to Bender.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," Wooo! I'm so full of luck, it's shooting out like luck diarrhoea."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Penn Jillette," Wake up, poker fans! We're down to our final two players in heads-up action for the Championship. Your perspective, Teller? [A rat eats Teller's left eye.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender, All in.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry," But-but, you didn't even look at your cards!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender, Looking at one's cards is a crutch for players who rely on skill.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Leo Wong," Any day now, Fry. You in or out?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," What's the matter, Fry, you scared? Or just [He spins his head around and wiggles in fingers] crazy? [He laughs.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry," All right, all in. [Leo deals the cards.] Yes! Four aces!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," [Fry moves in to take the pot.] Ah-ah-ah. Read 'em and weep, and then tell me what they are."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Leo Wong," Two kings. And with three on the board, that gives Bender five kings."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fry, But how is that...
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Penn Jillette," I don't believe it. Bender has just been dealt the King of Beers, a coaster from the bar that somehow got mixed into the deck. But it still counts!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Leo Wong, Bender win the Championship!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender, [He eats the money.] That's some good money. [He then belches fire.]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Fanny," [She comes running over with a suitcase.] You did it, Bender. You're the greatest."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," Tell me something I don't know, sweetass. Now, let's boogie. We'll be in Space Tahiti before the Donbot knows what hit him."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Donbot, Now I am suspicious.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,Bender," Okay, we finished digging this shallow grave. Can we go now?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Hermes and Zoidberg," Previously, on Futurama. [they clink champagne glasses labelled ""matter"" and ""anti-matter"" together, causing an explosion]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Hutch, You need one of these doodangs.  [He taps on his foil hat.]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry (Over chatter), A foil hat? [Hutch puts his foil hat on Fry's head and the voices quiet.]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Hutch," Truth is, you're a mind reader."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry," Oh, my God!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Amy, You're having an affair with the head of the robot mafia's wife? [Bender and Fanny are seen making out]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Bender," Okay, we finished digging this shallow grave."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry (Sobbing), Poor Bender left me one last voicemail before the Robot Mafia buried him in the desert.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Bender (On cell phone)," Fry, old friend, before I die, I just wanted to say... [Beep.] Hang on, I'm getting another call. Hello? [The gun fire commences and Bender screams.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Hermes," Line up, people! Everyone take a shovel and one sixth of the planet. We'll meet back here in 50 years, our bodies broken and our lives wasted."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Zoidberg, And you say these are free shovels?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Bender," I'm back, baby."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry, Bender! I thought the Robot Mafia killed you.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Bender," Nah, they just shot us and buried us a few times as a warning."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fanny, Bender was so brave. He never stopped making out with me the whole time they were shooting us.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Bender, I sure didn't.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fanny," I gotta get back to my husband, baby. Will I see you tonight?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Bender, Probably not.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong," It's a 14-footer with a clown hazard. What club you recommend, Baggy?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Baggy," As on every hole, I suggest the putter."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry," Your golf club sure is classy, Mr. Wong. Naked statue classy."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela," It is very nice. I just wish Amy and I didn't have to wear these sexist badges on our melons. [They stand up and show their badges that say ""WOMAN.""]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Amy," We're lucky even to play as guests, Leela. Dad's club has a very strict ""No girls allowed"" policy."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela, That doesn't seem fair.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Amy, It really is. Everybody knows women don't have the focus to play miniature golf at a professional level.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela, But that's the best shot of the day!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong, Is that my ball? I think that my ball.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Amy," Pfft, great putt, Dad."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong," Okay, we're done."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela," Mr. Wong, how do you keep this place so green in the middle of the desert? Doesn't that waste a lot of water?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong," Nah, we got plenty water, pumped directly from flamingo lake. [The flamingos sitting in the lake are sucked into the drain with all of the water.] They'll be fine. [Pink feathers are expelled from the sprinklers.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong," Oh, yeah, I love miniature golf. Love everything about it, except how damn miniature it is. That's why I'm building the universe's biggest miniature golf course."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong, This the first tee.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry, Where's the hole?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong," On Pluto's moon, Hydra. It's a six-billion-mile par-two. Tough shot, even for a man. [Leela groans. Mr. Wong adjusts the cannon with a dial near the tee. He strikes the button that fires the ball and everybody rushes over to a row of binoculars.] (Leo VO)  Around the sun. Bank off Jupiter. And right into the... [The ball lands short of the hole and Mr. Wong curses in Mandarin.] I'll be right back. [He gets in a golf cart that has a dome over it and flies to Hydra. Fry, Leela and Amy watch from the binoculars. Mr. Wong smacks the giant ball his his putter, but it stops on the edge of the hole. He growls and curses in Mandarin. He bounces over to the ball and smacks his with his putter again, then kicks it.] It dropped in! Put me down for a two."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Amy, Two. [She writes down 8.]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong," Keep in mind, that just the first hole. For full course, we gonna bulldoze this entire arm of the Milky Way."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela, What? You're gonna wipe out 10% of the galaxy for a stupid golf course?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong," First of all, it 12% . Second, yes, you betcha."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela, But you have no idea what life forms might be evolving out there.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong, That's exactly why I'm hiring an impartial scientist to perform an environmental survey. That's him in the money shower.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry (VO)," Delivery boy's log. Having fallen asleep on what I thought was the toilet, I awoke to find the environmental survey in progress."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Farnsworth," Status reports, Science Officer."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Bender, Zilcho. No sign of life or intelligence. [He laughs.] (Telepathically)  Just like Fry on a date.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry, [He laughs.] Hey!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela," Okay, so we haven't found any life yet. I still don't see why you men can't be happy with regular-sized miniature golf."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Farnsworth," Leela, evolution has programmed our fabulous male brains to take anything anybody else thinks is important and make it bigger. [He takes a slurp of a ""128oz. Big Burp.""] Have you seen my new 301-inch TV?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Announcer, Hypnotoad is brought to you by the MagnaPhallix 302-inch TV. It's bigger!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Farnsworth," Oh, hell! [He throws his beverage at the TV and it falls apart.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Bender," [An alarm sounds.] Captain, I'm detecting life on the Spock-o-scope!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela, It's amazing. It's like a textbook on evolution.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry, Except in Kansas.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Bender, But isn't Mr. Wong building the 18th hole here? And the golf pants museum?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Farnsworth, Indeed so. This whole area will be incinerated when he implodes that sun there into a black hole.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela, That beautiful violet star?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Farnsworth, It's so you can't keep your ball at the end of the game.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry," Yo, that's messed up."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela," There won't be any imploding once they read our environmental review. Right, Professor?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Farnsworth," Ohh, twaddle-squat. There's no scientific consensus that life is important."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Bender," Yeah. Life, schmife."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Clip Board, [Farnsworth checks an option.] Approved for demolition.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela," It's you and me, ponytail. [He cracks her pony tail like a whip.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Guard," We're here, Mr. President."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Richard Nixon's head, Arroo! Let's play some mini-golf.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nixon," Just give it a light tap, Agnew. [Agnew pulls his club up high.] No, no, no, just a light..."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Zoidberg," Now for a triple clam dip, with a double - [The ball smashes into his head and knocks him on his back.] OW! [He falls off the diving board and lands on the concrete surrounding the pool.] OW!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nixon," Tough luck, Agnew. Looks like you and Wong owe me a Charleston Chew.  [He laughs.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Feministas, Shut up and hear our wisdom. Save the ecosystem. Shut up and hear our wisdom!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nixon," What gives, Wong? You said no chicks allowed."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Frida," We are the Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective, and we will not let you...What was it again?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela," We will not let you implode the violet dwarf star at galactic coordinates 167.84, -58.03, mark 948."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong," Already approved, you cackling hens. So get out, or I'll have vice-president Agnew's headless body throw you out."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela, I'd like to see him try.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nixon," Me, too. Should look funny. Sic 'em, Agnew."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nixon, Runaway golf cart!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela," Look out, Agnew!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nixon, Whoa!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong, Aah!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela, Is... is he okay?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong, No pulse.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nixon, They killed the headless remains of Agnew. Arrest them!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Frida," All Feministas she-vacuate the premises. I mean ""femises."""
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nixon," My fellow Earthicans, these eco-crooks will face the maximum sentence. For killing a headless torso, that's six weeks."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Bender," Well, this is embarrassing. Here I've been blabbing on for years about killing all humans, and who actually does something about it? Some chick."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry," Leela's not a killer, and she's not some chick. She's the chick I love. And don't tell her I called her a chick, or she'll kill me."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Frida (through her megaphone), Everyone stay absolutely quiet!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Feminista, That thing's on. Shh!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Feminista, Turn it off!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Frida (through megaphone)," Oh, sorry."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Frida, How do you turn it off?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Frida (through megaphone), There. Did that do it?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,OTHERS, No. Stop it. Shut up.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Frida, Here's the button here. [An alarm starts wailing from the megaphone.] (Through megaphone)  And I think I... Now I got it.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela, Let me give you a hand.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Frida, This is awful. I never meant for our protest to have any effect.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Trixie, Maybe we should just surrender and serve our six weeks in jail.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Dixie," Hey, yeah! We could do each other's toenails and make shivs."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela," That's crazy. We've done nothing wrong, other than killing and dismembering the vice-president. We need to make a choice, sisters. We can either keep pestering criminals like Leo Wong with silly slogans..."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,ALL, Yeah. Let's do that.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela," Actually, I meant that to be the less preferable alternative. We can either chant slogans or we can take action."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Dixie, What was the first choice again?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela, I choose to save the environment by sabotaging Leo Wong's golf course. Who's with me?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Frida, Could we still use our bullhorns?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela, Absolutely. Bullhorns are a core principle of eco-feminism.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Frida, Then I'm in.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela, Who's ready to kick some sweaty man-butt?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Dixie, I've got my pointy man-kicking shoes on.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Trixie, Those are cute.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Dixie, Aren't they? I got them at Nine West.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela," Simmer down, warriors. Full power to the vagyroscope!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong," Those dirty rings. I tried soaking them out, even blasting them out."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Frida, Are you sure about this? It would be better for propaganda if we weren't using refined sugar.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela, It's okay. The potato we're shoving in the tailpipe is organic.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong," I smell sabotage. [He sniffs.] Ooh, and potatoes."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela," Now, unfortunately, the media is going to put a negative spin on this, like when we killed that guy, so to win public support, we'll need a lovable mascot."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Zoidberg,"  [He picks it up and laughs.] Squirm all you want, you nasty dumpling. One less species for the universe, one more breakfast for..."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela, Zoidberg?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Zoidberg, Leela. Me saving things the leech. Not the eating of it.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela," Zoidberg, I'm very surprised at you, slightly."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry, Psst! Leela.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela, Shh! I'm a fugitive.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry," I know. I miss you so much, Leela, even more than when you were here."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela," I miss you, too, Fry. And you probably think what I'm doing is wrong. But it's something I really care about..."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry," You don't have to explain, Leela. You're you. That's all I need to know."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela," Goodbye, sweet goofbag."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Bender,"  [He sighs.] I'll miss her, too, buddy. Dibs on her iPod."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Zoidberg, Dibs on her- ohh...
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Hutch," Hey, Fry! Long time, man."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry," Hey, Hutch! What have you been up to?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Hutch," Same old, same old. Searching the dumpsters, protecting my thoughts with tin foil, peeing myself."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry," So, what brings you to Earth?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Hutch," It's top secret. Hey, take off your helmet and I'll think it to you."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry, Okay. Here goes.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry, Where are you? And me?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Hutch," The Great Hall of the Ancient Legion of Madfellows. Welcome, bro."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,ALL," Welcome, bro."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Hutch," Sorry I bashed your head in, buddy, but I had to. You see, the fate of the universe depends on you."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry," Yeah, I get that a lot."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Hutch, The Grand Curator will tell you more.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry, Take me to him.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nine," Hey, man."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry, Hey.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nine," So dig this, Fry. Our commune has been monitoring the universe's life energy for, like, a really long time, and we're grokking some super weird junk."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry," Um, I don't mean to be rude, but it's kind of hard to take you seriously when you say junk like ""grok"" and ""junk."""
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nine ," What about ""commune""?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry," Especially ""commune."" Come on, it's the fate of the universe, puff it up a little. Like you could say your ancient order is sensing deep upheaval in the cosmic life energy field."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nine," Okay. I'll try. So, like, a really, really long time ago... [Fry motions ""longer"" with his hands.] Eons ago! [Fry gives a thumbs up and he giggles.] Cool. Eons ago, the life force we call Chee permeated the universe. [He presses a button and a hologram is shown in the room.] The Green Chee generated a great upwelling of life across the cosmos. But then, for reasons unknown..."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry," Ooh. ""Reasons unknown."" Now that's the sort of hook that grabs the attention of me, the viewer."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nine, For reasons unknown...
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry, Nice.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nine," ...the Chee began to recede, and the diversity of life began to wither. The life forms we know today are but a fraction of a fraction of the magnificence that once existed."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Hutch," But a bunch of dudes, right, they totally passed this far-out knowledge down through the ages."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nine (VO)," Some with this knowledge were called prophets, some, fruitcakes. We, the Legion of Madfellows, are their heirs."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry," Hey, I'm on TV. [He waves.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nine," Well, that's the show. [He turns off the hologram.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry, Neat. What's it got to do with me?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nine," Ahh, pooperdoodle! I mean, pardon the omission. You see, after untold eternities, we have sensed a resurgence in the Chee."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry," Hey, that's the violet dwarf star that Leela wants to save."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Hutch," Freaking nailed it, corndog."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nine," We believe this star heralds a new green age, and it's your destiny to be its shepherd and protector."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry, Me? Why?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Hutch," 'Cause you got, like, no delta brainwave, man. The Dark Ones can't groove off your thoughts."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nine," Silence, Hutch! For now, let's just say we have enemies, enemies who can read minds, except yours. [He points with his foot.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry, Cool. I can't wait to tell Leela.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nine," No! If you tell anyone, then their thoughts could be read. For the sake of those you love, you must keep this secret. Do you foot-swear?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry," Oh, okay. I foot-swear."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nine," Good. Now, to save the coming of the green age, you must stop this man."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry, I know him. Leo Wong. I work with his daughter.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nine," Oh, good, that will cut about 15 minutes of explanation. You must gain Wong's confidence, infiltrate his organization and prevent him from destroying the violet dwarf."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong," Looking for a job, eh?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry," Yes, sir. Nothing fancy. I'm willing to start at the bottom and infiltrate my way up."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,'Mr. Wong," Sorry, no openings right now. (Telepathically)  What I need is security guard to keep nutcases out of my office."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry, I'm good at keeping nutcases.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong, I said no way. (Telepathically)  This idiot don't look like he could handle those feministas.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry, I look like an idiot who can handle those feministas.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr Wong (Telepathically), He'll have to do better than that.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry, I'll have to do better than that.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong, Hmm. You and I think a lot alike. You really think you can stand up to those eco-freakos?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Fry," Sir, with me around, they'll be the least of your worries."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Tester," Stand by, men. And manly aliens. Prepare to test fire King Kong hole."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Sal, It workses.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Tester," Good job, men. And manly aliens. Construction of King Kong hole complete."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Frida," Typical. Always King Kong, never Queen... Quong."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Sal," What are those, hooks? Get out of heres, you hookers."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Sal, [He's flying through space.] Helpses!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela," You go, gorilla !"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Morbo, Our top story. The string of eco-vandalism that began with a harmless vice-presidential killing has spread across the galaxy.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Linda," Why do you always get to read the top story, Morbo?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Morbo," Because viewers trust a deep male voice and huge, throbbing forehead veins. [They pulse in unison a few times.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Linda, Not all reaction to the crime spree has been negative. We spoke with several people who viewed these courageous eco-feminists as heroes.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Petunia, I just wish there was some way to... Excuse me. [She coughs roughly.] Some way to show I support 'em. Send them some smokes or something.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Linda, This just in  Root 2 News has received a video communique from the eco-feminists' unknown hideout.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Leela," This is sub-commander L., with a message for Leo Wong. Leo, you're a parasite on the universe, and parasites must be destroyed. That's why we've adopted this parasite as our mascot. [The leech snarls against the glass of its case.] I know it's a little confusing. The point is, even this vicious leech has a right to exist. And that's why a vicious leech like Leo Wong must be exterminated. [The Feministas in the background cheer.] Again, confusing. Feministas unite! [They pound their breasts twice and throw their fists into the air while reciting that last bit.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Morbo, In other news- [Linda throws her high heel at his head and it becomes lodged in his head.]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Linda, Feministas unite!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Linda (on the TV), Feministas unite! [The image is paused.]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nixon, Incredible. Absolutely incredible. You're telling me this TiVo machine can pause and rewind live TV?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong," These crazy broads gonna ruin me, Nixon. You gotta help me. Send the army or something. Something big that shoots."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nixon," Sir, I don't care if you are my biggest contributor. Our armed forces do not serve your private business interests."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Mr. Wong," Sorry, I..."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nixon," [He laughs hysterically.] I'm just yanking your chain, Leo. I'm on it like boring on Gerry Ford."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Zapp Brannigan," Zapp Brannigan purporting for duty. For the love of God, Kif, less piccolo, more fife."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Nixon," Report, Brannigan."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Zapp," Mr. President, I failed to identify these curvaceous banditas despite hours of staring at their dossiers. [There is a picture of Leela from behind on the cover of the file folder.] Yet, I seemed to have stroked myself upon good luck, for a patriot of the highest order has volunteered to lead us to them."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,Bender, Hey-oh!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 2,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela," Previously, on Futurama."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine," You must gain Wong's confidence, infiltrate his organization and prevent him from destroying the violet dwarf. [during this line images of Fry talking to Wong and of the violet dwarf are seen.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Hutch, The fate of the universe depends on you.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," Yeah, I get that a lot."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela, It's amazing. It's like a textbook on evolution.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry, Except in Kansas.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Mr. Wong, I smell sabotage.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela, Feministas unite! [They pound their breasts twice and throw their fists into the air while reciting that last bit.]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zapp, A patriot of the highest order has volunteered to lead us to them.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Bender, Hey-oh!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nixon, These eco-feminists are ruthless criminals who'll stop at nothing to save the environment. I don't see how a bending unit can catch them.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Bender," Not just any bending unit, Presidente. I happen to be brilliant, fearless and short on cash. [He coughs and motions for money with his fingers.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nixon," Slush him, Kroker."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zapp," Bender here has identified the femdito commander as my ex-lover, Turanga Leela, whom I once made love at."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nixon, And he's willing to fink her out for a few simoleons?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Bender," It's not about the money, Nixon, though I'd like much more. She's committed 30 felonies in 12 star systems. If no one stops her, she'll break my record for longest rap sheet."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nixon," That's a despicable motive, Bender, and I respect it."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Bender," Gracias. Now, I could find Leela, but you'll need to authorize a wiretap."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nixon, As many as you like.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Bender, I only need one.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nixon, Let's call it six.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," Hey, Bender, check it out. I'm Leo Wong's new security guard. I got an ID badge and a flashlight, and I ordered this mustache."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Bender," Neat. Say, speaking of whatever the hell you just said, I need to make a cell phone telephone call. Can borrow your cell phone telephone?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," Okay, but don't restart my Tetris. I was finally about to get one of those pieces that looks like a backwards ""L."""
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Bender," Okay, superstud."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Mr. Wong," Looking good, security. No feministas getting past you."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," No, sir. Not on my mustache's watch."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Amy," Fry, I can't believe you're working with my dad against Leela. How can you claim to be her friend and still want her in jail?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Mr. Wong, Don't mind cranky-pants here. She been cranky ever since she was a fat little girl.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Amy, Dad!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Mr. Wong," Can I be brutally honest, Fry? I always wanted a son."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," That hurt, but I can take it."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Amy, I knew you wanted a son! Why do you think I became a miniature golf champion? Why do you think I wear these stupid boys' sweat suits?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Mr. Wong," To hide your big, fat butt, that's why. [He giggles.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," Now, sir, in fairness, Amy's butt is actually pretty hot."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Amy, What is it with you men? Why does everything revolve around my butt?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Mr. Wong, 'Cause it's so big and massive. He and Fry share a laugh.]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry, Sorry.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Amy, That's it!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Bender, Whoa! What's with Big Butt?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Mr. Wong, She just hungry.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Bender," Here you go, Fry."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry, Thanks.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Bender," Oh! FYI, I dropped that Tetris piece in the wrong place and ended the game."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," [He looks at the screen on the phone. It reads ""GAME OVER.""] No!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," Great! Now Amy's gonna tell Leela I'm a jerk. If only I could explain I'm on a secret mission against evil. Wait. Evil? Yeah, yeah, evil. [There is a tapping in the darkness. Fry shines his flashlight around.] What's going on in there? A scary noise? [He spots Frida hammering a protest sign into the grass.] Hey, you're one of Leela's feministas. ""Save the environment! Wo-mandate Leo's retirement!"" That's terrible writing! Stop making your point so ineffectively! [He tries to pull the hammer from Frida's grip.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Frida, Take your mands off of me!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry, [He shushes her.] I'm on your side.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Frida, [She shushes back.] Don't shush me.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," Please, can you take a message to Leela?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Frida, [She quickly shushes him.] What is it?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," Just say her sweet goofbag is working to save the violet dwarf star, just like she is."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Frida," Very well, I'll fem-municate your man-formation."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry, [He rolls his eyes.] Just tell her.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Farnsworth," Well, this is it, old friends. Planet Express is done for, what with our delivery crew missing and the abysmal sales of Tickle Me Bender."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Bender Doll," [He doll giggles.] Quit touching my junk, pervert!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Farnsworth, Hold out your hands and I'll remove your career chips.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zoidberg, I hate to see it come to an end. [His chip is removed and he screams in agony.] When will it end?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Hermes," Shouldn't you get that, Professor?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Farnsworth," I suppose. [He walks off screen, but then rushes back to remove the career chip from Hermes' hand.] Hello?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Mr. Wong," Professor, old buddy, I'm gonna blow up the violet dwarf star. So I need you deliver billion-mile security fence to keep out protesters. Dirty business. Lot of money. You corrupt enough?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Farnsworth," Damn skippy! [Money is dispensed from the telephone console.] Good news, crybabies! We're back in business."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Hermes," Sweet kookaburra of Edinburgh, Professor. You sure you know how to fly this thing?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Farnsworth," I invented it, didn't I? You wouldn't ask Thomas Edison whether he knew how to use a sexmatron."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela, Halt! What are you doing in this parallelogram of space?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Farnsworth, We're delivering a fence to keep you ladies in your place. [He chuckles.]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zoidberg, Amy?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Hermes, Labarbara?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,LaBarbara," That's right, husband. From now on, you make your own Manwiches."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Mrs. Wong, That was the greatest play I ever saw. It must have had 20 acts.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela (over Megaphone)," We installed your fence, Leo Wong."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Linda, Should we shout a clever slogan?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela," You mean something like, ""The best defense is a good fence?"""
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Linda," Yeah, something like that, only funny."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela," I wish we could, but our chief slogan writer is back at the Honeybun Hideout."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Frida," Does ""violet dwarf"" rhyme with ""men are dorks""? It does through a megaphone. (Telepathically)  That reminds me, I've got to tell Leela about that weirdo who wants to save the violet dwarf."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Mysterious Voice," So, the Legion of Madfellows has a new pawn, eh?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Frida," Is somebody here? If you're the DSL guy, you're two days late."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Mysterious Voice, Who gave you that message for Leela?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Frida, I don't know his name.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Mysterious Voice, Then you are of no use to the Dark Ones!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Frida," Long lost brother, avenge my death."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,[Scene, Wongminister Miniature Golf Club. Fry is locking up.]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," Six, seven, eight. Lock the gate. One, two, three. Turn the key. 30, 50, 10. [He sees Hutch.] My dirty, shifty friend?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Hutch," Hey, Fry, long time."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Hutch," Welcome back to the Legion of Madfellows, man."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," Why'd you bonk me, you idiot? You could have just asked me to come with you. And where are we? This doesn't look like your regular dumpster."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine," All in good time! I guess now is a good time. We're on Mars, in a forgotten cavern abandoned by the native Martians a million years ago."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," Actually, it was five years ago. I remember 'cause they washed my socks."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine," You have done well, Fry. You have ingratiated yourself with Leo Wong."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," Yup, I kissed his ass from cheek to shining cheek. So, what do I do next?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine," As Wong security chief, you will be on hand when he attempts to destroy the violet dwarf. You must not let that happen."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," [He is taking notes.] ""Must let happen."""
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine, Not happen!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," ""Must let occur."""
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine, Let me tell you a story. A story of two alien species so ancient that compared to them the human race is a mere college senior! On a distant planetoid they evolved to cooperate in their quest to survive.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," Cooperation, because life is a team sport."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine," But, over time, one species evolved a better strategy, and an evolutionary arms race began."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine, That concludes the audio-visual portion of our head-clonk and lecture.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," Wait, what happened to the snakes and the frogs? I need to know!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine," [He sighs and turns the hologram back on. He uses the light to cast shadows on the wall his his hands.] The frogs, or possibly the snakes, evolved into vicious killing machines, honed by the merciless forces of natural selection and intelligent design. We call these the Dark Ones!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine," Meanwhile, however, the second species evolved to fend off the Dark Ones, befriending and protecting all other living things."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry, Even Celine Dion?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine," Probably. We call these noble beings the Encyclopods, because their DNA incorporates the DNA of every endangered species they encountered, so they can recreate them if they go extinct."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," Just as a pillow, a wig and a corncob pipe can be used to recreate my old girlfriend!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine, Bingo.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Transition Announcer," Meanwhile, at the Honeybun Hideout."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Labarbara, Now you know how it feels to be locked up in a go-go cage.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Hermes, What the hell are you talking about?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Labarbara, Shut your man-hole.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Hermes, I feel dirty.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela," Are you sure Fry is working for your father? It just doesn't seem like him to be so evil, or to hold down a job."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Amy," It's true, Leela. Cross My Heart bra and swear to Goddess."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela," But the Fry I know wouldn't do that. I'm gonna call his cell phone telephone and prove you wrong. [She walks over to a phone booth and tries to open the door. The camera pans down and reveals Frida's body is blocking the door.]  Oh, no! Frida's been murdered!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Labarbara, Sweet she-cattle of Seattle.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Hermes (from off screen)," Not your strong suit, woman."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Amy, Who could have done this?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela, Your dad? Nixon?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Amy, Fry?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela," No, never. I don't think. Anyhow, there's a crazed murderer on the loose, possibly in the shadows or hanging from the ceiling. [They all scream.] So just stay calm while I call Fry."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry, So where are the Encyclopods and the Dark Ones now?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine," Wh-... [Hutch is cooking a can of food with the light of the hologram.] When the life-giving Chee receded, only the toughest organisms could adapt and survive, like the Dark Ones. [The Madfellows boo.] Many more died out, like the Encyclopods. But, and this is the great secret of our age, we believe they left an egg behind."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry, Is it edible?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine," We're not gonna eat it! Not unless we find a second one. No, Fry, we intend to hatch it!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Hutch, And that's where you come in.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry, And here I am.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine," At long last the tide of Chee has returned, and its nourishing flow has awakened the dormant egg."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry, That's good.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Hutch," It's better than good. It's better. With its massive stash of DNA, the Encyclopod can reconstruct every species that ever went extinct."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," So, where is this egg?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine, In the violet dwarf star system.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry, And what does it look like?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine, A violet dwarf star!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," You mean, the whole star is a single... Whoa! Sci-fi."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine," Alas! Even now, a Dark One is headed to the star to ensure its destruction."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry, Dang! So what does this Dark One look like?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine, [He sighs.] We don't know. I admit it's a horrifically grave situation.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Hutch," Don't sugarcoat it, Nine. The Dark Ones have been evolving so long, it could be anything or anyone. Or anybody."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," You mean, like, people?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Hutch," Any people. It will kill the egg, and every dude, woman and child who knows about it."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Nine," Even our crazy caps will be useless at close range. That's why only you, with your defective unreadable brainwave, may be able to thwart them and usher in a new green age of wonder and..."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry, You're on Fry-time. Leela! Did you get my message?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela, What message?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry, Didn't you see Frida Waterfall?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela, [She gasps.]So you did kill Frida Waterfall?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," What? No. I told her to tell you that I'm... Oh, Jeep! The Dark Ones got her. It's all true. We need to talk, Leela. Then I can explain... [Nine motions ""No!""] Well, I can't explain anything, but we should talk anyway. Where are you?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela," Oh, no. I'm not gonna expose the Honeybun Hideout. Where are you?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry, Near the Keeler Crater on Mars. Do you know it?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela," I, I, uh... I think I read about it."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela, [She is heard through a speaker on the Nimbus.] I'll meet you at the south rim in one hour. No moustaches.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zapp," Kif, set coordinates, 36-24-36. AKA, Leela."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry, Ten minutes late. Ain't that just like a womanista?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela, Psst. Are you alone?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," Of course, don't you trust me?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zapp (over PA)," There's no escape, Leela. If you surrender, wave your shirt in the air."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela," Fry, you traitor!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Amy (over PA)," Hop onto the magnet, Leela!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela," Okay. One, two... [Her boots are pulled to the magnet. She screams and Fry laughs, but he is grabbed by the ears and pulled along with her. The Planet Express ship takes off with the Nimbus chasing after it.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela," [She throws him in the go-go cage.] I can't believe you ratted me out, Fry."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," I'm not a rat, I swear. If I'm any rodent, it's the loyal capybara, king of the rats! No, wait."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Amy," Stay strong, ladies. We can lose them in the giant miniature golf course."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry, But the course isn't finished. And there's no girls allowed.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Amy, Fore! [She pulls the steering wheel to the right with her club.]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zapp," So, they want to play mini golf, eh? Two can play at that game. Or even four, depending on the number of ball colors available."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zapp, I choose pink.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Kif," That's their color, sir."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zapp, The hell it is.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela, They're gaining on us. We need a birdie on the windmill hole.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Amy, Wait. Wait. Drop the boot!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Kif," Sir, at our present speed, the computer predicts a 100% chance we'll be sliced in half. We'll never make it."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zapp," Not with that attitude, we won't. Same speed ahead!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zapp," We made it through, Kif. How many men did we lose?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Kif, All of them.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zapp," Well, at least they won't have to mourn each other. Seal the airlocks, and draw the shades. Resume shooting."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," Oh, no! The gorilla! That's a par-four!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela, The mouth's too dangerous. I'm going for the nose.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Amy, Don't be a sucker. You won't come out anywhere near the hole. You need to aim for the jaws just when they start to close.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela, Start to close? Are you out of your...
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela, We made it!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zapp, Captaining 101 . Go for the nose.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Bender," My arms are broken, I'll never paint again. [He starts crying.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Kif, You can't sue the military.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Bender, I'm okay then.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zapp, Damage report.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Kif," We lost all remaining food and oxygen, Captain. As well as our XM Radio antenna."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zapp," Then this chase is over. Kif, set course for the nearest XM repair facility. Meanwhile, we shall sing top hits from the '80s."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Kif," Which '80s, sir?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zapp," For me, there are only one '80s. [The ships slowly heads away from the chase.] (VO)  Smell like I sound, [Kif groans.] I'm lost and I'm found. [Kif groans.]And I'm hungry like the wolf."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Hermes, The shot was too good! We're jamming straight for the hole.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zoidberg," We're gonna crash, even."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Amy," Shmeesh, shmill out, shmeverybody. It's a wormhole hole."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Farnsworth," Of course, a wormhole! We'll simply disappear and reappear in a... [They enter the wormhole.] ...nother part of the universe."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Amy, We made it!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Farnsworth," Uh, whaa..."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela, Crud nuggets! We de-spaced right next to the Nimbus.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zoidberg," Just when you think the chase is over, it gets twice as exciting!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Bender," Hey, look at that."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zapp," Well, well, well. My bloodhound-like instincts must have hunted them down while my other parts were throbbing to Duran Duran."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Kif, Shall I initiate a pointless and potentially fatal pursuit?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zapp, Make it so.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Bender," It's gonna be fun on a bun, in space."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela, Look! The asteroid. Now it's crawling with life. Like Zoidberg's sandals!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry, Wow! It's incredible.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela, But it'll be destroyed when Leo Wong blows up the violet dwarf. So why are you helping him?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," I can't tell you, Leela. You just have to trust me."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela," You keep saying that, but you have to give me something to go on or I..."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Planet Express Ship Alarm, Out of whale oil. Out of whale oil.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela, [She gasps.] The out-of-fuel indicator. It's indicating.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zoidberg," Say, what's that violet-colored dwarf-like star thing we're drifting into?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela, The violet dwarf star!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Fry," Of course. The gorilla was the 18th hole, so we're headed into the ball return."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zoidberg," Aye, what else now can go wrong?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zapp," [on the monitor] Ladies, you're under arrest. Prepare to be boarded again and again."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Petunia, He'll never take me alive. [She starts hacking up smoke.]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela, Don't give up yet. I've got one more trick up my sleeve.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Amy, That's exactly the number we need.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zapp," Ah, the fairer sex."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Zapp," Something's very wrong here, and yet a little bit right."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela (off-screen)," Not so fast, Brannigan. [All nine of them have guns.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Bender (off-screen)," Even less fast, feministas! [He has a gun that controls nine other guns.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Leela, Bender?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Bender," All two tons of me, and if you think that's shocking; wait 'til you see w..."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,Transition Announcer [interrupting]," Tune in next time on Futurama! [""TO BE CONTINUED..."" appears on the screen]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 3,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry," Previously, on Futurama."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Hutch," Truth is, you're a mind reader."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry," Oh, my God!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela," Leeches may not be cuddly like pandas or tribbles, but these poor endangered creatures deserve... [She pets the leech, it makes a noise and then it bites and clamps onto her neck.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Nine," You must gain Wong's confidence, infiltrate his organization and prevent him from destroying the violet dwarf. [during this line images of Fry talking to Wong and of the violet dwarf are seen.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Hutch, The fate of the universe depends on you.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry," Yeah, I get that a lot."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela, It's amazing. It's like a textbook on evolution.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry, Except in Kansas.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mr. Wong, I smell sabotage.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela, Feministas unite! [They pound their breasts twice and throw their fists into the air while reciting that last bit.]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela (off-screen)," Not so fast, Brannigan. [All nine of the feministas have guns.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Bender (off-screen)," Even less fast, feministas! [He has a gun that controls nine other guns.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Bailiff," Oye, oye, oye. All rise for the honorable Chief Justice D-O-G-G and the Associate Justices."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Snoop Dogg's head," Yo. Seat it or beat it. The charges against y'all femditos is murder, mayhem, vandalism, kidnapping and resisting arrest. Damn! The big five. You may now make your opening ""what you got to say for yourselves."""
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela," May it please the Court... [Judge Dogg slams his gavel.] I mean, may it plizzle the cozizzle."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Dogg, Proceed.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela," These charges are outrageous. Our only goal was to save a rare violet star and its precious ecosystem. If protecting the environment is a crime, then..."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Judge Dogg, Protecting the environment is a crime.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela', [She clears her throat.] I rest my mouth.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Bailiff, Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Nixon," I... Well, now, I... Am I under oath when I take the oath?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Ruth Bader Ginsburg's head, Can the witness identify the feminista leader?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Bender," That's her right there, with the ""I'm gonna kill you Bender"" look in her eye."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Antonin Scalia's head," Hey, aren't you the robot who robbed me at gunpoint last year?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Bender," No further answers, Your Honor."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry," Please, Justice Dogg, Leela and her friends are completely innocent."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Dogg, Hold up. Were you or were you not abducted by these hoes?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry," Well, abducted is such an ugly word."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Clarence Thomas' head," Mr. Wong, the court cannot compel you to testify against your own daughter."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mr. Wong," No. No, I want to. Also, I got something to say about my wife."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Dogg," Aw, yeah. Having heard some of the testimony over these jams I've been listening to, me and my crew will now kick it in the mix."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Dogg," A'ight. We got us a verdict up in this High Court. Bailiff, drop it like it's legal precedent."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Bailiff," In the matter of Leo Wong v. The Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective, four justices vote to convict, five to acquit."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Scalia," However, since the vote was strictly along gender lines and the female justices' votes only count half, you are hereby found guilty."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Ginsburg," It's a humiliating and biased system, but it works."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Dogg, Fifty years in the maximum security Dogg house. [He bangs his gavel.]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Warden, Ladies! Welcome to hell.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Petunia, Beats Nutley on a Saturday night.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Warden," This is a privately-owned for-profit prison and I run a tight, cheap ship! I've done this by cutting cost everywhere, especially on punishment. I rely on you inmates to make prison unpleasant for yourselves. You're encouraged to sexually harass new prisoners, organize no-holds-barred catfights and maintain poor hygiene."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Amy," Try and make me, copper."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Warden, Oh... a troublemaker. [She laughs.] Taste the lash of my 99-cent-store nightstick!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mr. Wong," Yee-ha! With the feministas in jail, it full speed ahead. You and me, Fry. We implode the violet dwarf star tomorrow. Ka-boom-boom."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry, You and me?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mr. Wong, Yeah.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry, Tomorrow?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mr. Wong, Tomorrow.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry, Ka-boom?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mr. Wong, Ka-boom-boom.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry," Hello? Madfellows? I need to- [He is hit on the head with a bottle and passes out. Small time lapse and he awakens.] Okay, Leo Wong's about to destroy the violet dwarf. So, whatever I need to know to stop him, tell me now."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Nine," Alas! Stopping Wong isn't the only problem. One of the Dark Ones will try to stop you from stopping him. So, you must stop it from stopping you from stopping him."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry, But how can I stop it stop me stop him?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Nine," Stop it! Behold, the Omega Device."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry, That's it?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Nine, The important thing is what's inside.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry, What does that look like?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Hutch," No one knows, man. It was invented by a blind inventor, and the one dude he described it to was deaf."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mad Fellow, So the legend goes.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Nine," When activated, the device will emit a localized blast of delta-band noise to momentarily disable the Dark One."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry," But the Dark One could look like anything or anyone, right?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Hutch, Or anywhere.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry," So, what's your plan to recognize it?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Nine, We don't have one.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry, Got it.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Hutch," And we don't dare think of one neither. 'Cause if we do, the Dark Ones might sense kind of the general vibe. Even through our mighty foil. [He pokes a hole through his hat.] Oh, man! Anyone got some tape or some gum?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Nine," As my colleague indicated, the plan cannot come from us, Fry. We were counting on you and your unreadable brain to come up with something."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry, That was a mistake.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Nine, I see that now.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Hutch," Freaky thing is, the Dark Ones' thoughts are unreadable, just like yours."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Nine," Yes, if we dared unwrap our heads, we could easily locate the one other being whose mind we can't read. The Dark One!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Hutch, But then the Dark One would read our minds and crush them like blood pumpkins.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry, Wait. I can read minds and my mind can't be read. I have a plan.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Nine," Great. Whatever it is, don't tell us."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Hutch, Wait. Fry can read minds and his mind can't be read. So he can safely scan for the Dark One...
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Nine, Shut up! Shut up!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Hutch, ...whose mind can't be read...
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mysterious Voice," Leela, time is running out. We must get to the violet star."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela," Okay, okay. Shut up, already."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Dixie," Nobody's talking, Leela."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Trixie, We're just painting each other's toenails with rat blood.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Linda, We now go live to Leela with the escape plan. Leela?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela," Thanks, Linda. Now we're in here because we tried to save endangered wildlife. So this time, endangered wildlife will save us."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Amy, The Martian muck leech.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela, [She gets light headed and has to sit down on a bed.] Little cutie almost sucked me dry.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Labarbara, Look at him go. Like a green snake through a sugarcane cake.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Hermes (on her cell phone), Keep trying.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Morbo," Our top story. The universe's most wanted eco-feminists are now behind bars, including gang leader, Turanga Leela. AKA, the Notorious B-I-Itch."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Zoidberg," We finished un-pinking the ship, Hubert. Now what?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Farnsworth," Now we get back to work. And if that means destroying an ecosystem or two, so be it."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Zoidberg," I just meant without our good friends Fry, Leela, Amy and the robut."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Farnsworth," Oh, boo-hoo."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Scruffy, Life goes on. But I believe we'll forever carry the pain on the inside.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Amy," Oh, no, a rooster! That indicates it's the following morning."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Labarbara, How's that creepy crawler doing?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela," I'm sorry, femi-sisters, but it pooped out around 3 00 a.m. Poor thing couldn't take another bite."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Amy," Well, I guess we failed. But what matters is, we tried our best and we looked good doing it."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Amy, Bender?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Bender, Who does it look like? My identical cousin Buster?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Amy, Yes.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela, You're here to break us out? But you're the one who put us in.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Bender," But I'm Bender, king of the combination shot. I put you in so that by busting you out, I could commit 15 felonies at once. Puttin' my rap sheet miles ahead of yours on the all-time chart."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela, You are one devious bastard.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Bender," That's what it says on my vanity plate. [He bends over and a license plate on his crotch plate reads ""1DVS BSTD.""]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela, What about the sentries?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela," Okay, Plan B. Everyone knows men have one fatal weakness - they can't resist hookers. Dixie, Trixie, you know what to do."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Bender," [He walks out with a swagger and speaks in an effeminate voice.] Hello, boys! [The spot lights are directed at him and he is fired at my machine guns. The firing stops.] Your eyes say no, but your machine gun fire says- [The gun fire resumes.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,,
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mr. Wong," Ladies and gentleman and whatever, welcome to my most environmentally disastrous implosion ever. A whole star system!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Zapp," Kif, old boy, mind if I sit on your shoulders for a better view?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Kif," Well, actually, sir, I was hoping..."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mr. Wong," My associate Philip Fry here will have honor to blow this ugly, dirty star into nice, clean black hole."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mr. Wong," Fry, what you doing down there?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry," [He drops a wire.] Just polishing your shoes, Mr. W."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mr. Wong," Mmm, that nice. Get between the toes there, very dirty."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Bender," Well, so much for Plan B."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela, What's Plan C?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Bender," All situations have the same Plan C. Bending, come on."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela," We're boned, Bender. It's a brick wall."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Bender," Granted, it's not on the list of approved bendables, but I'm so great!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Amy, Dogs! The boning continues.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Bender," [He pulls a telephone out of his chest.] Green Bluebird, this is Mr. Fabulous. We are go for cheesing it."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela, [She enters the bridge.] Professor! Hermes! Zoidberg! [She looks at Scruffy] Uh...
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Scruffy, Scruffy. The janitor.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela, You helped us escape? Even after we locked you in a go-go cage like common go-go dancers?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Farnsworth," I couldn't live with myself, Leela. I call myself a scientist, wear the white coat and probe a monkey every now and again, yet I put monetary gain ahead of preserving nature. Can you ever forgive me?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Scruffy, I reckon.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela," I could kiss you, Professor."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Farnsworth," Okay, but watch out for my new grill. [He smiles and shows his gold and diamond teeth.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,[Cut back to the destruction of the star system. The audience cheers as Zapp takes the stage.],
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Zapp Brannigan," Before the grand finally [Mispronunciation of finale] , as it were, it seems only fitting that I, Commodore 64 Zapp Brannigan, say a few brief pages in honor of..."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Nine (Telepathically)," Whatever your plan is, Fry, I suggest you get on with it. Get... Shoot, I got hot sauce on my Number 9 shirt."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry (Telepathically)," Okay, locate the Dark One by finding someone whose thoughts I can't read."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Zapp Brannigan, And unaccustomed...
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Zapp Brannigan (Telepathically), By God! I'm the greatest speaker of all time. They're suckling at the teats of my every syllable.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Zapp Brannigan, Allow me now...
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Kif (Telepathically), His voice is like ear sandpaper.I miss Amy.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mom (Telepathically)," [She sighs] If I had all the money in the world, I'd... Oh, wait. I do. [Evil laugh.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Calculon (Telepathically)," I'd like to thank the academy, my agent, and most of all, my operating system, Windows 7, for everything it... System error."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Snoop Dogg (Telepathically), Naked ladies. Naked ladies. Naked ladies. Naked ladies.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mr. Wong (Telepathically), I never should have taken that accent elimination class from Jackie Chan.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Zapp Brannigan," And so, as we obliterize this star, let us remember those immortal words once spoken by a great man, moi. And I quote, ""All good things must come to an end, preferably in a humongous explosion."""
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mr. Wong, Let's pop this beach ball.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,ALL, Ten! Nine! Eight!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry (Telepathically)," There's no one here whose thoughts can't be read. No one, except me! My thoughts can't be read. But, but that's crazy. If I were the Dark One, I'd know it, wouldn't I? But, here I am, right where the Dark One would be, about to blow up the star. Oh, God! Somewhere deep inside of me, it's me! I'm the Dark One!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,ALL, Two... one!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela, Put your hands in the air!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Snoop Dogg, Should we wave them like we just don't care?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela, That's optional.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mr. Wong, You girl punks gone too far this time. Your parents should be ashamed.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Amy," Yes, you should!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Kif, Amy!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mysterious Voice (Telepathically to Mr. Wong)," Destroy the star, Leo, hurry."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mr. Wong," You got it, Mr. Voice-in-my-head. [He makes a howling Kung Fu noise. Him and Leela fight over the plunger. He gets it away from her, but Amy whack him in the stomach with her putter.] I've gotta admit, Amy, you got a pretty good swing."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Amy," Really? Thanks, Dad."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela," Okay, time to defuse this star cracker once and for all. [She begins to cut the wire for the plunger.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry," Leela, wait. You're making a mistake. You have no idea what's really going on."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela, What is really going on?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry, I can't tell you.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela, Then why should I trust you? Why?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry, Because... Because...
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela, You're you. That's all I need to know.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Bender, No! Don't do it!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Scruffy, Fiddlesticks.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Amy," Leela, are you crazy? We became fugitives and jail-breakers to stop him."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Bender," And hookers, don't forget hookers."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela," Shame on all of you. After everything we've been through together, do you really think Fry would-"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry," Goodbye, Leela. I destroy myself to save you."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Nixon's Head, Where's the boom? I was expecting a boom.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry," It didn't work. I'm the Dark One, and it didn't do anything. [He throws the plunger to the floor.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mysterious Voice," [It is emitted from Leela's body.] You're not the Dark One, I am."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry, Leela?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mysterious Voice," Not Leela, you moron. Me! [It's revealed that the Desert Muck Leech is the Dark One. He screams and falls flat.] What did you do to me?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela, Ew!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Dark One," I am the Dark One. The very last Dark One. How is it possible I couldn't read your mind? Oh, I am momentarily disabled."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Randy, [He gasps.] What's happening out there?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Sal, Somethings wondersful.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela, The star and the asteroid. They were an egg and a sperm.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Preacherbot, Great modem of mercy. Cover the children's eyes.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Morbo, There are no children here.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Preacherbot, Then move your fat head. I can't see.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Nine, The Encyclopod is reborn. A new green age has begun!
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Mad Fellow, So the legend foretold.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Farnsworth, Look! Inside its pouch. Extinct Tasmanian tigers.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Amy, And dodo birds.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela, And white rhinos.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Hermes, And striped biologist-taunters.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Striped biologist-taunter," What are you gonna do, shoot us?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Encyclopod," Life! [The crowd gasps.] These once extinct plants and animals are my gift to the universe. Through untold generations, my race has treasured their DNA. Treat them wisely with the knowledge that all species are precious."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela, This is unbelievable. What's going on?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Hutch," To answer that, I must tell you a story. A story of two alien species so ancient that-"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry," Hutch, are you okay?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Hutch, My sister's femi-necklace. [He reaches for the necklace lodged in Fry's head.]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry," What? [It is pulled out of his head and he screams.]  Hey, how come I can't read your thoughts anymore?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Encyclopod," I shall avenge you, Hutch Waterfall."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Nine," After all these eons, the Dark Ones are no more. Will you preserve their DNA, O' Great Encyclopod?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Encyclopod," I suppose I should. Wait, where did it go?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Zoidberg, What?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Encyclopod," Well, at any rate, I shall preserve the DNA of Homo sapiens."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry, Huh. I thought you only saved the DNA of endangered species.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Encyclopod, Farewell. [He flies away.]
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry, I guess he didn't hear me.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Bender," Well, looks like that wraps everything up in a nice big, old, fat sack of..."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Zapp Brannigan," I hereby arrest you fugitives on 53 counts of fugivity. Kif, round them up, and spare me the weary sigh for once. [Pause.] Kif?"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Kif, [He is running into the ship with the rest of the crew.] Wait for me.
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry," Well, this is the end. There was so many things I wanted to say to you."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela, Like what?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry," Like this is not the end. But mostly just, I love you, Leela."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Leela," Maybe I waited too long to say this, but I love you, too- wormhole!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Hermes," Sweet topology of cosmology, it's huge!"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Farnsworth," If we fly into it, it could take us trillions of light years away. There's no knowing if we'll ever return."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Fry, What do we do? Should we go for it?
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,Bender," Into the breach, meatbags. Or not. Whatever. [He starts drinking the beer.]"
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,ALL," Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go."
Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 4,,
Rebirth,,
Rebirth,Bender," [voice over] On the count of three, you will awaken feeling refreshed, as if Futurama had never been cancelled by idiots, then brought back by bigger idiots. 1... 2... [snaps fingers]."
Rebirth,Bender," [voice over] This has been a test of the Emergency Hypnotoad System.  Had this been an actual hypnosis, you would go limp and watch whatever crap comes on next.  Comin' up next  Futurama! [snaps fingers]"
Rebirth,Fry," Professor, my Fry-fro's all frizzy."
Rebirth,Farnsworth, OK.
Rebirth,Fry, That's all. [slicks his hair back to normal]
Rebirth," [pause] Oh, also; I'm covered with severe burns.",
Rebirth,Farnsworth, So!?  What of it?
Rebirth,Fry," Well, why is– those things?"
Rebirth,Farnsworth, You mean you don't remember?
Rebirth,Fry," Nope, nothing. It's like when I passed out in college, except no one drew magic marker penises on my forehead."
Rebirth,Farnsworth," Well, I suppose it's for the best, considering the unbearable horrors you've endured. Let's never speak of it again."
Rebirth, [time lapse] It all began a few days ago. We were interstellar fugitives on the run from the law.,
Rebirth,Zapp, Fire all weapons and open a hailing frequency for my victory yodel.
Rebirth,Farnsworth," [voice over; flashback] And so, as you and Leela kissed goodbye in a tender display of toungesmanship, we plunged into a massive wormhole. Never to be seen again."
Rebirth,Bender," Yeah, we're back."
Rebirth,Hermes," Sweet coincidence of Port-au-Prince, we're back at Earth!"
Rebirth,Farnsworth," Of course, that was the Panama Wormhole, Earth's central channel for shipping!"
Rebirth,Zoidberg, How humorous.
Rebirth,Farnsworth," Yes! It's sort of a Comedy Central channel, and we're on it now!"
Rebirth,Amy, I get it!
Rebirth,Fry," We've lost power to the forward Game Boy, Mario not responding!"
Rebirth,Leela, Brace for emergency landing!
Rebirth,Farnsworth," Rodger that, activate Safety Spheres! [The crew activates their safety spheres, which only covers their heads. Except for Farnsworth's, which covers his entire  being.] Also mine has air conditioning."
Rebirth,Farnsworth," Yet, thanks to my trusty safety sphere, I surblibed with only tribial bray dablage."
Rebirth,Fry, And the others?
Rebirth,Farnsworth, Right here behind this horror cloth.
Rebirth,Fry, Are they dead?
Rebirth,Farnsworth," Oh, no no no, much worse."
Rebirth,Farnsworth, Move over God! Prepare for rebirth! [He pulls a lever and a ray electrocutes him] Wrong switch. [He switches on a normal light switch]
Rebirth,Farnsworth," Come on, stem cells. Work your astounding scientific nonsense!"
Rebirth,Fry, Fetal steam cells? Aren't those controversial?
Rebirth,Farnsworth," In your time yes, but nowadays, shut up! Besides, these are adult stem cells harvested from perfectly healthy adults, whom I killed for their stem cells."
Rebirth,Fry, Hermes Conrad!
Rebirth,Hermes," [He cries like a baby until Farnsworth slaps his butt] Oh, mon! I'm dripping with placenta! Good thing it's Casual Friday."
Rebirth,Fry, Amy Wong!
Rebirth,Amy," Oh, baby soft!"
Rebirth,Farnsworth, [He slaps her butt] Indeed.
Rebirth,[Dr. Zoidberg gets out],
Rebirth,<poem>Hermes, Dr. Zoidberg!
Rebirth,Zoidberg," Hermes, my friend! Let me cut off your umbilical cord. [He cuts off something of Hermes] Oops."
Rebirth,Fry, And the rest!
Rebirth,Amy," Hooray, we're back in business!"
Rebirth,Zapp," Over my dead body. [The camera zooms out, revealing his body didn't fall, thus it still being a skeleton] Uh, never mind."
Rebirth,Fry, [Looking inside] Bender! Are the steam cells working? [Bender's antennae gets out and pokes Fry's eye]
Rebirth,Bender, [He gets out and speaks with a weak voice] I'm dying. I need mouth to ass resuscitation.
Rebirth,Fry, I'm on it! [Fry leans down and blows air in Bender's ass offscreen] It's not working!
Rebirth,Bender, [laughs] I die happy knowing you fell for that.
Rebirth,Farnsworth, His power supply is shot! He is flatlining! [He goes to a shelf full of doomsday devices] Only one thing can keep him alive. [He breaks the glass and takes a doomsday device. He goes back to Bender] Possibly this thing. [He turns the device on and puts in inside Bender's chest cabinet. The liquid covering Bender melts and he gets up]
Rebirth,Bender, Woo! I've never felt so energetic! [He dances]
Rebirth,Farnsworth, That's because the doomsday device I shoved all up in you puts out 50 gigawatts. That's ten times your recommended--
Rebirth,Bender, Who are you? My warranty? [He laughs and sits down. An orange light appears in his body]
Rebirth,Farnsworth," For God's sake, Bender! Keep dancing, keep whooping it up! [Bender dances and the light turns off] You must burn off the doomsday energy as fast as it produces, or it will build to critical levels."
Rebirth,Bender, You don't mean...
Rebirth,Farnsworth," Oh, but I do. If you stop partying for a single second, you'll explode and kill everyone here in a fireball of melting gears and splattered bowels."
Rebirth,Bender," Sounds like a party, baby! [He dances]"
Rebirth,Fry," Hey! Speaking of splattered bowels, can I cook you a romantic dinner tonight, Leela?... Where's Leela? [Leela gets out of the machine] Is she okay? Why hasn't she acknowledged my dinner offer?"
Rebirth,Farnsworth, Something's wrong! She's not responding to my poking stick. [He pokes her with a stick]
Rebirth,Fry," Poke harder, damn it!"
Rebirth,Farnsworth," I'm poking as hard as I can! I'm sorry, Fry, [He takes out a device] but I'm afraid Leela is in an irreversible coma."
Rebirth,Bender," [Dancing and singing] Coma, coma, coma, coma, coma, chameleon!"
Rebirth,Fry, My soul mate is gone. Why should I go on living?
Rebirth,Bender, Because the pain slowly fades but the love is forever. [He is still dancing]
Rebirth,Fry," But, what if I forget the sweet sound of her voice or the moist touch of her eyeball on my lips?"
Rebirth,Bender, Aw! Are you still hung up on Whatshername? Move on already!
Rebirth,Fry, Maybe you're right.
Rebirth,Bender, Maybe I'm always right.
Rebirth,Fry, Build-A-Bot Workshop? It's time to start living again!
Rebirth,Fry, At least it's something to distract me from Leela. [He adds two eyes] Nah. [One of the eyes falls] Now that I like for some reason.
Rebirth,Robot Leela, [girl voice] I like jellybeans. Do you?
Rebirth,Fry," I sure do, honey."
Rebirth,Farnsworth," Come now, Fry!  You can't live out this sick fantasy!  Not without our help."
Rebirth,Hermes," These security tapes record everything at Planet Express. Including the ship, shower, and urinals."
Rebirth,<poem>Amy," And yet, it still hasn't stopped the elusive bathroom burglar."
Rebirth,Zoidberg, [with toilet paper in his mouth] Maybe he's just trying to feed his family. [ate the toilet paper]
Rebirth,Hermes," Computer, analyze tapes and extract personality profile of one Turanga Leela."
Rebirth,Computer," Analyzing...analyzing...Checking my eBay bid. [the upper left screen flashes a message saying ""Sorry, you've been outbid!""] Dammit. Analysis complete."
Rebirth,Fry," Hey, I was nuzzling that!"
Rebirth,[the robot slowly morphs into an almost exact duplicate of Leela only without her wristlojackimator],
Rebirth,<poem>Computer, Attributes transferred...Shoe size 12...etc.
Rebirth,Robot Leela," Brace for emergency landing! What? We survived the crash? Oh, Fry! [kisses him]"
Rebirth,Bender," Party people in the house say, [gasps dramatically]"
Rebirth,Robot Leela, This is wonderful! The last thing I remember I was dying in an explosion. Yet here I am in the flesh more alive than ever!
Rebirth,Fry, Alive? [clears throat]
Rebirth,Hermes," You better tell her, Fry."
Rebirth,Robot Leela, Tell me what?
Rebirth,Hermes," Anyway, my work is done. I'm gonna hit the showers."
Rebirth,Robot Leela," Nibbler, come give mama a hug! [he bites her] Ow! What the—?! Bad Nibbler! Bad Nibbler! [she shakes him off and he takes a piece of flesh from her body] What are you doing, pooperdoodle? It's me, Leela."
Rebirth,[She looks at the arm that Nibbler chewed off which reveals her wiring. She screams.],
Rebirth,[Montage," Robot Leela continues screaming and looking at her chewed off arm in front of her locker, while walking down the streets of New New York, while brushing her teeth, and while riding the tube transport system.]"
Rebirth,[End montage," Robot Leela finally stops screaming in the Professor's laboratory, which now has the real Leela, still in a coma, in a glass coffin.]"
Rebirth,<poem>Robot Leela," Am I really just a robot? I mean, I have Leela's memories!  Her opinion of gazelles! (Majestic.)  Her emotions! (Confused and hurt.)"
Rebirth,Fry," I swear.  I didn't know this would happen.  The only thing I truly know is I love you. [holds her hand, but then looks at the real Leela] I mean her—Wait, help me out here."
Rebirth,Bender, Do the Bender! Do the Bender!
Rebirth,Randy, No thank you.
Rebirth,Bender," [threateningly] I said, ""Do it!"""
Rebirth,[Cut to, Fry and Robot Leela are sitting at a table in the club. Robot Leela now has white bandages on to hide where the wirings are.]
Rebirth,<poem>Robot Leela," The truth is, Fry, I still have feelings for you.  But are they really my feelings? Am I just an automaton or can a machine of sufficient complexity legitimately achieve consciousness?"
Rebirth,Fry, I agree.
Rebirth,Robot Leela," I need some time to figure this out.  Until then, [puts her hand out in friendship] friends?"
Rebirth,Fry, [shaking her hand] Okay.
Rebirth,Bender," Listen up, disco dummies, you just flunked outta Bender's College for Party Knowledge!"
Rebirth,Bender, Do the back dance! Do the back dance! Ooh....
Rebirth,Farnsworth (v.o.)," Good news, everyone..."
Rebirth,[Scene, Farnsworth's laboratory]
Rebirth,<poem>Farnsworth (cont'd)," I'm going to make one final attempt to awaken Leela. [everyone cheers] After all, there's always hope."
Rebirth,Fry, Really?
Rebirth,Farnsworth," [activating some sort of device] No, don't get your hopes up. Frankly, she's just a brainless mound of scabs and pus."
Rebirth,Fry, [disgusted] Oh! I didn't need to hear that.
Rebirth,Farnsworth," No, and you don't need to see this."
Rebirth,Machine, Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
Rebirth,Machine, Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!!!! WAKE UP!!!!!!!!!!!
Rebirth,Farnsworth," Well, that's it. I'm afraid traditional medicine has failed."
Rebirth,Fry," No! [runs over to Leela's body with a blernsball bat] I refuse to give up! Wake up, Leela! [hits her with the bat on each word] I! Love! You!"
Rebirth,Robot Leela," Fry, stop. She's gone."
Rebirth,Farnsworth," Dr. Zoidberg, can you note the time and declare the patient legally dead?"
Rebirth,Zoidberg, Can I? That's my specialty.
Rebirth,Hermes," As you all know, Leela's living will states that in the event of coma, her body is to be fed to the wild Cyclophage, a highly endangered creature that eats only cyclopses."
Rebirth,Bender," [while still partying, holding Leela's wallet and taking her donor card out] Yep, that's what her donor card says. [puts the card back and, as is his nature, steals all the money from the wallet]"
Rebirth,Fry," [kisses Leela] Goodbye, my love. [he sobs heavily]"
Rebirth,Farnsworth, The beast aproacheth.
Rebirth,Bender, To the beat y'all! To the beat y'all! I'm dancin' a jig wid ma feets y'all!
Rebirth,Amy (whispering)," Bender, cut it out! People are trying to have emotions!"
Rebirth,Bender (angry), You think I wanna party? [stops partying] I'm sick of partying! [resumes] Woohoo! More partying! [beatboxes]
Rebirth,Leela," Bender, shut the hell up!"
Rebirth,Farnsworth," Bender, stop shutting the hell up!"
Rebirth,Bender," Oh, right. [resumes partying but in a sarcastic way] Leela's back. As if I care. Woo."
Rebirth,Leela, Thanks. It's so nice to wake up and see— [gasps]
Rebirth,Fry, Leela?!
Rebirth,Robot Leela, Leela?
Rebirth,Leela, [getting out of her coffin] Leela?
Rebirth,Hermes, Leela.
Rebirth,Leela, [walking towards her duplicate] How is this possible? And can you believe she wore a tank top to my funeral?
Rebirth,Robot Leela, Shut up! [grabbing Leela's arm] We gotta get outta here!
Rebirth,Leela," [grabbing her twin's tank top straps] No, you ""Shut up! We gotta get outta here!"""
Rebirth,[Everyone runs away as the Cyclophage chases them down and stomps on the coffin that previously held the coma-induced Leela.],
Rebirth,[Everyone is still running away from the Cyclophage except for Bender who cartwheels away],
Rebirth,<poem>Bender," Ooh, yeah, baby, come on!"
Rebirth,Bender, All aboard the party ship!
Rebirth,[The ship attempts to get off the ground but it rocks back and forth],
Rebirth,[Cut to, Both Leelas are fighting over the steering wheel]
Rebirth,<poem>Leela, There's no room for two captains' butts in this chair!
Rebirth,Robot Leela, There would be if you'd taken a spin class instead of lounging around in a coma!
Rebirth,Leela (v.o.), This is crazy.
Rebirth,Leela, It's like I'm looking at an exact robot duplicate of myself.
Rebirth,Farnsworth, That is what you're looking at.
Rebirth,Leela," Oh.  How could you do this, Fry?"
Rebirth,Fry," Uh, coma. Sad."
Rebirth,Robot Leela, I have to go!  This is just too freaky! [she exits the room out the door]
Rebirth,Fry," Don't get upset, Leela.  She's nothing like you."
Rebirth,Leela, I have to go!  This is just too freaky! [she exits the room out the door]
Rebirth,Fry," I need cheering up, Bender.  I dunno.  You wanna go out and party tonight?"
Rebirth,Bender," [even though he's still partying] I hate partying!  If only I didn't have so much crunk in my badunkadunk!  Ooh, yeah! Come on, babe!"
Rebirth,Fry (sighing)," Why does everything I date run away?  I love Leela, always and forever.  And if I loved Robot Leela, too..."
Rebirth,Fry (cont'd)," ...well, that's only 'cause she had so much of real Leela in her.  I thought she loved me, too, but, obviously, I was wrong as usual."
Rebirth,Leela, Wrong again.  You were right.
Rebirth,Fry, Leela?  Leela Leela?
Rebirth,Leela," Leela Leela.  I've been thinking, Fry, if I lost you, I don't think I could stand it, either.  I'd probably build a copy of you, too. [kisses him] As long as Robo-Leela's not a jealous type like me, thing will wor—"
Rebirth,Robot Leela," I'll kill you, you slut-clops!  Hee-ya! [karate kicks her duplicate in the face] He's mine!"
Rebirth,Leela," Oh, back off, missy!"
Rebirth,Amy," Somebody do something! [gives Fry a gun] Here, take this."
Rebirth,Fry, A gun?!  D-Do I really need to—?
Rebirth,Leela, Shoot her!  She's the robot!
Rebirth,Robot Leela," No, shoot her!  She's the human!"
Rebirth,Fry, But-But how do I know who's the human and who's the robot?
Rebirth,Leela, We just told you!
Rebirth,Robot Leela," Yeah, you idiot!"
Rebirth,Fry," Okay. Fine. If you're gonna be like that, I'm not shooting anyone. [accidentally drops the gun which shoots at his chest area] Whoa! Right between the lungs. Man, that was close. [screams]"
Rebirth,Fry (gasps)," I'm a robot, too!"
Rebirth,Zoidberg, [picking up an x-ray of Robot Fry] Aha!  That explains this growth on your drive shaft.
Rebirth,Robot Fry, But how is this possible?
Rebirth,Farnsworth," Who knows?  Oh, I do.  Allow me to explain what really happened the day the ship crashed."
Rebirth,Fry," I'll protect you, Leela!  My love is stronger than the vast majority of explosions!"
Rebirth,Farnsworth (v.o.)," Fry did in fact save Leela, though at a terrible cost to himself.  I tossed him into the stem cells but he just bubbled away like phlegm on a hot sidewalk."
Rebirth,"[As the remains of Fry bubble away, the camera pans up to reveal Leela running out crying all the way to Build-a-Bot Workshop.]",
Rebirth,<poem>Farnsworth (v.o.)," Leela was so upset, she went all Blade Runner and built a duplicate..."
Rebirth,Farnsworth (v.o), ...then uploaded his personality from the urinal surveillance tapes.
Rebirth,Fry, [from the tape of him at the urinal] I sure love Leela.
Rebirth,Farnsworth (v.o.)," Alas, in recreating Fry's adorable jelly belly, she had overstuffed him with copper wadding."
Rebirth,Farnsworth (v.o.), The inevitable static discharged electrocuted Leela and destroyed both of their short-term memories.
Rebirth,Robot Fry, So that's why I'm so amazed by these things I already knew.
Rebirth,Farnsworth (v.o.), What could I do?  I hung up Leela with the other bone bags and went to procure the final ingredient for my stem cell brew.
Rebirth,Robot Fry," Professor, my Fry-fro's all frizzy."
Rebirth,Leela," My god, I can't believe I'll never see that particular Fry again."
Rebirth,Fry," Hey, where's my shoes?"
Rebirth,Robot Fry, Fry!
Rebirth,Fry," [putting on his clothes] Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was already here. Wait, what's with all the Leelas?"
Rebirth,Robot Fry," Trust me, don't ask."
Rebirth,Fry," Okay, dork. Listen, I'm gonna hit the urinal, maybe talk about myself a little bit, then—"
Rebirth,Robot Leela, Hang on!  It's time to sort things out.  The truth is I love Fry. [points to Robot Fry] That Fry.
Rebirth,Robot Fry, And I love Leela.  Any Leela.
Rebirth,Robot Leela, We're robots and we're in love. Let's ditch these meat jackets.
Rebirth,Robot Fry," Whoa, cool!"
Rebirth,Robot Fry," [in a voice like a terminator] Hasta la vista, wiener!"
Rebirth,Robot Leela, [also in a voice like a terminator] We'll be back...for our stuff.
Rebirth,Amy, Why did their voices change?
Rebirth,Farnsworth, That's the one thing we'll never truly understand.
Rebirth,Fry," Uh, this is a bit awkward.  Or is it?"
Rebirth,Leela, I'm not sure. I lost track around the second robot.
Rebirth,Fry," Well, you know how I feel.  I waited for you for a thousand years.  I can wait a little longer."
Rebirth,Bender, Pffft!  What a load of mush!  I've had it!
Rebirth,Amy (gasps), He's gonna blow!
Rebirth,Farnsworth," Party, Bender!  Party for your life!"
Rebirth,Bender," No chance, hot pants!  I'd rather die and kill all of you than party for one more millisecond!"
Rebirth,Leela, The cyclops eater!
Rebirth,Bender," Hold on, mac!  It ain't like that!"
Rebirth,Bender," Geez, what's it take to kill me?"
Rebirth,Farnsworth," Bender, you blew out your excess capacity!  You're cured!"
Rebirth,Bender," [relieved] Oh, sweet mercy.  My hellish nightmare is over. I never have to party again."
Rebirth,Fry," Well, that's that, then.  We're back, everyone!"
Rebirth,Bender, Party!!
Rebirth,Zapp, Wheeee!
Rebirth,,
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, This is awesome! I've been waiting a thousand years to see a Beastie Boys show.
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, Can I get anybody a beer?
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, Sure!
Hell Is Other Robots,Announcer," [on loudspeaker] Ladies and gentlemen, here to lay down some old, old, incredibly old school beats  The Beastie Boys!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Beastie Boys," [singing] Well now don't you tell to smile,"
Hell Is Other Robots,"You stick around,,",
Hell Is Other Robots,I'll make it worth your while,
Hell Is Other Robots,"Got numbers beyond what you can dial,",
Hell Is Other Robots,"Maybe it's because I'm so versatile,",
Hell Is Other Robots,"Style profile I said,",
Hell Is Other Robots,It always brings me back when I hear Wu Child...,
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela, Impressive. They're busting mad rhymes with an 80% success rate.
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, I believe that qualifies as ill. At least from a technical standpoint.
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, Will you guys shut up! I'm trying to look cool.
Hell Is Other Robots,Beastie Boys, [singing] ...known for the Flintstone Flop
Hell Is Other Robots,"Tammy D gettin' biz on the crop,",
Hell Is Other Robots,Beastie Boys know to let the beat...,
Hell Is Other Robots,Mike, Drop! [His dancer drops him and his head flies off the stage. The crowd pass him over them.] Ow! How's it going? [They pass him again.] Enjoying the show? Ow! [They pass him again and he disappears into the crowd.] [shouting] Don't forget to pick up a T-shirt!
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry," Wow! An old-fashioned mosh pit! Come on, guys. Tonight we're gonna party like its 1999 ... again."
Hell Is Other Robots,Beastie Boys, [singing] Well it's 50 cups of coffee and you know it's on
Hell Is Other Robots,I move the crowd to the break of break of dawn...,
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela," Ow! Hey, watch it!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry," Man, these guys rock harder than ever!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Mike," [singing] Oh, my..."
Hell Is Other Robots,MCA, [singing] It's a mirage...
Hell Is Other Robots,Ad-Rock, [singing] Tellin' you all it's a...
Hell Is Other Robots,Beastie Boys, [singing] Sabotage!
Hell Is Other Robots,Ad-Rock," [singing] Sabotage, yeah!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Mike," Peace, we out!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Fender," Hey, Bender!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," Hey, Fender! Man, I haven't seen you since high school. You still workin' at Jack In The Box?"
Hell Is Other Robots,Fender," Not anymore, baby. I'm with the band!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Mike," Aw! Oh, yeah!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Fender," Hey, fellas, hey. I want you to meet my friends, Bender, Fry and Leela."
Hell Is Other Robots,Ad-Rock," Y'know, we're really not that interested in meeting them."
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry," Wow! I love you guys! Back in the 20th century, I had all five of your albums."
Hell Is Other Robots,Ad-Rock, That was a thousand years ago. Now we got seven.
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, Cool! Can I borrow the new ones? And a couple of blank tapes?
Hell Is Other Robots,Fender," [whispering] Hey, Bender, why don't we ditch these organ sacks and hit the real party?"
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, Count me in! I'm gonna drink till I reboot!
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker."
Hell Is Other Robots,Fender," Don't be a drag, man. We're jacking on! [He plugs himself into the machine and shocks himself.] Aw, yeah! [He takes the plug out and offers it to Bender.] Wanna jolt?"
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," Uh, hey, I'm no square but isn't that counter-indicated by my operations manual?"
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot, Counter indicated!
Hell Is Other Robots,Fender," Come on, Bender, grab a jack. I told these guys you were cool."
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," Well, if jacking on'll make strangers think I'm cool, I'll do it!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Fender," Easy, baby. You don't wanna get hooked on this stuff."
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," Eh, no need to worry. I don't have an addictive personality."
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry," Hey, uh, Bender? What are we doing in this bad neighbourhood?"
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," Shut up, square! [Bender walks off the street down into a place called Sparky's Den. His shades fall off. His eyes are blue and electrified.] I'll just be a minute!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Preacherbot," Wretched sinner unit! The path to robot heaven lies here ... [He takes out a 3.5"" disk.] ... in The Good Book 3.0."
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, Hey! Do I preach to you when you're lying stoned in the gutter? No! So beat it!
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, Who was that guy?
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, Your mama! Now shut up and drag me to work!
Hell Is Other Robots,Hermes, Our electric bill's climbing faster than a green snake up a sugar cane. Obviously someone round been wastin' a whole heap a juice! Probably you!
Hell Is Other Robots,Zoidberg, Me?
Hell Is Other Robots,Amy," Good morning, Bender."
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, None of your business! Get off my back!
Hell Is Other Robots,Amy, What's his problem?
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela, If I didn't know better I'd almost think he was abusing electricity.
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, Bender? No way! [The lights dim.] I definitely would've noticed something.
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela," Bender, why are you spending so much time in the bathroom? Are you jacking on in there?"
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, [from inside] No! Don't come in!
Hell Is Other Robots,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Today you'll be delivering a crate of subpoenas to Sicily 8, the Mob Planet!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," Alright, let's get to work! I'll be out in a second."
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, I know Big Vinnie said he was giving me the kiss of death but I still think he was gay.
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela, Did he use his tongue?
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry," A little. [Leela cringes. Bender sits in the corner chewing his fingers.] You OK, Bender?"
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, None of your business! Get off my back!
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela, Uh-oh. There seems to be some sort of electrical disturbance in the Coalsack Nebula.
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, A what kind of disturbance?
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela," Electrical. Anyway, it's going to take some careful piloting to avoid it."
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela, We're out of control. We're heading straight into the electric field!
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, What's happening? I-I feel weird!
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," Come on, universe, you big, mostly empty wuss! Gimmie all the juice you got! [Lightning strikes Bender's antenna and he jitters. Another bolt strikes him and a third. His legs melt.] Oh, mama!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, What?
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela," Bender, we didn't mind your drinking, or your kleptomania, or your pornography ring."
Hell Is Other Robots,Zoidberg," In fact, that's why we loved you."
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela, But this electricity abuse crossed the line. You almost killed us.
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, And you made me feel like a jerk for trusting you. Just like when my friend Richie swore he wasn't taking drugs and then he sold me my mom's VCR and then later I found out he was taking drugs. You make me ashamed to be your friend.
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, You're right. I'm a lost cause.
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, Maybe there's another way.
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," Oh, yeah, that's the good stuff. [The sign short circuits. Bender unplugs himself and cries.] [crying] What am I doing? What have I become? Huh?"
Hell Is Other Robots,Preacherbot," I see a lot of fancy robots here today, made of real shiny metal. But that don't impress the Robot Devil, no, sir!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Vergerbot," No, sir!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Preacherbot," 'Cause if you're a sinner, he's gonna plug his infernal modem in the wall, belchin' smoke and flame. And he's gonna download you straight to Robot Hell!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Vergerbot, Straight to hell!
Hell Is Other Robots,Preacherbot, So I ask you  Who will stand up and be saved? Who? Who?
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, [weakly] Me.
Hell Is Other Robots,Hermes," And as a further cost-cutting measure, I have eliminated the salt-water cooler."
Hell Is Other Robots,Zoidberg, This is a witch hunt!
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," [singing] Oh, what a beautiful morning,"
Hell Is Other Robots,Oh what a beautiful day!,
Hell Is Other Robots,"(talking) Greetings, friends. Don't we all look nice today?",
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, Great! He's whacked out on electricity again.
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," No, I'm whacked out on life. My friends, I found religion."
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, Religion? Is this another scam to get free yarmulkes?
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela," Give him a break, Fry. If this helps Bender clean up his act then I think we should be supportive."
Hell Is Other Robots,Farnsworth, [simultaneous] Yes.
Hell Is Other Robots,Amy," [simultaneous] Oh, yeah."
Hell Is Other Robots,Hermes," [simultaneous] Oh, yes!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Zoidberg," [simultaneous] Oh, yeah."
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," Wonderful. Then you'll all come to my exceedingly long, un-air-conditioned baptism ceremony!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Preacherbot," We are gathered here today to deliver brother Bender from the cold, steel grip of the Robot Devil unto the cold, steel bosom of our congregation."
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot #2," Tell it, Preacher!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot #3, That equals true.
Hell Is Other Robots,Preacherbot," Brother Bender, do you accept the principles of Robotology on pain of eternal damnation in Robot Hell?"
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," Yes, I do."
Hell Is Other Robots,Preacherbot, Then I will now baptise you. [A keyboard appear from his waist.] Press any key to continue.
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," Uh, while you're at it, could you touch up this seam?"
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela, This is unbelievable. The old Bender never would have taken us out to dinner.
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, The old Bender's gone. He won't trouble you anymore.
Hell Is Other Robots,Waiter, Would monsieur care to see the wine list?
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," No poison for us, thanks. I'll stick with good old mineral oil. [He drinks the oil.] Ah! Functional!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Hermes," Mon, I'm hungrier than a green snake in a sugar cane field!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, Friends! Friends! Surely you're not going to eat before we say Robot Grace? [The staff grumble. Bender closes his eyes.] In the name of all that is good and logical we give thanks for the chemical energy we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerematic  1000101010101...
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, ...0010110012. Amen.
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, Does that mean we can eat now?
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," Yes. [The crew tuck in.] But first, since I love you all so much, I'd like to give everyone hugs. Come here, Fry!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry," Oh, uh, but I don't want to."
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," Mmm! Mmm! Fry, you're my friend! [Fry, unsure, pats Bender on the back. Bender stands up again.] Come on, everyone line up for a hug. Let's tear down some emotional walls."
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela, What are you doing to my ship?
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, Sanctifying it! [Leela sighs. Bender has stuck on a robot version of the Ichthus.] There! That ought to convert a few tailgaters.
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, Bender's stupid religion is driving me nuts.
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela, Amen.
Hell Is Other Robots,Farnsworth, If only he had joined a mainstream religion like Oprah-ism or Voodoo.
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, We've got to get the old Bender back.
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela," And I think I know a way to do it. We have to reacquaint him with a little thing called ""sleaze""."
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, I can't believe somebody hired an interstellar spaceship to deliver a package to Atlantic City. What are we delivering anyway?
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry," Uh, this."
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, Where are we delivering it to?
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela," Uh, here."
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, Another job well done. Now back to the office for an enjoyable evening of fasting and repentance.
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry," Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Bender. So long as we're here why don't we take in some exotic dancing?"
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela," Hey, great idea!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, But ... those girls don't wear cases. You can see their bare circuits.
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry," Come on, it'll be fun! Maybe we could even drink a little fortified wine."
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, What? Drinking wine is a sin. Even if it is deliciously fortified.
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela," Hey, Bender, look at that woman's purse. It's hanging by a spaghetti strand."
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, Thou shalt not snatch.
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, And there's Hookerbot 5000. She's got a heart of solid gold!
Hell Is Other Robots,Hookerbot," Hey, sailing unit!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, Stop tempting me! For once in my life I have inner peace.
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry," Pfft! That's for losers. C'mon, sin your heart out."
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela, Go nuts.
Hell Is Other Robots,Hookerbot, Live a little.
Hell Is Other Robots,Woman, Could you hold my purse for a minute?
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry," Go for it, Bender. You know you wanna!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, Well...
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, I'm the greatest. [He opens the woman's purse and throws money into the air.] Woo-hoo!
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, Look's like we got the old Bender back!
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," You know it, pork pie! Except for one thing."
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," Y'know, as a major Hollywood director, I'll be holding auditions tonight for my next movie. And even though you're all young and naive, I think you might just have what it takes. [The Fembots laugh. There is a knock at the door.] Hey! I'm trying to score here! Can't you read the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign? [He wraps a towel around his waist and opens the door. A red glows comes from the corridor. Bender gasps.] No! No!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil," Greetings, Bender! Welcome to Robot Hell."
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela, What in hell happened to Bender?
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry," Well he didn't check out. The ashtray's still here. [Nibbler yelps.] Look, Nibbler's caught the scent of vodka and motor oil! Go, boy. Follow that stench."
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," I'm hallucinating this, right?"
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil," No, Bender. Robot Hell is quite real. Here's our brochure."
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, But I don't belong here. I don't like things that are scary and painful.
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil," Sorry, Bender, you agreed to this when you joined our religion. If you sin you go to Robot Hell, for all eternity."
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," Aw, hell-- I mean ""heck""!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil," It's alright, you can say that here."
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, Wait! I remember this place. They shut it down after all those people caught salmonella from the flume ride.
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela, Hmm. Look! It's the symbol of Bender's old religion.
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry," Unbelievable. It's an actual, factual Robot Hell."
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela, Who would've thought hell would really exist? And that it would be in New Jersey!
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, Actually--
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil," We know all your sins, Bender. And for each one we've prepared an agonising and ironic punishment. Gentlemen?"
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," Aw, crap, singing. Mind if I smoke?"
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil," [singing] Cigars are evil,"
Hell Is Other Robots,"You won't miss 'em,",
Hell Is Other Robots,"We'll find ways to simulate that smell,",
Hell Is Other Robots,"What a sorry fella,",
Hell Is Other Robots,"Rolled up and smoked like a panatela,",
Hell Is Other Robots,Here on level one of Robot Hell!,
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil," [singing] Gambling's wrong and so is cheating,"
Hell Is Other Robots,"So is forging phoney IOU's,",
Hell Is Other Robots,"Let's let Lady Luck decide,",
Hell Is Other Robots,"What type of torture's justified,",
Hell Is Other Robots,I'm pit boss here on level two!,
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil, [talking] Ooh! Deep-fried robot!
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, [singing] Just tell me why.
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil, [singing] Please read this 55-page warrant.
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, [singing] There must be robots worse than I.
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil," [singing] We've checked around, there really aren't."
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," [singing] Then please let me explain,"
Hell Is Other Robots,My crimes were merely boy-ish pranks.,
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil," [singing] You stole from boy scouts, nuns and banks!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," [singing] Ah, don't blame me,"
Hell Is Other Robots,Blame my upbringing!,
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil, [singing] Please stop sinning while I'm singing!
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil," [singing] Selling bootleg tapes is wrong,"
Hell Is Other Robots,Musicians need that income to survive.,
Hell Is Other Robots,Beastie Boys," [singing] Hey, Bender, gonna make some noise,"
Hell Is Other Robots,With your hard drive scratched by the Beastie Boys!,
Hell Is Other Robots,"That's whatcha, whatcha, whatcha get on level five!",
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, [singing] I don't feel well.
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela, [singing] It's up to us to rescue him.
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, [singing] Maybe he likes it here in Hell.
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela, [singing] It's us who tempted him to sin.
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, [singing] Maybe he's back at the motel.
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela," [singing] Come on, Fry, don't be scared,"
Hell Is Other Robots,"I'm sure at least one of us will be spared,",
Hell Is Other Robots,"So just sit back, enjoy the ride.",
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, [singing] My ass has blisters from the slide.
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil," [singing] Fencing diamonds,"
Hell Is Other Robots,"Fixing cockfights,",
Hell Is Other Robots,"Publishing indecent magazines,",
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil," You'll pay for every crime,"
Hell Is Other Robots,"Knee-deep in electric slime,",
Hell Is Other Robots,"You'll suffer till the end of time,",
Hell Is Other Robots,"Enduring torture's, most of which rhyme,",
Hell Is Other Robots,Trapped forever here in Robot Hell!,
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil," [talking] Of course, that's just for starters."
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry," Bender, are you alright?"
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," No! Oh, they're tormenting me with up-tempo singing and dancing."
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela," Alright, Beelzebot, what'll it take to get our friend back?"
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil," Sorry, but I hold all the cards here. There's nothing I can do. Now, if you'll just sign this fiddle contest waiver."
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela, Wait. What fiddle contest?
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil," The Fairness In Hell Act of 2275 requires me to inform you that if you can best me in a fiddle contest, you win back Bender's soul. As well as a solid gold fiddle."
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, Wouldn't a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds of pounds and sound crummy?
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil, Well it's mostly for show.
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela, [whispering] Do you know how to play the fiddle?
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, [whispering] No. Do you?
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela," [whispering] No, but I used to play the drums. They're sorta similar. [talking] What happens if we lose?"
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil," You'll only win a smaller, silver fiddle. Also I guess I'll kill one of you, uh, him."
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela, We'll do it.
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil," Very well, then. Beat this."
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," Well, we're boned."
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil, Your turn. [He hands the violin to Leela. She plays awfully. Fry and Bender cringe.] Ha!
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela, Time for the drum solo!
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, Run!
Hell Is Other Robots,Robot Devil, Stop them! They cheated!
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela," Hurry, Bender!"
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, I could if you'd drop the stupid gold violin!
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela," Oh, sorry."
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender," Don't worry, guys, I'll never be too good or too evil again. From now on, I'll just be me."
Hell Is Other Robots,Leela," Uh, do you think you could be just little less evil than that."
Hell Is Other Robots,Bender, I don't know. Do you think you could survive a 700ft fall?
Hell Is Other Robots,Fry, Good old Bender!
Hell Is Other Robots,Beastie Boys," Yeah, yeah! This one goes out to my man, Bender,"
Hell Is Other Robots,"Sending this one out, special dedication,",
Hell Is Other Robots,"To all my peoples in the robot homeworld,",
Hell Is Other Robots,"Yeah, yeah! Big up with the Professor,",
Hell Is Other Robots,"My man, Dr. Zoidberg,",

In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Emperor Chop Chop," No one can save you now, Leela."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela Actress," Well, what about Zapp Brannigan?"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Emperor Chop Chop," Well, obviously, Zapp Brannigan can save you, but— [the door opens and Zapp, portraying himself, walks in] Zapp Brannigan!"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," So, Emperor Chop Chop, once again we meet at last! Drop that space gun or I'll shoot!  Like so! [shoots the villain and unties the actress portraying Leela]"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela Actress," Oh, Zapp!  Tie me back up and ravish me!"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," I'd like to, Leela.  So I will."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," Ooh, yeah, shake it, baby. Shake it like— [Kif taps him and he wakes up]  I surrender and volunteer for treason!"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Kif," [saluting] Emergency summons from the President, captain."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," Oh, it's you.  Just let me freshen up. [gets out of bed] Computer, captain's musk."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, The long dramatic corridor.  That's never a good sign.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Scanner," Glove recognized. Proceed, Mrs. Eisenhower."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,[The doors open to reveal President Richard Nixon's Head with a secret service agent in a meeting room with a huge monitor.  Zapp and Kif enter saluting.],
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,<poem>Zapp," Mr. President, what the hell?"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Nixon," At ease, Brannigan."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Nixon," What you're about to see is highly classified. Reptillicus, hit the thingy."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Nixon," [with a laser pointer in his mechanical hand] At 0000 hours, Planet XXX was attacked by a mysterious death sphere. [points to the death sphere]"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, [pointing to the death sphere with another laser pointer] Magnify that death sphere. [the image is magnified] Why's it still blurry?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Kif, That's all the resolution we have. Making it bigger doesn't make it clearer.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, It does on CSI  Miami.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Nixon," They fought back with advance military hardware, but it was like shooting BB's at Bebe Rebozo."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, That poor brave hardware.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Nixon, The sphere then fired some kind of hellish blackout ray.  Erased that planet like eighteen minutes of incriminating tape.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," Oh, I just wish I understood why.  Why I should care."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Nixon, Because the death sphere is now on course for Earth! Rowrowooooooo!!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," My god, we're defenseless. Like fish in a barrel."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Nixon, Options?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, My instinct is to hide in this barrel. [camera cuts to reveal Zapp doing so] Like the wily fish.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Nixon, [sighs] Then we're down to our last hope.  A radical new weapon built by a visionary scientist I once dismissed as crazy.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth," Let's see how crazy I am now, Nixon! [camera zooms out to reveal he is actually speaking to Nixon and the entire Planet Express crew] The correct answer is  very."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Nixon," Alright, Professor. Sock it to me!"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth," Top secret news, everyone! I've developed a tiny one-man stealth fighter that's virtually undetectable."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, [coming out of a barrel] How undetectable?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth, It's right in front of you.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, [walking toward a semmingly empty space] I find that—OW! [bumps into something]—to believe.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Bender, But how exactly is this Happy Meal toy gonna destroy a giant death sphere?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth, From within.  This ship should be able to sneak undetected through the sphere's one vulnerable opening.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Hermes, What vulnerable opening?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth, All death spheres have one vulnerable opening.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zoidberg," Well, sure, but who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a ""death sphere""?"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,NIxon, I say Brannigan.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, [saluting] I say no.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, I say me.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Nixon, I say Leela.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, I say yes.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Fry, I say no.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," I say Leela, too."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, I say yes again.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, I say I shall join her.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, But it's only a one-man craft...I say.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, There'll only be one man.  Me.  How would you feel if I rode rear as your personal tail gunner?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, Creeped out.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, Then it's decided.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, [stepping into the ship] Are you sure I have to sit in your lap?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, It'll help us achieve maximum thrust.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Fry, [giving Leela a bag of trail mix] I made you some trail mix for the flight. [Leela takes it as Fry picks up a huge painting of himself in a robe smoking a pipe] Also this picture to remember me by.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, You hold on to it. [kisses him] I'll be back soon.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth, [scoffs] Activate stealth shielding.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, Liftoff!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, I'll rodger that.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Fry, Did anyone else feel aroused and jealous and worried?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Bender, I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, Death sphere in range.  Engaging holographic targeting. [presses a button and a hologram of the sphere comes up]  Activating the Force.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,The Force," [a la Obi-Wan Kenobi] Feel the entrance, Leela. Destination on your left in... [monotone] zero point three [regular voice] miles."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, Zapp to Leela  look at all that surveillance equipment.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, [whispering] We better whisper.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, Switching to pillow talk mode.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, Look.  What are those huge letters?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," ""V-GINY?"" Doesn't ring a bell."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth (v.o.), Hmmm....
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth," I don't like the looks of this ""V-GINY.""  Does anyone recognize those call letters?"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Hermes, Nope.  It's not in the Janeway's Guide either.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth, Deciphering that ID code is critical.  I'll be in the Chamber of Understanding.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, This is it! The moment we should've trained for!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, Holy cr—
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, Incoming yucky!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, Firing pocket rocket!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," Don't panic, Leela! Go go go go go!"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, I hope this is the control stick!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, Captain's Log  We've lost control.  Addendum  Whoooaa-oooooaa-ooaaaah!!!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Transition Announcer," And now, back to The Transcredible Exploits of Zapp Brannigan!"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," [once again from the Bartley's logo] Chapter Two  ""The Heat Thickens""."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," Leela, wake up! I can't face this mysterious planet alone without you or someone like you."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela," Zapp?  Zapp, wake up!"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, Leela? Where are we.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela," We crashed on an uncharted planet.  When I woke up, I was pinned under this tree. Can you help me?"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," [walking toward the tree] If anyone can move it, I can. [attempts to lift the tree but fails] No one can move it. Are you hurt?"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, No. But I'm so thirsty.  This spacesuit is making me sweat like a sow.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," Me, too. We better strip them off and continue surviving au naturel."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela," Uh, I suppose so."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, Here.  We can cover ourselves with these sticky sap-covered leaves.  I'll try to avert my eyes from your nudery.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela," You will? [turns to reveal she's already covered] Eh, what's the point? You'll have to look sooner or later."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," Well, I promise not to abuse the privilege. For now, I better scout around for food and water and help."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, What a thoughtful and considerate thing to say.  What the hell's wrong with you?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," I'm not quite sure. Perhaps it's the fresh air or a severe head injury.  In any case, I'm off."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela," [as Zapp walks away] If you see any steaks, that'd be good!"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Fry, Why isn't Leela back yet? [to Bender] Do you think she's okay?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Bender, How should I know?  And how come you never ask if I'm okay?  I'm feelin' a little neglected here!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Fry," Oh, sorry. Are you okay, Bender?"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Bender, Shut up!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Hermes," What difference does it make?  When that death sphere gets to Earth, we'll all be blown to Manwich meat!"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Amy," Well, I guess it's time to indulge in some end-of-the-world debauchery.  Who's up for an orgy?"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zoidberg, Maybe a Parcheesi tournament.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth, Belay that Parcheesi tournament! I've identified the death sphere! We may yet have a faint hope of survival!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zoidberg," Still, a Parcheesi tournament."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth, This is a top secret military satellite launched by the Air Force in 1998.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth (cont'd), And this is a top secret FCC satellite launched that same year to censor indecent TV programs.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Bender, Like The Pimpsons? And Assarama?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth," Precisely.  However, the satellites collided shortly after launch and were never heard from again."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zoidberg, I found the board!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth," Now, I've simulated that collision using Shrapnovision(?)."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Fry," [taking a piece of one of the satellites out of his hair] Granted, all that makes perfect sense, but why is this death sphere destroying planets?"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth," That makes the most sense of all. [Farnsworth puts up a projection of planets destroyed by the death sphere.] Look at the planets it's destroyed so far.  First came XXX, the nude beach planet.  Then Poopiter.  [A planet labelled ""#[email protected]€$!#%&"" comes on screen.] And finally that world that can't be mentioned in polite company."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Fry, You mean...
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Amy, Aw!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth, How dare you!?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Amy, Shame on—
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Hermes," So the death sphere is ""censoring"" indecent planets?"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth, Indeed.  And we're next if we can't keep it in our collective pants!  Our sole hope is to persuade the people of Earth to abandon their smutty ways.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Amy, So the orgy's off?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, So thirsty.  Why couldn't a water fountain have fallen on me?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, I couldn't find any water.  But the moisture in these fruit and nut berries should sustain you.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, Thank you.  [takes them and eats them]
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," I climbed perilously high into the trees to pick them, yet I saw no sign of intelligent life."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, Bummer.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," Moreover, the crash totally destroyed our ship."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, So we're stuck here until someone finds us?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," Alas, that may never happen.  Stealth technology makes the ship impossible to locate yet easy to stub your crotch on."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela," Well, there's worse places to be marooned.  Plenty of food, mild climate."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, It's a veritable Garden of Eden.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, It is?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Snake, Hello.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela," Did that snake say, ""Hello""?"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," No, we're both delirious from dehydration."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Snake, Just like Adam and Eve.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth (v.o.), We can still save Earth.  People are sure to clean up their act when presented with cold hard facts by rational folks like us.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth, The end is near! Repent thy sins!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Sal, [giving money to Petunia] I'll thinks it overs while I engages this five dollar hooker.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Fry, [taking the bullhorn from Farnsworth] Don't do it! It's not worth it!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Petunia," Okay, make it three dollars."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Sal, Yuck! I don't wants no three-dollar hooker.  I'm goin' backs to the adults bookstore.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Fry, Adult bookstore?  I thought this was the public library.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Bender," [pointing to the words on a pedastil] Nope, pubic library."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela," Zapp?  Where are you? [to herself] Oh, God, I'm actually starting to miss him."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Snake, Maybe you two belong together.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, We do not.  And you can't talk.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Snake," Oh, come on!  It must be an awful temptation. [slithers away]"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,[Zapp returns with a wood pile],
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,<poem>Zapp," Guess who just killed a woodchuck with his bare feet? [puts the wood down] I thought I'd whip us up some shelter, make this a little more like home."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, I do miss the Earth terribly.  I wonder if it's even still there.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, Let's find out together.  I'll brave the ship's wreckage to fetch you the telescope. [exits]
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, That's so sweet.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Snake, I'm just sayin' is all.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth," I know my new plan is a long shot, but it's the only hope left."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Hermes," Well, now I've heard everything [the camera cuts to a closeup of his face revealing he has earbuds in his ears, which he takes out] on my eyePod.  So, do you have a new plan, Professor, and is there any hope left?"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth, Indeed.  We're here on Earth's last unspoiled acre to show the death sphere there's still purity in the world.  Begin transmitting.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth, Commence purity chant.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Fry," Hey, I'm proud of you, Bender. Avoiding sin for almost a full minute.  [opens his eyes to reveal that Zoidberg is now holding his hand] Bender?"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Bender (v.o.)," Aw, yeah, baby. You're quite a dish."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,[The crew looks behind the satellite dish. We hear female giggling.  The camera cuts to reveal that Bender is sticking his plug into the satellite dish's input implying that he's having intercourse with the dish.],
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,<poem>Farnsworth," Bender, stop!! STOP!!"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Bender," Aw, quiet, you riot.  What's the worst that could happen?"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela (v.o.), No!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, No! [sobs] Earth is gone!  We're the only two humans left in the universe! [cries]
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," Oh, God, I'm sorry, Leela. [comforts her]"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, Maybe —[sniffles] Maybe this was meant to be. Maybe you and I were meant to build a new world here.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, We can avoid humanity's mistakes.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, Like the tuba.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, Yes.  We'll be like Adam and Eve.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, Only without the tuba.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, And we'll beget little Zapp Jr. and Leela Jr. and they'll have kids of their ow—Yecch!  Is that really what happened in the Bible?!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, It's a sick and twisted book of holiness all right.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," Then we'll write our own Bible, with less Sodom and more Gomorra."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela," Let's do it.  I shall become the mother of a new world, trapped here under this tree. [reaches out her hand] The Tree of Knowledge!  Look, it even has apples! [one falls down on her head] Ow! [she catches it with her hand] Wow! [she takes a bite and looks at Zapp seductively] Come here, Adam, partake of my forbidden fruit."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, Thee will be done.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela," Wait!  One more bite before we begin the begetting.  [eats the apple] Mmm, juicy.  Those nut berries you found were so salty, I—I couldn't think straight. [resumes kissing Zapp] I mean, not to belabor it, but they were as salty as that bag of trail mix Fry gave me. [has a thought] Exactly as salty.  Hey!  Wait a second! [pulls away from Zapp's embrace]"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, Uh...woh...ih...Giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiih—I have a terrible confession to make!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp (v.o.)," You see, when I first went foraging, what I actually found was the smoldering wreckage of the ship.  Ignoring all danger, I charged inside to liberate our provisions."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, So this is the trail mix Fry gave me!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, Yes!  I exaggerated when I said I picked it from the treetops.  I just wanted you to think [sniffles] a little better of me.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela," Well, your motives were good.  And we were both loopy from dehydration. [suddenly realizes] Hey, wait!  You've been doing an awful lot of urinating!"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," Ooooooiiiiiiigeeeaaaaaaaaaah, there's plenty of water! You see..."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,[Flashback, A naked Zapp goes back to the ship taking out an indigo miniature refrigerator full of water bottles and drinks one.]
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,<poem>Zapp (v.o.)," ...after I selflessly rescued the trail mix, I braved the flames once more in search of fluids."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, Then why didn't you give me any?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, [sniffles] I though it might help you forget your intense hatred for me if you were a teensy bit delirious.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, So you let me dehydrate while you washed down the trail mix with imported mineral water?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," Diiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaah, not exactly."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,[Flashback, Zapp opens the fridge to reveal that there were many food items including a box of chocolates.  He eats one.]
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,<poem>Zapp (v.o.)," You see, besides the trail mix, the minibar also contained Doritos, beef jerky and a generous assortment of fine chocolates."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," I wanted to offer you the chocolates, I truly did.  But I was concerned about your waistline.  Very concerned."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela," It's because I haven't been exercising.  If only this tree hadn't fallen on me by chance.  [realizes again] Oh, dear God!"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," Gluuuuuuuuyiiiiiiiiiiiih, it was just after we crashed!"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp (v.o.), I awoke first to find you trapped.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, Leela.  Leela! Wake up!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, You could've moved this grub-infested log anytime you wanted?!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," Well, sure.  But then I wouldn't have been able to provide the loving care you wouldn't have needed."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela," I'd leave you to rot in this paradise if only the ship weren't destroyed! [realizes] The ship's fully functional, isn't it?"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," Ee-iiiiiiiiiiiiiiih, you see..."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp (v.o.)," ...after re-trapping you and before feigning unconsciousness, I paused to enjoy a cigar.  Though mellow and satisfying, it did parch me a bit.  So I went in search of brandy.  That's when my keen senses detected the still invisible ship."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, Ow!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, So we can go back to Earth?  But there is no Earth anymore!  Everyone I know is dead! [sits down on the log and sobs]
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Fry," Ah, this seems like a good place to take a dump. [about to do his business but then sees Leela] Leela? You're alive! [runs to her]"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, Fry! [they hug] But how did you find this planet? [looks at Zapp menacingly] Well?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," Oooheeeeeeaaaaiiiiiiih, we're actually on Earth!  The ship's homing device brought us back!"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, But I saw Earth explode!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, [sniffles] I'm actually kinda proud of this one.  You see...
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp (v.o.), What you saw was merely a simulation I rigged up using the ship's holographic targeting projector.  The alleged telescope was a toilet paper tube.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, You said there wasn't any toilet paper!  And that humanity was annihilated!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, My motives were pure!  I just wanted you think we had to save humanity so you'd be willing to have sex.  Please say you believe me.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, Yes.  I believe you.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Fry, Yay!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Bender," There must be somethin' to steal on this island.  Hey, it's Leela!"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,[Everyone cheers],
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,<poem>Leela," Let's go home, everybody.  At least the Earth wasn't destroyed. [The V-GINY suddenly approaches the island.] Yet."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,V-GINY," People of Earth, hear the righteous word of the Mighty V-GINY!"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Bender, The Mighty V-GINY!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,V-GINY, Seeing you frolic in this unspoiled garden gives hope that this world may yet be redeemed.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Farnsworth, Huzzah!  The purity chant worked!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,V-GINY, Unacceptable wardrobe malfunction!  I was referring to Adam and Eve.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela," We're not Adam and Eve.  You see, due to a series of—"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,V-GINY, Consummate your union or I shall destroy Earth!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela," Well, if it's to save Earth, I-I guess I could take one for the team."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp," You what?  R-Right now?  Eh, but I need a little romance, first.  Maybe a vanilla candle or something."
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,V-GINY, Commence intercourse.
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, [clears throat] The giant guns are making me feel sort of...inadequate.  I'm not sure if I could—
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela, [sighs and pushes Zapp to an area where they can make love] Move it!  I gotta get home and do laundry!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Fry," For God's sake, censor it!!! CENSOR IT!!!"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,V-GINY, Approved for all audiences!!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Fry, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Transition Announcer," And now, the spicy finale of The Transcredible Exploits of Zapp Brannigan!"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Zapp, That was a close call but we saved Earth.  Was it as good for you as it was for the human race?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,Leela Actress," Oh, Zapp, let's save another planet right now!"
In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela,,
Attack of the Killer App,,
Attack of the Killer App,Poopenmeyer," As mayor, it is my deeply tedious pleasure to kick off the 83rd or 84th Annual e-Waste Recycling Festival!"
Attack of the Killer App,Bender, Down in front!
Attack of the Killer App,Zoidberg," Sorry, I get aroused in crowds."
Attack of the Killer App,Poopenmeyer, I will now throw out the ceremonial first dump  [takes an old machine that says Elect-O-Matic 2000 and is about to put it in the recycling bin] this old inefficient vote rigger! [throws it away as the crowd cheers and the fin grows back on Zoidberg's head]
Attack of the Killer App,[Cut to," Farnsworth and Hermes carry a box labeled ""Old Doomsday Devices"" to the bin]"
Attack of the Killer App,<poem>Farnsworth, These old doomsday devices are dangerously unstable.  I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.
Attack of the Killer App,Leela," So long, overly complicated Japanese toilet!"
Attack of the Killer App,Toilet," [in a stereotypical Japanese accent] Please.  I not to throw away.  I give you, uh, Happy Poopie Time."
Attack of the Killer App,Fry," Sorry, you know too much."
Attack of the Killer App,Bender," Seems like a good place to ditch some evidence. [takes something out of his cavity, opens the bin and finds a familiar robot] Flexo?!  What are you doin' in a hazardous wastebin?"
Attack of the Killer App,Flexo," Haven't you heard?  Us bending units are dangerously outdated.  We overheat, we're radioactive, we cause erectile dysfun—"
Attack of the Killer App,Farnsworth, Who were you talking to?
Attack of the Killer App,Bender, [slides the evidence with his footcup under the bin] No one? Your mama? Shut up? Take your pick.
Attack of the Killer App,Scoop Chang," Scoop Chang, New New York Times Online Podcast blog comments editor.  Mr. Mayor, isn't this e-waste dangerous?"
Attack of the Killer App,Poopenmeyer," Not at all, Scoop. Not after it's hauled off to the Third World by an expendable team of minimum-wage nobodies."
Attack of the Killer App,Farnsworth," [whispering to the other three] Good news, nobodies!"
Attack of the Killer App,Antarian #1," Greetings, my friends. It shan't take long to strip down your clunker. [knocks the staircase twice]"
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, There's nothing wrong with our clunker.
Attack of the Killer App,Antarian #1," Really? Because we can smelt out the deadly, deadly chromium to make rat poison and artificial sweeteners."
Attack of the Killer App,Leela," No, thanks. We're delivering e-waste."
Attack of the Killer App,Antarian #1, Pity. We're halfway done.
Attack of the Killer App,Antarian #2, This thing is 40% chromium.
Attack of the Killer App,Antarian #1, Gentle now.  Gentle with the hover dumpster.
Attack of the Killer App,Antarian #1," Ready for processing! [squirts the oil, takes out a match, lights it, and spreads it on the oil]"
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, [sniffs as his nose bleeds] What smells like bloody sinuses?
Attack of the Killer App,Antarian #1," We burn your e-waste down to the usable metals, safely releasing the toxins into our air and drinking water."
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, Uch!  That's the worst thing I've ever seen!
Attack of the Killer App,Antarian #1," Really? Then don't look over there. [points to a bunch of Antarian children playing in a pile of e-Waste, to the kids] Okay, kids, let's play Find the Shiny!"
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, That's even more horrific! Is all the work done by children?
Attack of the Killer App,Antarian #1, No. Not the whipping.
Attack of the Killer App,[We hear three whip cracks.],
Attack of the Killer App,[Scene, Exterior shot of the Planet Express building.]
Attack of the Killer App,[Scene," Interior shot of the Planet Express living room.  Fry and Bender are on the couch, Leela is standing up, while everyone else is sitting at the table.]"
Attack of the Killer App,<poem>Leela," Granted, we later learned some positive things about recycling.  But a better solution is to use our electronics as long as possible, instead of throwing them out in the first place. [walks toward the trash can]  I'm gonna start by keeping my old cell phone, even if it is outdated."
Attack of the Killer App,Phone," [like an old 1930's switchboard operator] Hello, Miss Turanga, your call to St. Louis has gone through."
Attack of the Killer App,Bender," [grabbing the television]  Well, let's at least throw this TV out. [rips it from the wall] The batteries in the remote are gettin' low."
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, No! Put that back and turn it on!
Attack of the Killer App,Bender, I was just tryin' to help. [puts the television back on the wall as Fry turns it on with the remote]
Attack of the Killer App,Morbo, More on this breaking puff piece after a word from our sponsor.
Attack of the Killer App,Announcer," WIth the new eyePhone, you can watch, listen, ignore your friends, stalk your ex, download porno on a crowded bus, even check your E-mail while getting hit by a train.  All with the new eyePhone."
Attack of the Killer App,Mom (v.o.), From Mom.
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, A new eyePhone? Forget this junk. [throws out her cell phone again]
Attack of the Killer App,Phone," Well, this is a fine howdoyoudo."
Attack of the Killer App,Hermes, [throws out his BlackBerry] So long.
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, [throws out his phone] Sayonara.
Attack of the Killer App,Amy, [throws out her miniature cell phone] Buh-bye.
Attack of the Killer App,Zoidberg, [throws out his shell phone] Good riddance.
Attack of the Killer App,Bender, [throws out his old wireless phone] Yep.
Attack of the Killer App,Farnsworth, [throws out his even older wireless phone] Toodle-oo!
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, Come on!  Let's buy some eyePhones on line!
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, Wait.  I thought we were buying our eyePhones online.
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, We are on line.
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, But I thought the Mom Store was across town.
Attack of the Killer App,Amy, It is across town.
Attack of the Killer App,[Whip pan to reveal that the store is indeed all the way across town by the look of the line.  Cut back to the Planet Express crew.],
Attack of the Killer App,<poem>Fry, But I thought—
Attack of the Killer App,Bender," Stop thinking, Fry!"
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, I feel like a mindless zombie.  I wish I knew how long we've been waiting.
Attack of the Killer App,Beeler, The eyePhone has an app for that!
Attack of the Killer App,Bender, Is there an app for kissin' my shiny metal ass?
Attack of the Killer App,Beeler, Several!
Attack of the Killer App,Bender, Ooooooh!
Attack of the Killer App,Farnsworth," Oh, no!  The light!  I guess I'm off to Hell."
Attack of the Killer App,Hermes," That's the store, Professor."
Attack of the Killer App,Farnsworth, Eh-wha?
Attack of the Killer App,Amy, Shwow! It's that obscure underground song that's constantly playing everywhere.
Attack of the Killer App,Mom," [in her sweet voice] Hello, dearies.  Welcome to the Mom Store.  The new eyePhones are in short supply, so please form an orderly—"
Attack of the Killer App,Bender, Outta the way!
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, [panting] Are there any left?
Attack of the Killer App,Salesman, There may be one.
Attack of the Killer App,Salesman," Okay, it's $500, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold a charge and the reception isn't very—"
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, [taking out a wad of cash] Shut up and take my money!!
Attack of the Killer App,Mom, The new eyePhone is wonderful. I use it to check recipes and send threatening e-mails to unauthorized third party app developers.
Attack of the Killer App,Fry," Say, you're from one of those ethnicities that knows about technology.  Why's it called an eyePhone?"
Attack of the Killer App,Salesman, I'll explain after I install it.
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, Neat.
Attack of the Killer App,Salesman," [putting an earpiece in Fry's left ear] Now for the earpiece. [lifts a huge mallet, but we don't see him hammer it in, instead, we pan back to the video screen]"
Attack of the Killer App,Mom," But my favorite app is called ""Twitcher"". [we hear the salesman hammer in the earpiece] Twitcher lets you send and receive short messages or videos called ""twits"". [we hear a ding] Why, [blinks her eyes and activates a floating screen showing Larry] here's a twit now."
Attack of the Killer App,Larry," Hi, Mom, I love you more than Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar—"
Attack of the Killer App,eyePhone, Low battery.
Attack of the Killer App,Mom," But don't take my word for it. [a screen showing a web site appears, which Mom reads] Unbiasedreviews.mom says, ""Twitcher is the Killer App!"""
Attack of the Killer App,Mom," [normal voice] And when I say, ""killer app"", I mean, ""KILLER app!"""
Attack of the Killer App,Announcer," And now, another downloadisode of ""The Real Housewives of Sim City""!"
Attack of the Killer App,Sims Woman, She needs to reset.  I'll say it to her face.
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, No wonder traditional media is dead!  Check out this webisode of Hypnotoad.
Attack of the Killer App,Bender," Enjoy your outdated format, Grandpa.  [blinks his eyes to open an episode of All My Circuits] Nowadays, cool kids like me mash up our own phoneisodes."
Attack of the Killer App,Calculon, It's from the kidnappers.  My nephew is alive and he's...in this envelope.
Attack of the Killer App,Calculon's Nephew, [looking flat] They cut off one of my dimensions!
Attack of the Killer App,Calculon, [as Monique sobs] No.  No!
Attack of the Killer App,Bender," [on screen] Oh, my God! It's Bender! He'll save us!"
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, What's happening to me?  Is it puberty?
Attack of the Killer App,Bender," It's a phone call, dingus."
Attack of the Killer App,Fry," These eyePhones are phones, too?"
Attack of the Killer App,Bender, Duh!
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, Fry-lo.
Attack of the Killer App,Leela," [on screen] Hi, Fry.  Did you know these eyePhones are phones, too?"
Attack of the Killer App,Fry," Duh.  Hey, is it safe to talk while you're flying?"
Attack of the Killer App,Leela," [on screen] Oh, totally.  This thing's hands-free.  [takes out a taco] That's how I can eat this taco [takes out a fork with spaghetti in another hand] and this spaghetti."
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, I'm hanging up now.  [Fry and Leela touch their noses and hang up]
Attack of the Killer App,Bender," Hey, check out this Internet video of some idiot crashing her spaceship!"
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, You recorded that?
Attack of the Killer App,Bender," The eyePhone records everything.  All I did was add a laugh track and twit it to my 10,000 followers."
Attack of the Killer App,Fry," Oh, that reminds me.  It's time to twit my hourly twupdate. [Fry records a twit on his eyePhone]  'Sup, followers?  Fry here. [belches] Burpin' eggs. [scratches his armpit] Scratchin' my underarm fungus.  Lookin' for love.  Send."
Attack of the Killer App,Larry, Underarm fungus? [gasps] Too much informatio—[Mom slaps him] OW!
Attack of the Killer App,Mom," It's exactly the right amount of information!  For years, I've collected personal data with old-fashioned methods like spybots and infosquitoes."
Attack of the Killer App,Infosquito, This guy sure loves porno.
Attack of the Killer App,Mom," But now, thanks to Twitcher, morons voluntarily spew out every fact I need to exploit them."
Attack of the Killer App,Walt," Target acquired, Mother."
Attack of the Killer App,Mom, Fire direct marketing algorithm!
Attack of the Killer App,Man, Do you suffer from the heartbreak of...?
Attack of the Killer App,Fry's Voice," ""—my underarm fungus."""
Attack of the Killer App,Man," Then, you, Mr. or Mrs. ... [we hear a soundbite of Fry belching], need the soothing relief of Mom's Caustic Anti-Fungal Bleach!"
Attack of the Killer App,Fry," Ooh, can I somehow charge it to my eyePhone for an additional fee?"
Attack of the Killer App,Mom (v.o.)," Hell, yes!"
Attack of the Killer App,Ad," Hey, fatso, stuffa you face!"
Attack of the Killer App,Hermes, [gasps] This thing always seems to know when I get the munchies! [closes Space Invaders and opens Twitcher] Attention followers  It's Free Topping Day at the pizza place across the street! Send.
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, [twitting] Duh. That's why we all came over here for lunch. Send.
Attack of the Killer App,Bender," [twitting] Greetings, followers  This is Day Five of my solo kayak journey around the world.  Send. [laughs to himself, to Hermes] Can you believe 50,000 idiots swallow that crap? Send. Oops."
Attack of the Killer App,Fry," [twitting to Bender] You have 50,000 followers? I only have three. Send."
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, I unsubscribed yesterday.
Attack of the Killer App,Bender," I got the most followers cuz I give the people what they want, like this video of you doin' karate in your underpants."
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, [on screen] Help!  Police!
Attack of the Killer App,Bender, Send.
Attack of the Killer App,Fry," That is low, Bender.  Even by your standards."
Attack of the Killer App,Bender," My what, now?"
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, Since when is the internet about robbing people of their privacy?
Attack of the Killer App,Bender," August 6, 1991."
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, I'll bet I can get as many followers as you without sinking to your level.  What do you say?  First one to a million followers wins a buck.
Attack of the Killer App,Bender, [stands up to shake Fry's hand] You're on! [ends up shocking Fry] Send.
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, What happens to the loser?
Attack of the Killer App,Bender, Let's make it interesting.
Attack of the Killer App,Amy, Splech!  Why is Mr. Chunks doing that?
Attack of the Killer App,Bender, Because the loser of our bet has to do a double somersault into a tub of alien goat vomit. [giggles]
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, Wait!  Let's make it interestinger! [the camera cuts to reveal that the goat has two heads as Fry turns it around] Vomit and diarrhea!
Attack of the Killer App,Bender," Good idea!  That way, we don't waste an end!"
Attack of the Killer App,Leela," [brushing away the smell] Eg, it's putrid! What do you feed him?"
Attack of the Killer App,Bender, What comes out one end we feed to the other.  Also Indian food.  Let the contest begin!
Attack of the Killer App,[Montage," We see a ""Twit Meter"" with two thermometers and follower counters, one for Bender, who currently has 50,000 followers, and one for Fry, who currently has only 37.  We see a video being recorded of Farnsworth doing an experiment with Diet Solarmanite and Mentos.  He drops all the Mentos in the drink, it explodes.  Literally.  He ends up setting himself on fire.  It is revealed that Bender was the one recording that.  As a result, his Twit Meter goes up to 200,000 followers.  Next, we see Fry recording a video in front of a whiteboard with ""My Politicle Views  Part 56 Tariffs"" on it. We don't hear what he's saying.  As a result, his Twit Meter goes down to 19 followers.  Next we see Amy in front of the same whiteboard wearing a bikini and pumps.  Again, we see that Bender is recording that video.  His Twit Meter goes up to 800,000 followers.]"
Attack of the Killer App,[Scene, Interior shot of Mom's office.  Mom is watching the Twit Meters on her computer.]
Attack of the Killer App,<poem>Mom," Amazing.  Some dumb bastard has nearly a million other dumb bastards following his every twit.  [to her sons] Are you dumb bastards listening to me, you dumb bastards?"
Attack of the Killer App,Igner," Why are you so angry, Mommy?"
Attack of the Killer App,Mom," Oh, I'm sorry.  I guess I'm just a little nervous about my evil plan.  YOU DUMB BASTARDS!!! [she triple slaps all three of her sons]  You see, the plan is about to enter phase two.  As soon as someone reaches a million followers, I'll use them to transmit...the Twitworm!"
Attack of the Killer App,Walt," Oh, Mother, you devious hag, tell us more about this ""Twitworm""."
Attack of the Killer App,Mom," It's a very special computer virus, for instead of infecting computers, it infects...the human brain!"
Attack of the Killer App,Infosquito, I like it!
Attack of the Killer App,Mom, The million followers will become an army of zombies eager to obey my every command! [laughs evilly]
Attack of the Killer App,Larry, The important thing is we're a family.
Attack of the Killer App,Mom, NO IT'S NOT!
Attack of the Killer App,Amy, Ew!  He sneezed in it!
Attack of the Killer App,Fry," Oh, God, I'm gonna lose the bet!  I'm gonna have to swim in the juice of the puke-me-poop-yu!"
Attack of the Killer App,Amy, Don't give up.  You just need more titillating twits.
Attack of the Killer App,Fry," Trust me, I want twits that tittle."
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, Then you're gonna have to sink to Bender's level. Stop acting like the Queen of England.
Attack of the Killer App,Female Voice, [singing] La la la la la la la!
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, Whose that?  The Queen of England?
Attack of the Killer App,Leela," [gets out of her lounge chair] Uh, e-e-excuse me.  I have to...someplace. [takes her towel and exits]"
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, That was odd.  Where'd that singing come from?
Attack of the Killer App,Amy, It wasn't the goat.  All of its orifices are in use.
Attack of the Killer App,Female Voice, [singing in a Scottish accent] I dreamed a dream in time gone by...
Attack of the Killer App,Leela and Female Voice, [singing] When hope was high and life worth living.
Attack of the Killer App,I dreamed that love would never die.,
Attack of the Killer App,Susan, [still singing] I dreamed that God would be forgiving.
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, What the hell is that?
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, [hides the boil with a towel] Nothing.
Attack of the Killer App,Susan," I'm not nothing!  All my life, everyone's called me, ""nothing""!"
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, You have a boil on your butt that sings showtunes with you?
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, Don't look at me!  I'm a freak!
Attack of the Killer App,Fry," No, no.  [shrugs] Well..."
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, [sighs] I've been ashamed of Susan as long as I can remember.
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, You named your boil Susan?
Attack of the Killer App,Susan," A boil cannae have a name. He also said a boil cannae sing.  But... [sings] Amazing grace, how— [Leela pops Susan with a knife as she deflates and disappears]"
Attack of the Killer App,Fry," Ew, she's Scottish!"
Attack of the Killer App,Leela," [puts a bandage on the spot where the boil was] I lance her every few months, but she always grows back. [sobs] It's hard enough being a cyclops, but if anyone found out about Susan, I'd be devastated."
Attack of the Killer App,Susan," [singing on Fry's eyePhone] Amazing grace, how— [she screams when she gets popped]"
Attack of the Killer App,Fry," Woah, gross. [gets inspired] Million follower gross."
Attack of the Killer App,Leela," Fry, delete that! Delete that right now!"
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, What?  Oh.  Okay.
Attack of the Killer App,Bender, [giggling and taking hot sauce out of his cavity and pouring it into the vomit] So much for a pleasant swim in vomit.
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, [fake coughing and whispering] Send [fake coughing again]
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, Did you delete it?
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, [in horror] Eh.
Attack of the Killer App,Leela," Thanks, Fry. [sniffles] You're a good friend."
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, Ih.
Attack of the Killer App,Susan," [on screen singing] Amazing grace, how— [screams]"
Attack of the Killer App,[Scene," New New York, a construction site.  Sal and Hoschel are watching the video on their eyePhones on their lunch break.  They laugh.]"
Attack of the Killer App,<poem>Hoschel," [pointing to Leela] Hey, there she goes in the jen-you-ine!  Let's get ta hootin'! [to Leela] HOOOOOOOOOO!"
Attack of the Killer App,Sal, Whoa-whoa-whoas!  If it ain'ts the world's number ones internet sensation!
Attack of the Killer App,Leela," Where?  Also, what?"
Attack of the Killer App,Susan (v.o.), [singing] Ama-
Attack of the Killer App,Susan (v.o.)," [singing] -zing grace, how [screams]"
Attack of the Killer App,Hermes, Play it one more time!
Attack of the Killer App,Farnsworth, No! It's humiliating and degrading to Leela!  Play it ten more times!
Attack of the Killer App,Fry," [sighs] I know I shouldn't have twitted that but [he looks at the Twit Meter, which now has Bender at 934,802 followers and Fry just growing and growing inching closer to the same number of followers as Bender] not swimming in barf might ease my conscience."
Attack of the Killer App,Zoidberg," But if Leela should find out, her dignity sac will rupture."
Attack of the Killer App,Fry," That's why we can't let her see this.  Leela, lock the doors so Leela doesn't—EEEEE!"
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, [sobbing] How could you do this?!!
Attack of the Killer App,Amy, Poor Mr. Chunks.  At least he died doing what he loved.
Attack of the Killer App,Bender, He's in a better place now.
Attack of the Killer App,[Pan up to reveal a window where Scruffy is setting up a diving board for the loser.],
Attack of the Killer App,<poem>Scruffy, There.  I turned a regular board into a divin' board. [flicks it]  Mm-hmm.
Attack of the Killer App,Farnsworth," Impending news, everyone!  We're about to learn the winner of the bet!"
Attack of the Killer App,Bender," Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! [whispers to Amy] I hope it's me!"
Attack of the Killer App,[Scene," Interior shot of the Planet Express meeting room.  Bender, Hermes, Zoidberg, Amy, Fry, and Farnsworth are gathered around watching the Twit Meter on the holographic projector.  Each counter keeps growing and growing in followers.]"
Attack of the Killer App,<poem>Bender, Wait a minute!  There's a chance I could lose?  That wasn't part of the deal!
Attack of the Killer App,Hermes," Sweet Georgia Brown of Kingston Town! It's a tie!  Since no one lost, no one has to jump!"
Attack of the Killer App,Bender," Alright, a tie! I win again!! [points to Fry as if to say, ""In your face!""]"
Attack of the Killer App,Fry," Oh, I'm a scuzzball."
Attack of the Killer App,Zoidberg, Don't feel bad.  At least you're not Leela.
Attack of the Killer App,Mom, A tie?  This worked out better than I could have hoped!  Now I'll have two million zombies!
Attack of the Killer App,Walt," Actually, Fry and Bender may share some of the same followers.  All we can say for sure is that there will be between one million and two million zombies."
Attack of the Killer App,Mom, All I can say for sure is... [slaps Walt] Now stop getting slapped and power up the Twitworm!
Attack of the Killer App,Hoschel," It's both disgusting and inspiring, like Jared from Subway."
Attack of the Killer App,Leela," Okay, I'm a freak with a singing butt boil, but I'm still a human being more or less."
Attack of the Killer App,Sal, Singin' butts boil?  That's yesterday'ses news.
Attack of the Killer App,Hoschel, Like that giant caterpillar what ate Jared from Subway.
Attack of the Killer App,Sal, Nows us internet geeks gots a whole new video sensation.
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, So my humiliation is over?
Attack of the Killer App,Sal, Who are you?
Attack of the Killer App,Mom," And now, to create an unstoppable army of between one and two million zombies!"
Attack of the Killer App,Igner," Uh, shouldn't you wait for the weather to clear up?"
Attack of the Killer App,Mom, No!  I give you...the Twitworm! [pulls up a huge switch on the machine] Send.
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, Aaah!  I'm sick of my head doing things! [Leela comes up to him] Leela!
Attack of the Killer App,Leela,"  Fry, I came to talk to you."
Attack of the Killer App,Fry," No, I came to talk to you."
Attack of the Killer App,Leela," It looked like you were just sitting there, but whatever."
Attack of the Killer App,Fry," I am so, so sorry for what I did.  And I know I can never make it up to you."
Attack of the Killer App,Leela," You don't have to apologize.  In fact, I came to thank you."
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, I think you mean hit me.
Attack of the Killer App,Leela," Everyone knows my secret, but no one cares.  I have nothing to hide anymore.  Oh, Fry, thanks to your selfish rudeness, a terrible weight has been lifted from my heart!"
Attack of the Killer App,Susan (v.o.), That's not the only place you need a terrible weight lifted!
Attack of the Killer App,Leela," Susan and I are agreed.  For the first time in our lives, we're not ashamed of who we are."
Attack of the Killer App,Susan (v.o.), I was never ashamed.
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, Come here.  [she hugs Fry but then smells something] What stinks?  Were you rolling around in New Jersey?
Attack of the Killer App,Fry," Leela, I knew I could never make it up to you, so I did the next best thing.  I put myself through the same humiliation I put you through."
Attack of the Killer App,Leela," Aw, you didn't have to do that."
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, I didn't? Damn.
Attack of the Killer App,Leela," Don't worry.  By tomorrow, no one will remember."
Attack of the Killer App,Fry, Can I have another hug?
Attack of the Killer App,Leela, No.
Attack of the Killer App,Susan (v.o.)," Oh, hold yer nose an' give it a go!"
Attack of the Killer App,Mom (v.o.), Introducing the all new eyePhone 2.0!
Attack of the Killer App,Mom, Dumb bastards.
Attack of the Killer App,,
Proposition Infinity,,
Proposition Infinity,Linda, [on TV] We now go live to our eye-in-the-sky hovercopter on the scene of that terrible hovercopter crash. Jim?
Proposition Infinity,Jim," [on TV] [Still in the burning hovercopter.] The scene is not good, Linda. I've just learned that my last words were  back to you, Linda. [The hovercopter explodes.]"
Proposition Infinity,Linda, [on TV] [She laughs] One for the blooper reel.
Proposition Infinity,Kif," The news is so violent. Let's watch Rachael Ray instead. No, wait. There might be chopping."
Proposition Infinity,Amy," God, what a wuss. Stop being such a spineless jellyfish."
Proposition Infinity,Kif, You know full well that I am more closely related to the sea cucumber.
Proposition Infinity,Amy, Not where it counts.
Proposition Infinity,Morbo," [on TV] I hated Jim! In other news, our city's urine-soaked walls have been desicrated by a mysterious tile-work graffiti artist."
Proposition Infinity,Linda, [on TV] Police have no idea who is behind this innovative scourge of public art.
Proposition Infinity,Bender, [He chuckles maliciously and spreads grout onto a wall. He then makes a tile version of his head] That is one sexy bridge abutment.
Proposition Infinity,Hyper-Chicken, Free corn? That'll suit me just fine. [He crashes his hovercar and crows loudly]
Proposition Infinity,Bender, The key is knowing precisely where to strike. [The last building turns out to be URL's back] Oops!
Proposition Infinity,URL," Well, well. Time to beat him his rights. [He and Smitty take out their lightsabers and being hitting Bender.]"
Proposition Infinity,Smitty," You know, that don't look half bad on your buttocks."
Proposition Infinity,URL, It does sorta class-up the place.
Proposition Infinity,Clock, The time is 4 am.
Proposition Infinity,Amy," We've been arguing all night, Kif. Can't we go to bed?"
Proposition Infinity,Kif," Is that all you ever think about? I'm not just some piece of tofu, Amy. I need to know where we stand in our relationship."
Proposition Infinity,Amy, We're just going through a rough patch.
Proposition Infinity,Kif," It is not a patch. It's been ages, according to your wildly inappropriate ""Hunk of the Month"" calender."
Proposition Infinity,Amy, Leave Todd out of this!
Proposition Infinity,Todd," Thanks, babe. Also, today is Canadian Independence Day. [He plays a tune]"
Proposition Infinity,Amy," Oh, that's Bender's ringtone. I recognize the smell. Hello? [Bender's picture is displayed over the phone]"
Proposition Infinity,Bender," Yo, Amy, I'm in the slammer."
Proposition Infinity,Amy," Oh, no!"
Proposition Infinity,Bender," That's enough lip from you, moneybags. Just get 5 grand an bail me out."
Proposition Infinity,Amy, I don't have that kind of money laying around.
Proposition Infinity,Bender," Yeah, you do. You know that floor safe where you keep 10 grand? There's 5 grand in there. Don't make me wait!"
Proposition Infinity,Roberto," [He walks up to Bender. He is holding a sock] Hey, Bender. Ever kill a man with a sock? It ain't so hard. Ha-HAA. [He stabs at Bender]"
Proposition Infinity,Bender, I better carve a shiv for protection. [He pulls out a stick and a switchblade. He starts whittling down the stick into a crude knife]
Proposition Infinity,URL, [He opens the cell door. Kif and Amy are with him.] Rodríguez! These two brothers bailed your ass out.
Proposition Infinity,Bender," Oh! Thank God. [He hugs Kif, causing his head to inflate] Tell me, have things changed on the outside. Is food finally in pill form? What about pills? Are they in food form?"
Proposition Infinity,Larry the Murder Burglar," [To Amy] Hey, hot stuff. I'm Larry the Murder Burglar."
Proposition Infinity,Amy," Hi, Larry. I like your tattoos."
Proposition Infinity,Kif," Amy, that man's a criminal!"
Proposition Infinity,Amy, I was just checking out his tats. [She looks at a tattoo of Larry jumping out of a house window then lighting it with a molotov cocktail. The house explodes.] Sneato! I have one of my mom. Wanna see?
Proposition Infinity,Larry the Murder Burglar, Sure.
Proposition Infinity,Kif, [To Amy] I just don't understand why you have to flirt with every bad boy in sight.
Proposition Infinity,Amy, Quit exaggerating.
Proposition Infinity,Criminal," Nobody move, or sweet cheeks here gets it!"
Proposition Infinity,Amy, [Giggling] Oh! You're bad!
Proposition Infinity,URL," [He performs the Vulcan Neck Pinch on the criminal] Momma said, Spock you out!"
Proposition Infinity,Kif," That's it, Amy. Pardon my language, but I have had it with you ruffling my petticoats. You and I are through. [He walks off. Amy looks heartbroken.]"
Proposition Infinity,Bender," [He is holding the accordion.] Aw! Here's a little song I wrote to cheer you up. It's called, [singing] Let's go already!"
Proposition Infinity,Leela," Here's to Amy, single, lonely, and fabulous."
Proposition Infinity,Amy, Thanks everybody. Looks like I'm back in the game.
Proposition Infinity,Bender," Yeah, the game of Old Maid. [He laughs]"
Proposition Infinity,Security woman," Excuse me, sir, are those yours? [Bender is wearing Chewbacca's feet]"
Proposition Infinity,Bender," You're damn right. And, before you ask, this is mine too. [He opens his chest cabinet revealing Lassie. She barks]"
Proposition Infinity,Fry," Tough break, Amy. Are you and Kif getting divorced?"
Proposition Infinity,Amy," No. Technically we were Fonfon rus, so we weren't really married."
Proposition Infinity,Bender, Wow! The interesting thing about that is [He starts snoring]
Proposition Infinity,Leela," So, Amy, how can I phrase this delicately? Why did Kif dump you like a sack of yesterday's turds?"
Proposition Infinity,Amy, He says I have a thing for bad boys. It's so stupid.
Proposition Infinity,Bender, The truth is often stupid. [He blows smoke in her face and sprinkles her with ash]
Proposition Infinity,Amy," Bender, why do you have to be so mean to me?"
Proposition Infinity,Bender," Shut up, baby, you love it."
Proposition Infinity,Amy, Don't tell me to shut up! You know what happened to the last guy that told me to shut up?
Proposition Infinity,Bender, What?
Proposition Infinity,Amy, That was great.
Proposition Infinity,Bender, Shut up. [Amy climbs on top of him and they start kissing] Come over here.
Proposition Infinity,Amy," Remember, love between a human and a robot is taboo. [She takes a brush from Bender's cabinet and fixes her hair.] We can't tell anyone, not even our co-workers."
Proposition Infinity,Bender, Got it. I'll show the utmost discretion as we get nasty in this glass tube. [They begin kissing]
Proposition Infinity,Hermes," I think I'm coming down with circusitis. [He sneezes and his face gets traditional clown fare  make-up, orange wig, and rubber nose.]"
Proposition Infinity,Leela, I thought circusitis only affected children.
Proposition Infinity,Hermes, Children of all ages.
Proposition Infinity,Zoidberg," Bender, old friend. What's on your face?"
Proposition Infinity,Bender," [He has a lipstick mark on his face. He covers it up.] Uh. Blood. You know, from shaving of the face-beard."
Proposition Infinity,Fry," Amy, are those gear imprints on your sweatpants?"
Proposition Infinity,Amy," Uh, maybe. So what?"
Proposition Infinity,Fry, I only brought it up because Bender is wearing them.
Proposition Infinity,Bender," [He clears his throat] Uh, I stole them from her. Yeah, that's it, call the cops."
Proposition Infinity,Hermes," Oh, my swollen feet. He takes his feet out of the tub of water. They have turned into clown shoes] I better take my pills. [He opens the container and rubber springs fly out]"
Proposition Infinity,Bender," Amy, I reckon sweet talk don't come natural to me, but of everyone I've ever dated, you are probably in the top ten."
Proposition Infinity,Amy," Aw, you always say just the wrong thing in just the right way. [They kiss]"
Proposition Infinity,Preacherbot, Sinners! Robosexuality is an abomination!
Proposition Infinity,Bender," Oy, this guy."
Proposition Infinity,Preacherbot," The good book sayeth a robot shall not lie down with a human, nor do it standing up, nor any angle in between."
Proposition Infinity,Bender, Look! A single mother! Let's get her! [The crowd runs off]
Proposition Infinity,Farnsworth," Quickly, into the ship's basement! [Dr. Zoidberg scrambles into the basement and closes the door behind him. Everyone else is already there.] Now, then, as you all know, the county fair is approaching once again, so I'm preparing my entry of pickled winds and weathers. [Pan over the individual jars of weather] I've got sunny, snow flurry, hail with onions, even my grandmother's cranberry-raisin typhoon, but no tornado. I'll be damned if I let Mrs. Girdleson take the blue ribbon again. [He opens some blinds revealing a farmhouse being blown away in a tornado, it has Bender's graffiti on it.] That's why I need you folks to get out there and harvest a nice ripe one. This cattle prod should help."
Proposition Infinity,Leela, How is that? [The Professor zaps with the prod and she screams.]
Proposition Infinity,Farnsworth, Get out there!
Proposition Infinity,Leela, Is everybody in position?
Proposition Infinity,Amy, What?
Proposition Infinity,Zoidberg, Is someone talking?
Proposition Infinity,Leela," Okay, good. On three. One."
Proposition Infinity,Hermes, What did she say?
Proposition Infinity,Leela, Two.
Proposition Infinity,Bender," Wait, I'm not in position. [He is being blown around by the winds]"
Proposition Infinity,Leela, Three.
Proposition Infinity,Zoidberg, I'm ready for the countdown.
Proposition Infinity,Leela, I'm not hearing anyone! Abort mission!
Proposition Infinity,Fry," She said, ""Go!"""
Proposition Infinity,Farnsworth," Good work, everyone. [A tornado has somehow been shoved into a large tube. It is attached to a pickle jar by a hose.]"
Proposition Infinity,Leela," Honestly, that went better than I expected."
Proposition Infinity,Farnsworth," I just need to reduce it down into this pickle jar, toss in a bay leaf to impress those stupid judges. [He puts the leaf into the pickle jar.]"
Proposition Infinity,Fry," Hey, where's Amy and Bender?"
Proposition Infinity,Zoidberg, They're missing out on some hot pickle action. [He licks his mouth flaps.]
Proposition Infinity,Hermes, Sounds like a muskrat's caught in there.
Proposition Infinity,Leela, That's Amy's sweatshirt!
Proposition Infinity,Fry, And that's Bender's hat from the Player's ball!
Proposition Infinity,Hermes, Sweet tornadoes of Barbados! Bender and Amy have been torn to shreds!
Proposition Infinity,Farnsworth," [He presses a few more buttons and more of Bender's and Amy's things appear in the whirlwind.] Oh, the humanity! Also Bender!"
Proposition Infinity,Amy," [The whirlwind whips faster revealing Bender and Amy. The tornado stops and they fall to the floor, still kissing.] Uh-oh!"
Proposition Infinity,Farnsworth, What's going on here?
Proposition Infinity,Bender, Uh. [He antenna recedes.] Nothing.
Proposition Infinity,Farnsworth, A pair of deviant robosexuals. Not under my roof!
Proposition Infinity,Bender, What about on the roof?
Proposition Infinity,Farnsworth, Get your mind out of the gutter!
Proposition Infinity,Bender, What about in the gutter?
Proposition Infinity,Leela," Professor, there is nothing wrong with robosexuality."
Proposition Infinity,Hermes," Yeah, when the lights go out, it's nobody's business what happens between two consenting adults."
Proposition Infinity,Zoidberg, Or one!
Proposition Infinity,Amy," Thanks, guys. Everything will be okay just as long as my parents don't find out."
Proposition Infinity,Farnsworth, Zai jian. [He hangs up his cellphone and begins whistling innocently and walks to the door. A doorbell rings. He opens it. Leo and Inez are there.]
Proposition Infinity,Amy, Mom? Dad?
Proposition Infinity,Leo," Come home, Amy. It your decision. We can't make you. [He pulls out a lasso and lassos Amy] Atta girl!"
Proposition Infinity,Bender, Uh-oh! not the innocent whistling!
Proposition Infinity,Preacherbot, [The doorbell rings and the Preacherbot is there] Repent!
Proposition Infinity,Bender," Oy, this guy. [A magnet attaches to his chest cabinet and he is dragged off.]"
Proposition Infinity,Inez," Look, we're your family. And if you can't talk about your problems with us, that would be great."
Proposition Infinity,Amy, I don't have a problem! I'm in a happy relationship that just happens to be robosex-
Proposition Infinity,Leo," [Cutting across her.] You finish that word, you kill your parents."
Proposition Infinity,Wine Bucket, Low wine level detected. [He fills Amy's glass]
Proposition Infinity,Amy, Thank you.
Proposition Infinity,Leo," Stop seducing him, you hussy!"
Proposition Infinity,Amy," Dad, gleesh! I'm attracted to Bender, not his emotionless wine bucket!"
Proposition Infinity,Wine Bucket, [A tear rolls down its face] Hopes deleted.
Proposition Infinity,Preacherbot," Robotic brothers, the path to Robot Hell is paved with human flesh."
Proposition Infinity,Bender, Neat!
Proposition Infinity,Preacherbot," Over the course of this escape-proof workshop, your software will be reprogrammed through prayer. And by some tech support guys in India."
Proposition Infinity,Robosexual Robot, But I read in Esqwired that some robots are hardwired to be robosexual.
Proposition Infinity,Preacherbot," Don't believe those lies, son! The one ones worth believing are the ones in the Bible. Can I get an ""Amen""?"
Proposition Infinity,Hermaphrobot," I'll take a-three-men, holla!"
Proposition Infinity,Inez," Come on, Amy! Pick a male human already! [There is a line of men standing near the porch.] I want to be a grandmother nine months from five minutes from now."
Proposition Infinity,Amy," Cut it out, Mom! I'm not interested in any of these gross, ugly losers."
Proposition Infinity,Fry," [Walking up] What about this gross, ugly, smelly loser?"
Proposition Infinity,Leo, Fry! What you doing here?
Proposition Infinity,Fry," I'm here to rescue Amy, uh... from her robosexual desires. [He winks.]"
Proposition Infinity,Amy," If I understand you correctly, I've seen the error of my ways? [She winks back.]"
Proposition Infinity,Leo, Look at all that awkward winking.
Proposition Infinity,Inez, It must be love. [Fry and Amy walk off]
Proposition Infinity,Amy," My parents may be evil, but at least they're stupid."
Proposition Infinity,Preacherbot," [The campers and the Preacherbot are standing near some dummies of humans.] In this phase, you will literally wrestle with your demons. Your shapely, buxom, human demons."
Proposition Infinity,Fatbot," Look at the rack on that one! Oh! I mean, that one on the rack!"
Proposition Infinity,Preacherbot," [He blows a whistle and the campers each jump on a dummy and start fondling them.] Good! That's real good! [He wipes away some sweat.] Okay, everybody switch demons. No point sticking with just one demon. [The campers all switch dummies.] Now, work it hard! Harder! Till the sin explodes! Ouch! Mmmm. Mercy. Okay, Lord's work is done. Now, now, cuddle. Cuddle with your demons."
Proposition Infinity,Bender," Oh, Amy. I wonder where you are right now!"
Proposition Infinity,Amy, I'm inside the dummy to rescue you.
Proposition Infinity,Bender, That answers that. Wait... Amy? [He begins kissing the demon]
Proposition Infinity,Leela," [Fry and Leela can be heard groaning] Bender, be careful!"
Proposition Infinity,Bender," Fry? Leela? You're in there, too? Blech."
Proposition Infinity,Zoidberg, I guess we should have waited in the ship.
Proposition Infinity,Bender," Listen up, everybody, I love Amy and I'm tired of pussyfootcupping around! I finally found someone I want to spend the rest of her life with. Amy, [He lowers his body and pulls a ring out of his chest cabinet. It has a tag that says exhibit A.] will you marry me?"
Proposition Infinity,Amy, Yes! Yes!
Proposition Infinity,Farnsworth," Oh, I'm just glad I didn't live to see this day! Wait a second, [He checks his pulse and hears only one beat] No!"
Proposition Infinity,Zoidberg," [He is admiring Amy's ring] Such a stone. Is it real? [Amy pulls up Zoidberg's coat and uses the diamond to cut through Zoidberg's skin, revealing his internal organs.] Horray!"
Proposition Infinity,Farnsworth, Horray denied! Need I remind you that robosexual marriage is illegal!
Proposition Infinity,Leela, Not in Space Massachusetts.
Proposition Infinity,Bender," You mean Space-tax-achusetts. No chance, stretch pants! We're gonna fight to legalize it right here!"
Proposition Infinity,Hermes," Yeah, man! You got to legalize it!"
Proposition Infinity,Amy, We're talking about robosexual marriage.
Proposition Infinity,Hermes, We're talking about lots of stuff.
Proposition Infinity,Fry, Cool! Can you turn into a race car?
Proposition Infinity,Hot Dog Stand," Nah, I'm just a pre-op transformer."
Proposition Infinity,Amy," [on stage] Thank you for coming, everyone. We're all having some good, clean fun here."
Proposition Infinity,Hedonism Bot," [In a bondage outfit] Squeaky, squishy clean! [The Hot Dog Stand vomits hot dogs on Hedonism Bot.]"
Proposition Infinity,Amy," But it's time to discuss a pressing issue, the right to marry who, or what, we want! [The crowd cheers]"
Proposition Infinity,Bender," Every other couple has the right to marry, robot and fembot, [Cut to the Donbot and Fanny, man and woman, [Pan to Pauly Shore and Michelle, man and man [Pan to Randy Munchnik, his partner, and their poodle.]"
Proposition Infinity,Randy, Our poodle has two daddies.
Proposition Infinity,Bender," Interracial, [Pan to two aliens who are half-black and half-white], Interplanetary, [Pan to a blob and a woman], even ghost and horse, [a ghost is floating nearby with a horse inside its body] but not robot and human."
Proposition Infinity,Amy, That's why we're introducing this ballot initiative to legalize robosexual marriage.
Proposition Infinity,Bender," If you hate intolerance and begin punched in the face by me, please support Proposition Infinity!"
Proposition Infinity,Bender, Damn it!
Proposition Infinity,,
Proposition Infinity,"[The montage continues while Bender gets hit by URL. The crew holds a sign that reads ""Stand up for equality"" while nearby the Professor, Hattie and two others have a sign that reads, ""Fall down and be unable to get up for traditional marriage"".]",
Proposition Infinity,,
Proposition Infinity,[Scene,  √2 News broadcast.]
Proposition Infinity,,
Proposition Infinity,<poem>Linda," [on TV] As election day nears, prop infinity seems doomed to certain defeat."
Proposition Infinity,Morbo, [on TV] Doooooooomed!
Proposition Infinity,Linda," [on TV] More fair and balanced coverage after a word from our sponsor, No on Infinity."
Proposition Infinity,Actor 1, A storm is gathering.
Proposition Infinity,Actor 2, A storm of robosexual marriage that will rain down on us like fire.
Proposition Infinity,Actor 1, It's probably a firestorm.
Proposition Infinity,Actress," If robosexual marriage becomes legal, imagine the horrible things that will happen to our children, then imagine we said those things, since we couldn't think of any. As a mother, those things worry me."
Proposition Infinity,Man, [Voice over] Vote No on Infinity. Paid for by the Farnsworth Foundation.
Proposition Infinity,Amy, We can't compete against that much stock footage of clouds! We're boned!
Proposition Infinity,Bender," But we still have one hope, my big televised debate! I'm our A in the hole!"
Proposition Infinity,Fry," Professor, who's debating for your side?"
Proposition Infinity,Farnsworth," Oh, that guy, you know, I forget his name."
Proposition Infinity,Farnsworth, [Pointing to a live image of himself on a television screen.] That's him!
Proposition Infinity,George Takei's head," Good evening, I'm George Takei's head and neck, your host for tonight's debate. You may applaud. [The crowd does.] We flipped a coin before the debate and Bender stole it, so we'll start with him."
Proposition Infinity,Bender," Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I... Oops. Sorry, force of habit. I support this proposition because I love a goopy, flesh-and-blood woman, and not surprisingly, she loves me. This is a simple matter of justice, which I'm not normally for. So, please, vote yes. After all, our love isn't any different than yours, except it's hotter, 'cause I'm involved."
Proposition Infinity,Takei," I haven't heard such an eloquent speech since Bill Shatner explained why he couldn't pay me back. Rebuttal, Professor?"
Proposition Infinity,Farnsworth," This $4 coffee pot talks about love, but what he describes is perversion."
Proposition Infinity,Bender," You wouldn't know perversion if it put clamps on your testicles! You're just jealous, 'cause you've never known true love."
Proposition Infinity,Farnsworth," Oh, no? Back when I was full of piss and vinegar, and my bed wasn't, I fell in love with the sweetest girl to ever skip through a field of posies. [Flashback to a younger Professor and Eunice skipping through posies.] Her name was Eunice, and we spent our blissful days working in a lab, developing a poison to wipe out that dreadful posy infestation. [Farnsworth handes Eunice some posies and she drips poison on them. They wilt. The Professor and Eunice kiss.] I thought our love would last forever. But then, 43 years later, she left me [Eunice is in bed with a robot.] for a robot! [End flashback] How could she do that to me, her Farnypoo?"
Proposition Infinity,Amy, That's it? You hate robosexual 'cause your girlfriend left you for a robot?
Proposition Infinity,Farnsworth," She didn't just leave me for a robot. She was a robot! [The crowd gasps.] Oh, God! Her name wasn't Eunice, it was Unit! Unit 47. [The same flower scene plays but Eunice is replaced with Unit 47.] My heart was broken, and like a bitter, old picklepuss, I took my anger out on robosexuals everywhere. I'm so ashamed! At the risk of losing this debate, I beg you, support Proposition Infinity. [The crowd cheers]"
Proposition Infinity,Bender, Give me a hug. [He jumps the Professor]
Proposition Infinity,George Takei's head," I, too, am hugging them in spirit. And now, they're hugging me back. Oh, my!"
Proposition Infinity,Linda," [on TV] In a stunning turnout, voters have approved Proposition Infinity. Robosexual marriage is now legal."
Proposition Infinity,Morbo," [on TV] What's next, gay robosexual marriage?"
Proposition Infinity,Amy," We did it, honey! Finally, we can have a legal, monogamous marriage, like everyone else!"
Proposition Infinity,Bender, Woo-hoo! Yeah! ... Monogamous? [Cut to Bender on a beach with two hookerbots]
Proposition Infinity,Radio announcer," And now, a long-distance dedication from a squishy, green bad boy to his pink pork dumpling. [A motorcycle revs outside. Kif is driving and wearing a leather jacket, sunglasses and boots.] At number 12, it's Wailing Fungus with ""Shut Up and Love Me""."

The Duh-Vinci Code,Morbo," [Angrily] Silence, puny audience. And welcome to Who Dares to be a Millionaire? Tremble before Morbo's mighty likability, [Calmly] as I chitchat with out first contestant, Philip J. Fry."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Bender," [In audience.] Give him hell, Morbo!"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Morbo," [Angrily] Prepare for pleasantries. [Calmly] So Fry, what do you do for a living?"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," Me? Um, can I phone a friend?"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Morbo," [Angrily] Chitchat achieved! [Dramatic music plays, lights turn on and the game begins.] Are you ready to play?"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, I didn't come to play. I came to win. Now let's play.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Morbo," For $1, what tool is used to hammer a nail? Is it, A, a hammer? B, A nail? C..."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," B, nail, final answer! [A buzzer sounds and Fry's chair blasts off.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Hermes, Sweet dodo of Lesotho! Don't you ever stop to think before you speak?
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, I never stop to think about it.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leela," Aw, leave Fry alone. His intelligence is just a little differenty."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Bender, [Pointing at Fry] You big dummy!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," Hey, I'm begining to think you guys don't think I'm very smart."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," You can barely remember your own name, Einstein."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, Einstein is a hard name to remember. [The Professor pokes him in the eye with the Fing-Longer]. Ow!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Amy," Smeesh, Professor. Don't have a schmaneurysm. Fry's your distant relative."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth, Not distant enough! I'll be a monkey's uncle if I'm this monkey's nephew!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, [He sniffles] But you're my only family. Who will hug me if I achieve something?
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," Oh, perhaps I've been too harsh. Come, lad, take my hand and I'll explain why I find you so repugnant."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," All my life I've been inspired by great minds. Euclid, Copernicus, Braino. And my personal role model, Leonardo da Vinci. [He gestures to a bust of each.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, What turned them to stone?
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," [He slaps his forehead and sighs] da Vinci was history's greatest artist and inventor. [He pulls up the head of da Vinci, revealing a button. He presses it. A shelf rises into the ceiling, revealing a lit cabinet with various sketches and models on shelves.] Voilà! He invented flying machines, war engines, submarines."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, [He takes a beard from the cabinet] Uh-oh! Nibbler died in the wall.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," That's not Nibbler. That's my most precious possession. Leonardo's beard! I paid a fortune for it at an auction of historic body parts. I suppose if I have an Achilles' heel, it's because I bought it at that same auction. [He shows Fry a glass foot with a heel bone in it.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, [Wearing the beard] Indeed so. Most indeededly.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," Careful with that, you fool! [Fry sneezes, causing the beard to separate into individual hairs] No! No! But possibly yes. [A scroll is behind Fry's mouth]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," What is it, Professor?"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," [He unravels and unfolds the scroll] Oh, my! It's da Vinci's fabled lost invention. Even the scholars who wrote of this device had no idea what it was for. And now, at least, neither do I!"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, Maybe we can figure it out.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth, We? [He cackles insanely]
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," Well, I may not have brain smarts, but at least I have street smarts. [He is run over by a hoverbus.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, I was in the hospital two weeks. No one visited me.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," Quiet, you! I'm trying to deduce the function of da Vinci's lost invention."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, Not even a card.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsowrth," He might have hidden a clue in one of his other works. Ergo, I sent Bender out for a copy of the Last Supper."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Bender," I'm back! Everyone at Kinko's was an idiot, so I just brought the original. [He drags in a stone slab with the Last Supper on it.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Zoidberg, Jesus Christ! ...and his Twelve Apostles!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Amy, [She points to something on the painting.] That's odd. This hand here doesn't belong to anybody. And it's pointing a knife at James the Lesser!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Bender, That's the great thing about that hand.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Hermes," [He points to a different part of the painting.] And what about these funky table legs? It's like their part of some other, funkier painting."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Zoidberg, Maybe da Vinci painted over something else. It's called a pentimento.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," That's true, Dr. Zoidberg. How did you know that?"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Zoidberg, My doctorate is in Art History.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," Let's see what's under the Last Supper. [He pressed a remote and a laser-like device descends from the ceiling. It fires at Hermes, allowing us to see through him.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Hermes," Wait a second, I'm not big-boned, I'm just fat."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth, [He nudges the machine.] My God! Look! [The crew gasps.]
The Duh-Vinci Code,Amy, My God! I'm looking!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leela, My God! Saint James was a robot!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Zoidberg, My God! da Vinci left his legs unpainted as a clue.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth, My God! This is the greatest mystery of all time. We must fly to Rome and exhume the body of Saint James.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Hermes, Didn't we used to be a delivery company?
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth, To the ship!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," Psst. Leela, wanna join the Mile-Deep Club?"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leela," Sure, why not?"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnswoth, No time! I've found a clue that could unlock all the secrets of history. [Fry groans. They walk to a tomb.] Look at these Roman numerals.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, Roman numerals? I've got it! We're in Rome.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," [He hits Fry with a torch.] Don't be stupid. It's a long lost mathematical code. I'll need to consult these ancient writings. [He pulls out a book and blows the dust off it. It is The da Vinci Code.] Some preposterous hog-wash about the Fibonacci Sequence. Aha! The markings indicate how many paces we need to take. One ... Okay, we're there. [In front of them is a tomb that reads ""JAMES"". ]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Bender," Brothers and sisters, let us pry. [He pulls a crowbar out of his chest cabinet and opens the tomb. A robot is in there]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," It's true, Saint James really was a robot."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Bender, I bet he's up in Robot Heaven right now. So he won't miss his eyes. [He attempts to remove them with a screwdriver.]
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, My God! Robot Saint James is a zombie.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Animatronio," Nay, I am not Saint James."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Bender," Enough of your lies, Saint James. We saw you in the Last Supper."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Animatronio," The great man Leonardo built me as an artist's model. When I took repose in this coffin, I carefully tossed the real Saint  James in yonder heap. [A skeleton is nearby.] I'm sure you have many questions. Come, there is a chamber where I used to speak with Pope John the Patient."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Animatronio," [He sighs. The Pope's skeleton is still seated in a chair, wearing his hat.] I told him I'd be back in five minutes. Ah well, he'll make a nice heap. [He dumps the body and sits in the chair himself.] I am Animatronio, guardian of da Vinci's great secret. He left my legs visible in the painting as a clue, then dispatched me hither to wait for his shadow society of intellectuals."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," Hi, Animatronio."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," You personally knew da Vinci? [He gives a fan-girlish squeal.] Was he nice? How did his hair smell? And on a personal note, what is the function of this device? [He shows the plans.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Animatronio, Halt! You do not know the function of the Macchina Magnifica? Then thou art not members of the Shadow Society. [He takes the plans.]
The Duh-Vinci Code,Bender, The what now?
The Duh-Vinci Code,Animatronio," Not one more word shall I breathe. Not even about the great fountain where thou mayest find the... Wait. Thou didst not know about the fountain, didst thou? Curses, I must be punished. [He begins flaying himself.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnswoth," Quick, we must find out what he knows before he flays himself to death!"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leela, Where is the great fountain?
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, What makes it so great?
The Duh-Vinci Code,Bender, Why does a robot need a codpiece?
The Duh-Vinci Code,Animatronio," Fie, thou fen-suckled bum-bailey! Thou wilst never pry information from these mechanical lips!"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leela," Just tell us, already!"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Animatronio," Okay, the fountain thou seekest is... [He groans and falls over.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," And so dies our hope of solving this mystery. Come on gang, let's go home. Wait! Let's not give up so easily. Animatronio mentioned a fountain. [He looks at a statue.] That's a statue of Neptune, god of water. The number of points on him trident is three, or trey. The ""u"" in his name is written like ""v"". Trey, ""v"". Trevi! It's the Trevi Fountain. There can be no question!"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leela," But, Professor..."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth, There can be no question!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," Wow, it hasn't changed in a thousand years. [Tentacles reach out of the water and grab a man posing for a picture.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," Okay, everyone, into the fountain."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Bender," What are you, senile? I'm not jumping in there."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," Hey, look. Coins."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Bender," [He jumps into the fountain. Before he can grab the change, a Giant Squid comes out of a cave. The squid and Bender struggle then both pull out pistols. Gunshots can be heard from the surface. The dead Squid floats up.] I got 48 cents. There's one more nickel, and it's a big one! [He floats down and pulls at the nickel. It is actually a plug keeping water in the fountain. The water starts to drain, taking Bender with it.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," Quickly, into the sewer hole. [He and Fry jump in.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leela, Why? [She is pulled under by the Professor. A hooded figure selling Gelato notices and follows them.]
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, [Looking through a window.] What's this dump? [They are surrounded by Roman Architecture.]
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth, My god! It's the Pantheon!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leela," This place is 3,000 years old. What could possibly be left to discover?"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," Maybe something about ourselves, Leela. Wait! What's under that blanket? [Fry removes it to reveal a statue of the Vitruvian Man.] My God! da Vinci's Vitruvian Man!"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, It's truly a masterpiece. Note how the perspective lines draw the eye right to his dong.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," [The hooded figure appears and shoots a dart at the Professor.] Say, what's this? [He moves in time for the dart to miss him and hit Bender's eye.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Bender, Anyone hear something?
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," It's a coin slot. Bender, insert that giant nickel."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Bender, Sure. [He has the nickel on a piece of string. He inserts it and it takes his entire arm with it.] Ow!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnswoth," Hush, Bender. [The statue realigns itself.] What's your game, Vitruvian Man? [The statue turns on it side and rolls along the floor. The floor divides behind the statue. Leela scrambles to get to the Professor. A workshop is revealed under the floor.] I withdraw the question, Vitruvian Man."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth, Da Vinci's lost workshop!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," At the risk of sounding stupid, do these things actually work?"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," Of course not, stupid! [He gestures to a flying machine] I mean, that flying machine is as aerodynamic as a sofa. How could it possibly get off the ground?"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Animatronio, In a way that shalt never discover. [Everyone but Fry gasps].
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," Hi, Animatronio."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Animatronio," I feign death and stalk thee, that I might preserve the greatest of Leonardo's secrets! [He throws a mace and it lands on Bender's empty arm socket. Bender hits him with the handle of the mace.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Bender," All right, buddy, we want secrets! And they better be ancient!"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Animatronio, Porco metallico! Never shall I reveal how these wonderous machines fit together!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth, They fit together?
The Duh-Vinci Code,Animatronio, I said no such thing. And then I died! [He groans and collapses. He opens his eye then shuts it again.]
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," [Sitting in the chair of the flying machine] You're right, Professor. This thing doesn't fly."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," Don't sit in there, you idiot! That's dangerous! [He sits on a catapult and gets shot into a series of tubes that directs him into the co-pilot's seat.] Wha? [The machine is lifted up and glass is placed on top of their heads, creating a sealed cockpit. Several more machines go off and the ship is loaded into a cannon.] No wonder this contraction isn't aerodynamic! It's not an aircraft, it's a spacecraft! [The cannon is pointed to a gap in the ceiling.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Animatronio," Basta! As I live, thou shan't discover the great secret! [He works a ballista until it is pointed at the spacecraft. Bender and Leela tackle him. The ballista falls and fires at a lever. The spacecraft is shot into the air.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," Bye, Animatronio!"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth, My God! Why would Leonardo's machine's brought us here?
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, I don't know. Let's ask this guy. [A man is standing in front of them.]
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo da Vinci, I am Leonardo. [They gasp.] Welcome to Planet Vinci.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth, My God!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, That's what I was gonna say!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth, Leonardo! You're alive? Here?
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo," [He sighs.] You have learned my great secret. I was but a visitor to Earth. In truth, I am what you call a space alien."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth, Oh!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," It's an honor to meet you, Leonardo. And may I say you were great in Titanic. The Beach? Neh."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," That's Leonardo DiCaprio, you blockhead! [He tries to punch Fry in the stomach. Bones are heard cracking.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, Looks like eating rocks wasn't as dumb as you said.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, So what do people do for fun here?
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo, Do you enjoy partying all night with plenty of ale and lusty women?
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, I sure do!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo, Not us. We spend our leisure time in the mathematics museum. Planet Vinci is basically a single colossal university.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, How your football team?
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo, Learned.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth, Ooh! I'm going to check out that math lecture. [A professor is teaching students nearby.] All this knowledge is giving me a raging brainer! [He runs off.]
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo," Would you like to hear the lecture, too, Fry?"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, No. It would just go in one ear and out some other hole.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo," Come, sit down."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," Now that I can do. [He tries to sit in mid-air but fails.] I have a terrible secret to confess, Mr. DiCaprio. I'm not very smart."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo, I appreciate your candor.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, I don't even know what language you're speaking.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo," I, too, have a confession. You see, here on Planet Vinci, I am the stupidest person."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, What? Who possibly think you're stupid? [Two people come near the bench.]
The Duh-Vinci Code,Biff," Duh, I'm Leonardo. I don't know the mass of the Higgs boson."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Woman," Duh, I have to draw in pencil, because I don't know how to use Rendering software."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo, Stupid Biff. Thinks he's so smart.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," He looks stronger than you, too."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo, I went to Earth because I could no longer stand the ridicule. But being surrounded by even stupider people was equally infuriating.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, I can see myself in your shiny button.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo," Inventing is what makes me happy. Or did, until I misplaced the plans for my masterpiece."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, You mean these? [He holds out the plans.]
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo," The Macchina Magnifica? Infinity joy! Fry, my friend, you have given my life a meaning again!"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," That calculus lecture was harder than I expected. We had to answer every question in the form of an opera. I have a lot of homework for tomorrow, if I don't want to be [He puts on a Viking opera helmet.] Embarrassed!"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," [Fry finishes his ""musical piece"" and the crowd starts booing.] Thank you. Thank you. And if you like that, you'll love our main event. Ladies and gentlemen, Leonardo DiCaprio! [The crowd cheers.] I mean da Vinci! [The crowd starts booing again.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo," For centuries, you've all ridiculed me. Especially you, Biff."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Biff, Nice hat! [The crowd hoots.]
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo," But, at long last, this invention will show you. It will show you all. Behold, my unstoppable doomsday machine!"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry, And I helped! Wait. You told me it was an unstoppable ice cream machine.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo, Ice cream is just a by-product of the machine. It's primary purpose is to exterminate everyone who ever made me feel inferior!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Biff," Oh, I'm so scared!"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Girl," Bring it on, dum-dum. [The crowd laughs.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo, Oh yeah? Let's see how hard you are laughing when my doomsday machine chops off your face! [He powers up the machine.]
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," Leonardo, stop! [The crowd gasps.] I want in on this!"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," Are you crazy, Professor?"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," I hate these nerds. Just because I'm stupider than them, they think they're smarter than me. Kill them all, starting with the math teacher!"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth, [Taking the plans from Fry.] I knew this final invention would be a humdinger!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo," Yes, we three idiots will finally have our revenge."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," I don't think so! You two make me ashamed to call myself an idiot. [He jumps on the machine.] There's always going to someone smarter than you, so the only way to be happy is to make the most of what you've got."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo, But you've got nothing.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry,"Oh no? I've got one single nail and another nail to nail it in with. And I'm gonna stop this infernal ice cream machine once and for all! [He tries to nail in a nail but it hits him in the eye. He stumbles and gets caught in the gears.  Fry is being sent through the gears of the machine, finally jamming it. The machine stops and falls over. Leonardo and the Professor run out of the way. The audience laughs.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Biff, Some doomsday machine! It barely killed anyone!
The Duh-Vinci Code,Leonardo," Oh, yeah? Well, take this! [He kicks the machine, causing a lever to pop out. He pulls it and a giant gear crushes him.]"
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," Oh, my."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Girl, Poor Leonardo da Vinci. He sure was stupid.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," Fry, I admire what you did today, and I'm deeply sorry for insulting your intellect. Your tiny, tiny intellect. Oops, there I go again, you dope. I mean, dummy."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," It's okay. I may not be clever, but I have a good heart. That's what my mom used to say."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth, She was a wise woman.
The Duh-Vinci Code,Fry," Also, that I'm not much to look at."
The Duh-Vinci Code,Farnsworth," A wise woman, indeed."
The Duh-Vinci Code,,
Lethal Inspection,Farnsworth, [Groans] I fear I may not survive this war reenactment. I can't believe we’re only twelve feet from the parking lot.
Lethal Inspection,Fry," [standing in mud, surrounded by flies] This is every bit as fun as the real Civil War."
Lethal Inspection,Leela," Not the Civil War private. We’re reinacting the Sith-il War. [She points to a plaque that says ""Sith Invasion of 2865 Historic Site""]"
Lethal Inspection,Fry, Sith? What the Hoth?
Lethal Inspection,Bender, Enemy invaders! Up in yonder sky!
Lethal Inspection,Darth Stroyer, I am Darth Stroyer.
Lethal Inspection,Fry, Darth Stroyer? That’s the stupidest name I’ve ever heard.
Lethal Inspection,Leela, Let’s hear the rest.
Lethal Inspection,Darth Trocious, Darth Trocious.
Lethal Inspection,Darth Sploder, Darth Sploder.
Lethal Inspection,Darth Urderer, Darth Urderer.
Lethal Inspection,Darth Ithead, Darth Ithead. [His lightsaber malfunctions and he has to turn it back on]
Lethal Inspection,Leela, Company! Attack!
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, Don’t fire until you see the greens of their eyes! It saves on bullets.
Lethal Inspection,Darth Stroyer, I shall rip out your heart and show it to you! [touches Scruffy with a lightsaber] It is done.
Lethal Inspection,Scruffy, The candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long. [He lays on the ground and acts dead.] Mhrm.
Lethal Inspection,Darth Sploder, You're dead!
Lethal Inspection,Farnsworth," No, I'm just very old. [He makes choking noises and falls down]"
Lethal Inspection,Darth Sploder, [He taps the Professor with his foot and gets no response.] Woah! That's good acting!
Lethal Inspection,Fry," It's payback time, Sploder! [Fry's gun fires a beam that tags Sploder then falls flat. Fry presses a button on his gun and the beam retracts.]"
Lethal Inspection,Darth Sploder, Tell my mother... to pick me up outside Quiznos.
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," [Wheeling his desk up] That's three dead. Uh-oh. Let's pick up the pace, people. At this point in the actual war, the death toll was ninety-eight million. [He gestures towards a large set of graves nearby]"
Lethal Inspection,Bender, [Chuckles] You humans and your fragile organs. One little stab to the goo and [He blows a raspberry]
Lethal Inspection,Darth Trocious," [He lands on Bender and tags with his lightsaber.] You're dead, Earth man!"
Lethal Inspection,Bender," [Dramatically] Oh, cruel fate, I'm dead. They're putting me in my Sunday suit and shoving me in a wooden box. [He falls to the ground] Now they're loading me into cold, cold ground. Hello! Here come the worms! [He starts laughing]"
Lethal Inspection,Fry," If you were really dead, you wouldn't be laughing so hard."
Lethal Inspection,Bender," Yeah, yeah. Death's a big deal to you flesh bags. But in case you didn't notice, I'm a robot."
Lethal Inspection,Fry," So? What if something heavy fell on you, like a church? You could still die."
Lethal Inspection,Bender," Nuh-uh! My wireless back-up unit saves a copy of me every day. So, if my body gets killed, big whoop, I just download into another body. I'm immortal, baby!"
Lethal Inspection,Amy, What? Then how come you always scream so much when you're in danger?
Lethal Inspection,Bender, I never said I wasn't a drama queen.
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, And the winner of the war is... let me just cross check my tabulation here. Factor in the corsages for the widows.
Lethal Inspection,Bender," Hurry up, you number-crunching crumb-nuncher! Everybody but me is dying of old age!"
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," Okay. The winners, at a net cost of only $12 per life cut tragically short, our Sith Overlords."
Lethal Inspection,Darth Sploder, Hot diggity! I mean... [Breathes like Darth Vader in his best basso profundo voice.] Supreme diggity.
Lethal Inspection,Fry," It may have been a fake war, but my scuffed knee is all too real."
Lethal Inspection,Farnsworth," I have pain in joints I had removed a century ago. Bender, bring me my soft chair with the wheels on it."
Lethal Inspection,Bender, Your wheelchair?
Lethal Inspection,Farnsworth, I don't need a wheelchair! The one with the wheels!
Lethal Inspection,Bender, Poor flimsy humans. Don't you wish you were flawless like me? A towering inferno of physical perfection?
Lethal Inspection,Leela," I hate to pop your blimp-like ego, but you're not perfect."
Lethal Inspection,Bender, Am so!
Lethal Inspection,Leela, Are not!
Lethal Inspection,Bender, Is too!
Lethal Inspection,Leela, Says who?
Lethal Inspection,Bender," Says the only human whose opinion I even remotely respect. [He takes a scrap of paper out of his chest cabinet and kisses it] Inspector 5, the best inspector a kid could want. The day I was built, he looked me over, probably with tears of pride in his eyes, and proclaimed to all the world, by means of this scrap of paper, that I was perfect and infallible in every way!"
Lethal Inspection,Farnsworth," Hey, Mr. Perfect? You wet the chair. [He points to the oil stain on the wheelchair]"
Lethal Inspection,Bender, Huh? Wasn't me. Must be some of that urine your all so proud of.
Lethal Inspection,Fry," [He tastes some of the puddle with his finger] That's not urine, it's oil."
Lethal Inspection,Bender, Impossible! I'm triple sealed to prevent any chance of ... [He looks behind him and shrieks. He is leaking oil.]
Lethal Inspection,Zoidberg," You call that an ink defense? [His coat tears off and he sprays ink everywhere and scuttles off] Goodbye, friends!"
Lethal Inspection,Bender," What could have caused the leak? Excessive heat, on the count that I'm so hot?"
Lethal Inspection,Farnsworth," Alas, no. Oh, Bender, I'm afraid it's a symptom of a fatal defect."
Lethal Inspection,Bender," Yeah, fatal schmatal. If I die I can just download my backup copy into a new, equally fabulous, body."
Lethal Inspection,Farnsworth, That's just it! You can't. You were built without a backup unit.
Lethal Inspection,Bender," [He sits up, shocked] There's no backup copy of me?"
Lethal Inspection,Farnsworth," That's what I just said, you mortal coil."
Lethal Inspection,Bender," So, if I die..."
Lethal Inspection,Farnsworth, You die. Or as you put it [He blows a raspberry]
Lethal Inspection,Bender," [Nervous] Um, excuse me for a moment. [He unscrews his head and puts it into his chest cabinet] [muffled] No!"
Lethal Inspection,Bender, I can't believe it! I'm gonna die.
Lethal Inspection,Fry," How much time does he have left, Professor?"
Lethal Inspection,Farnsworth, Between a minute and a billion years.
Lethal Inspection,Fry," [He puts his hand on Bender's shoulder] Well, at least you can plan accordingly."
Lethal Inspection,Bender, Dying sucks butt! How do you living beings cope with mortality?
Lethal Inspection,Leela, Violent outbursts.
Lethal Inspection,Amy, General sluttiness.
Lethal Inspection,Fry," Thanks to denial, I'm immortal."
Lethal Inspection,Bender," Damn it, I'm supposed to be perfect. Inspector 5 gave me his blessing! [He pulls out his scrap of paper and looks at it] How could he bring me into this world knowing I gonna die?"
Lethal Inspection,Zoidberg," So you wish you were never born, maybe?"
Lethal Inspection,Bender," Yes, anything less than immortality is a complete waste of time!"
Lethal Inspection,Zoidberg, Then suicide it is. Step into my office. I'll give you a nice Kervorking.
Lethal Inspection,Bender, Not until I hunt down Inspector 5 and beat an explanation out of him!
Lethal Inspection,Leela," I'm all for a good beating, but you'll never find him. Product inspectors are bureaucrats, faceless bean counters who blend into the woodwork."
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, [While his shirt blends into the wall] I beg to differ!
Lethal Inspection,Bender, Stinking bureaucrats! I hate 'em.
Lethal Inspection,Leela," Then again, you might be able to find Inspector 5 with the help of another seasoned bureaucrat."
Lethal Inspection,Bender," Hermes, old pal!"
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," Old pal? 8.5 seconds ago, you said you hated me."
Lethal Inspection,Bender, Time heals all wounds.
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," You know what? I will help you, but only to prove I'm not just a paper-pushing file-jockey."
Lethal Inspection,Amy, Will you be taking your portable filing cabinet?
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, None of your beeswax!
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," I'll only be away an hour, but I'm counting on you to do the all-critical filing in my absence. Shall we review alphabetical order. [He starts singing] A, B, C, D..."
Lethal Inspection,Leela, [Shoving Hermes outside] Get out of my office!
Lethal Inspection,Old man, Yes. I'd like to request a death certificate. [He dies.]
Lethal Inspection,Woman, Sorry. That's Building C.
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, The Central Bureaucracy maintains records on all bureaucrats. We should be able to look up Inspector 5.
Lethal Inspection,Man, [He scans Hermes' grade 36 badge then stamps three forms three times each.] Application for ingress approved. [He hands over a form] And the other potential entrant?
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," Uh, he's my pencil sharpener."
Lethal Inspection,Bender, You betcha! [He takes the man's pencil and sharpens it in his ass then hands it back]
Lethal Inspection,Man, [While staring at the pencil] Proceed. [He picks up the pencil with tongs and drops it in a fire.]
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, I maintain a cubicle here for weekend getaways.
Lethal Inspection,Bender," Wow! Until now, I thought giant cubes were exciting."
Lethal Inspection,Bender, I did like the part where they screamed.
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, [Wheeling an escalator to his cubicle.] This is mine. Right next to the center square.
Lethal Inspection,Center Square Guy," Sorry, Hermes. I drank all your white-out. [He laughs]"
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," Once I log in, I can access Inspector 5's profile."
Lethal Inspection,Bender, [He sits in front of the computer and has his eye scanned. A buzzer sounds.] Damn it! It won't go on.
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, That's because you're not me. [He sits in front of the computer and begins working]
Lethal Inspection,Bender, Hooray! It won't go on!
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, The bureaucra-scan won't let anyone but the assigned bureaucrat log in. [He is scanned and his profile appears onscreen.]
Lethal Inspection,Computer," Identity confirmed. Also, you have a rectangular mass in your colon."
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, That's a calculator. I ate it to gain its power.
Lethal Inspection,Bender, You locate Inspector 5 while I slip into my ass-kicking feet. [He pulls a pair of foot-cups with spikes on them out of his chest cabinet and screws them on.]
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, [He gasps] Sweet File-not-found of Puget Sound! His record's been blanked!
Lethal Inspection,Bender," Aw, man! How am I going to find some anonymous guy I don't know anything about?"
Lethal Inspection,Center Square Guy," I recommend the men's room of the TWA terminal. [He laughs and a red ""X"" appears on his desk]"
Lethal Inspection,Leela," Okay. Just filing alphabetically. [She unscrews the container] A, B, C, D... [The message is in AL1.] Oh, this requires a little extra thought. [She looks around then hides the message behind a potted plant] I'm a natural."
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," The information we need will be here, in the physical files."
Lethal Inspection,Bender," [Rolling up his ""sleeves""] Those bastards won't know what leafed through them. [Hermes opens the door and they run inside, looking around. There is only one filing cabinet with three drawers] It's on!"
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," [He opens the drawer and it knocks Bender down. Hermes looks through the files.] No! This is impossible! Quit blacking out and look at this. Inspectors 1, 2, 3, 4... 6. There's no trace of Inspector 5!"
Lethal Inspection,Bender, But 5's the one we want. Maybe if I kicked the asses of Inspector 2 plus Inspector 3...
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," Addition never solve anything, man. Let's cut our losses and go home."
Lethal Inspection,Bender," So I'm doomed to die? And I'll never even get to punch whoever's responsible? Oh, what's the point. [He walks into a suicide booth]"
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," Bender, no! Suicide isn't necessarily the answer!"
Lethal Inspection,Bender," It's not a suicide booth, you lard-ass. It's a phone booth. [He closes the door]"
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," They have phones in booths now? Finally, I don't have to lug this cellphone around. [He throws his cellphone into a trash bin]"
Lethal Inspection,[Bender puts a coin on a string in the slot then pulls it out again. He dials a number.],
Lethal Inspection,Mom, Who the hell is this? How did you get this number?
Lethal Inspection,Bender, Is this the robot company? Cause I have a complaint about a defective robot. His name is me!
Lethal Inspection,Mom," A defective robot, you say? [A monitor shows Bender in the phone booth with Hermes nearby.] Stay right there, dearie. [Cross-hairs appear over the phone booth] I'll have tech support take care of you. [She presses a button]"
Lethal Inspection,Bender," [He exits the phone booth.] Well, things are starting to look up."
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, Look up! [They dive out of the way of a missile that explodes nearby.] Who did you call? Dial-a-bomb?
Lethal Inspection,Bender," No, I just told the robot company I was defective."
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, You dumb cocktail shaker! Mom won't allow a defective product to tarnish her good name! She'll kill you.
Lethal Inspection,Bender," Big whoop. I'll just download into a new... Oh, right. If I die, I die. Speaking of which– [Machine guns start shooting at them] You're right. You're right. You're right. [They run away]"
Lethal Inspection,Mom, [Watching the Killbots on a monitor] That's what you get for calling tech support.
Lethal Inspection,Bender, I can't run anymore. I'll have to skip. [They skip off]
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, Just a few more feet. We have to get to that pile of dead bears by 7 38.
Lethal Inspection,Bender, A pile of dead bears can only mean one thing. But what?
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, It's the 7 38! Jump! [They both jump into a train car. The Killbots come up on the track next to it.]
Lethal Inspection,Bender," Aw, shoot!"
Lethal Inspection,Killbot," Someone said ""shoot!"" [They shoot and destroy the Killbot in the middle.]"
Lethal Inspection,Bender," Well, we're boned!"
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," No, we're not! We just go to limbo!"
Lethal Inspection,Bender," But I'm not design to bend that low, not without limbo music. [Bullets hit him creating a rhythm.] That'll do it. Ow! Ow! Ow!"
Lethal Inspection,Killbot 1, We're gonna get fired.
Lethal Inspection,Killbot 2," Someone said ""fire!"" [He shoots Killbot 1, then is killed by the tunnel.]"
Lethal Inspection,Bender, [His legs have been broken] We did it!
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, Twelve straight hours of limbo. I haven't done that since my honeymoon.
Lethal Inspection,Bender, Hermes! Hermes! Remember that flock of bats?
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, I sure do.
Lethal Inspection,Bender, That was fun.
Lethal Inspection,Bender, Where are we?
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, I have no idea.
Lethal Inspection,Bender, Hey. We're just a stone's throw from Tijuana. [He picks up a stone and throws it over the border fence.] See?
Lethal Inspection,Mexican Man, ¡Dios mío! A rock has fallen here in the outskirts of Tijuana.
Lethal Inspection,Bender, Is it within city limits?
Lethal Inspection,Mexican Man," I think, yes."
Lethal Inspection,Bender, Told you!
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," Hey, you wanna celebrate our escape? Maybe grab a shot of tequila and take in a big-league cockfight?"
Lethal Inspection,Bender," Sure. No, wait. I was built in Tijuana. Maybe Inspector 5 still works there. He better do some splaining. Before I mash up some face guacamole."
Lethal Inspection,Bender," [Bender and Hermes walk up to a border checkpoint.] He's Mexican, I'm Mexican. Let me handle this."
Lethal Inspection,Mexican border patrolman," Sus papeles, por favor."
Lethal Inspection,Bender, ¡Sí! [Bender gets hit on the head with a ukulele.] Ouch-o!
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," [He pulls a miniature filing cabinet out of his pocket.] Here are our passports, visas, and Homeland Security permission slips, notarized and starched."
Lethal Inspection,Mexican border patrolman, [He looks them over.] Okay. I also would ¡ave accepted a bribe.
Lethal Inspection,Bender," Nice work, butterball. You know, I was in Italy last week. [He gasps]"
Lethal Inspection,Bender," My birthplace. It's closed! There's not even a shrine to me. With a gift shop, selling piñatas of me!"
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," End of the line, man! Come on, we can still catch a twi-night double cockfight."
Lethal Inspection,Bender, No wait! What's that in the Mexican garbage?
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, Looks like a half-eaten cheese diaper.
Lethal Inspection,Bender," No, next to that. [He pulls out a book and shakes two owls off it] A half-eaten employee directory. [He opens it and gasps] Inspector 5's home address. [387 Avenida Con Pollo] His ass-ias is gracias!"
Lethal Inspection,Bender," [He bursts through the door] Where are you hiding, you coward? Get out here and get murdered like a man!"
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," [He closes the door] Bender, I'm afraid our search is at an end. He's obviously long gone."
Lethal Inspection,Bender," Oh yeah? Well, maybe this is him in a costume. [He picks up an iguana and begins squeezing it] I'm gonna squeeze you out of there like Tijuana toothpaste."
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," [He helps Bender up] Okay, Bender, you're mortal. And okay, Inspector 5 screwed up. But that just makes the time you have left all the more precious. Do you really want to waste the rest of your life in a bitter, homicidal rage?"
Lethal Inspection,Bender," [While punching the wall] No! Yes! I don't know! [He punches the wall a few more times] Why? Why did he do this to me? All I wanted was a little quality control. But he didn't care enough. And now I gonna die. I deserve better! I'm Bender, damn it! I'm Bender! [He starts crying]"
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," There, there, mon. It's gonna be okay. You are Bender, which is something Inspector 5 will never be."
Lethal Inspection,Bender," You know what? You're right. He was just a stupid bureaucrat. A stupid paper-pushing bureaucrat. A stupid I-dotting, chair squashing, [Hermes clears his throat] Oh. No offense, Hermes. You're not like that. I mean, you're exactly like that, but you're okay! In fact, I'm putting you on the do-no-kill list. [Hermes smiles] Come on, fellow mortal. We're in Tijuana. I wanna live a little. [An explosion happens outside, blowing a window in.] Help, I'm gonna die! That's the opposite of what I want!"
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," [He goes to the computer] Quick, run out the back! I'll hack into Inspector 5's terminal and fake your death, so they'll call off the Killbots."
Lethal Inspection,Bender," You know that terminal's unhackable! I'm not leaving you, and that's final! [An explosion rips the roof of the house] Good luck, buddy!"
Lethal Inspection,Computer," Bender, terminated."
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, Bender saved.
Lethal Inspection,Killbot 2," Cease fire. Mom called off the attack, although I don't see how it's her–"
Lethal Inspection,Killbot 3," Someone said ""howitzer!"" [Killbots 1 and 3 start firing on the middle Killbot, eventually blowing themselves up.]"
Lethal Inspection,Bender, Yeah! All right! Yeah! [The house collapses. Bender groans and wipes away a tear. Hermes limbos out from under the wreckage.] He did it! And he's not even looking back at that cool explosion! He's a hero!
Lethal Inspection,Amy," What's happening? The phone's been disconnected, the ship's been repossessed, and Zoidberg's getting overcooked! [Scruffy is cooking Zoidberg on a spit.]"
Lethal Inspection,Bender, [He and Hermes walk in wearing sombreros.] Ah. This place never changes.
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, Leela! What in the name of Jah happened?
Lethal Inspection,Leela, Too much papers! Not enough hiding plants!
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, It's alright. This place just needs a one-hour bureaucratizing.
Lethal Inspection,Leela, [As Hermes shovels the last of the paperwork into a furnace.] You make it look so easy.
Lethal Inspection,Hermes, I've smoked a lot of paperwork in my day.
Lethal Inspection,Fry," Hey, Bender. Did you ever find that inspector guy you were looking for?"
Lethal Inspection,Bender," [Putting his arm around Hermes] Nah, but thanks to this knucklehead, I did find a new outlook on life. It's precious and sacred, and you only get so many millions of years on this Earth. So let's get brick-faced! [Everyone cheers. Everyone but Hermes runs off]"
Lethal Inspection,Hermes," [He looks around then throws a folder into the fire. The front burns away, revealing Inspector 5 to be Hermes.]"
Lethal Inspection,,
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, Don't wake up Fry.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, My roommate's sleeping.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, Wake up already! [Fry wakes up and looks at Bender.] I'm about to get down and funky with this ladybot. And I'd appreciate it if as many people as possible could know about it. [They walk off to Bender's room.] [angry] Now can we get some privacy?
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender," Ah yeah, backing on up."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender," [singing] Hambone! Hambone! Hambone. [talking] Okay, hambone break's over. Back to the bedroom."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, [off-screen; singing] Hambone! Hambone! Hambone.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, Wake up and feel the coffee.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, Oh no! I'm late for work again!
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," Sorry, I'm late."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender," Well, well, well. Look who decided to show up."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth," I've had it with your tardiness, Fry. I expect you to arrive the same time as everyone else."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," Well, wait a second. Leela's not here yet."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Amy, She left a while ago. She said some idiot were taking her to lunch for her birthday.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, Oh no! I'm late.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Elzar," Since you got stood up, I thought this might cheer you up a notch."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Leela, That's not necessary.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Elzar, [singing] What day is today?
The Late Philip J. Fry,It's Leela's birthday,
The Late Philip J. Fry,Leela, Please stop.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Elzar, [singing] What a day for a birthday
The Late Philip J. Fry,Leela, I really would like you to stop singing.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Elzar, [singing] Let's all have some cake. [talking] You want to buy a slice of a birthday cake for 11.95?
The Late Philip J. Fry,Leela," Yes, please."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," Ooh, nice cake. Sorry, I'm late."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Leela," [angry] Where have you—? [calm] Nah, it's fine."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, You're not mad?
The Late Philip J. Fry,Leela," I was. But then I realised it's actually my fault for thinking you might be on time for once. [She cleans her mouth with a napkin.] Anyhow, I ate both our lunches. You ordered the Lobster Pilé. It wasn't cheap."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Elzar, Bam!
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," Please, let me make it up to you. I'll treat you to a fancy birthday dinner tonight at Cavern on the Green."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Leela, Wow. That'll be the nicest place I've ever been stood up.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," Not this time. No matter what happens, I'll swear I be there."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender," Guys, guys! Hedonism bot is finally settling down and marrying a nice house in the suburb. [He is holding an announcement of Hedonism together with his house with the text 'I'm Getting Married!'.] But tonight, he's having the girls gone wildest bachelor party of all time."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, Woohoohoohoo... [He notices Leela is not pleased.] ... cares? I'm having dinner with Leela.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Leela, Just go to your stupid party. We can have dinner on my birthday some other year.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," No. I can throw up on a stripper anytime. Tonight, I wanna not throw up. On you."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Leela, Really?
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender," Your loss. [He turns around. Farnsworth and Cubert are in the laboratory.] Hey, Professor, you're my wingman."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth," Very well. Eh, Cubert, fetch my drinking teeth."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, I just have to sign Leela's birthday card. How do you spell XO?
The Late Philip J. Fry,Amy, Guh. It's a record-your-own-message card. You don't sign it. You leave a nude video greeting.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, Does it have to be nude?
The Late Philip J. Fry,Amy, I guess not. That never occurred to me.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," If I leave now, record a birthday greeting on the way, score some fancy cologne at the newsstand, I'll be exactly on time!"
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, You're not going anywhere.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, But I have a date.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, You were late this morning. So you'll have to stay and test my latest invention. [They walk over to a giant sheet covering something. He reveals a time travelling machine.] Behold! A time travelling machine!
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, Time? I can't go back there.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth," Ah, but this time machine only goes forward in time. That way you can't accidentally change history. Or do something disgusting like sleep with your own grandmother."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, I wouldn't wanna do that again.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, We're going to test it by going forward in time one minute. [He takes out a remote and opens the time machine. The sound of a car being unlock is heard.] Get in.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," Okay, hurry. Let's get it over with. I can record Leela's birthday card while we're in there."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," [to card] Happy birthday, Leela. I'm really sorry I'm gonna be one minute late, 'cause we're testing the professor's dumb time machine."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, Okay. I'll just nudge us forward exactly one minute into the—
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, My card!
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, Did we go too far? What time is it?
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, [dramatically] The year ten thousand!
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, [voice over] Whoopsie.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth," Oh dear. I mean, oh my."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, The year ten thousand? But I promised Leela I'll be on time for dinner.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth," Relax, Fry. Everyone we ever knew died thousands of years ago."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender," Everyone we ever knew? Nah, I never liked those guys."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," [frustrated] No! They did it! They blew it up! [The camera pans to reveal a monkey Statue of Liberty.] And then the apes blew up their society too. How could this happen? [Camera pans to reveal a bird Statue of Liberty.] And then the birds took over and ruined their society. [Camera pans to reveal a cow Statue of Liberty.] And then the cows. And then... [Camera pans to reveal a strange slug-like Statue of Liberty.] ... I don't know, is that a slug, maybe? [screaming] Noooo!"
The Late Philip J. Fry,Waiter," While you await your [He does a quotation mark hand gesture.] friend. Allow me to read from a prepared history of our cavern. [He takes out a brochure titled 'History of Cavern on the Green'.] These unique rock formations were created over millions of years by mineral rich water dripping from pores in the ceiling. Dripping and dripping. [voice slowed down into a dark tone] year on year, [even slower] century after century."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Elzar," [singing] What day is today? [talking] Hey, aren't you the loser who got stood up on my other restaurant?"
The Late Philip J. Fry,Leela, Just shut up and bring me two dinners.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Leela, Has anyone seen Fry's ass? It's late for a date with my boot.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Cubert, Fry's not here. Obviously he went to that pervert party with Bender and the professor.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Leela, Fry went to the party?
The Late Philip J. Fry,Linda, [on television] We interrupt Hypnotoad on Ice to bring you breaking coverage ... [The title card reads 'Sorrow at the soirée'.] ... of the disaster at Hedonism bot's bachelor party.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Morbo," [on television] Linda, what began as innocent fun ended in tragedy tonight when a nuclear powered robot stripper suffered a catastrophic reactor meltdown. There is only one survivor."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Hedonism bot, Everywhere I looked there were piles of bodies. And then the explosion struck.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Zoidberg, The three coworkers I liked... all dead!
The Late Philip J. Fry,Leela," Fry stood me up and died? [angry] I'm so angry. [sad] I mean, I'm so sad. [angry] But I'm still pretty angry. [sad] But also sad. [to Hermes] Can I be both?"
The Late Philip J. Fry,Hermes, It's what he'd want.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Leela, Then that's what I am! Hi-yah!
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender," Man, the future is a total craphole. Whoever lives here is a crapface sack of crap. [He turns around to some natives.] No offence, fellows."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Native #1," Don't sweat it, man."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, I'll never see Leela again.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth," No, without a backwards time machine we're stuck in this craphole."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Native #1," Dude, give it a rest."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth," Hold on! I got it. We can't go back in time, but we can keep going forward until people invent the backwards time machine."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, And then we can go home.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, Hit it.

The Late Philip J. Fry,Old Hermes, Sometimes I can't believe how successful Planet Express became once the professor was killed and you seized control.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Old Leela, There were tough times. But we all pulled together.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Old Zoidberg, I've been crunching the numbers on our transgalactic strategy—
The Late Philip J. Fry,Old Leela, What are you doing here? I laid you off twenty years ago.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Old Zoidberg," Oh, the claws can't flee like they used to."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Old Leela," Success is nice, but I do kinda miss the old days."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Old Cubert," Hey, Leels."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Old Leela," Hi, Cubert."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Male inhabitant," May we help you, strange ones?"
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender," We are travellers from the past, my good runt."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Female inhabitant," I see, since your time, human evolution has diverged."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Male inhabitant, There are we; advanced in intellect and morality.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Female inhabitant," And the Dumblocks; stupid vicious brutes, who live underground."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth," Advanced in intellect, you say? Have you invented a backwards time machine?"
The Late Philip J. Fry,Female inhabitant," No, but if we apply our superior minds, we can perfect such a device within five years."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, See you then!
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, We're back for our time machine.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth," Yuhoo, boys! What's this era in human history like?"
The Late Philip J. Fry,Soldier #1," The... the machines, we built them to make our lives easier, but they rebelled. They won't stop until every human is dead."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, This seems like a nice future. Let's just stay here. We can settle down on that mountain of skulls.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, Hey! That place had a gorgeous view of Blood Lake.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Lady #1," Greetings, time travellers."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, Stupid jerks wouldn't let me stay in the good future.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, How do you know we're time travellers?
The Late Philip J. Fry,Lady #2, We too studied the time travel enigma.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Lady #3, We have perfected a method using negative mass neutrino fields that allow us to travel backwards in time.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, My name's Hubert.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, [joyous] All right! We can go home!
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, [mocking] Nah-nah! We can go...
The Late Philip J. Fry,Lady #1," We can talk about our research tomorrow. Men are very rare in our society. Even very old and stupid males are priced. [Farnsworth and Fry smiles.] Tonight, please be the guests of honour at our fertility banquet."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth," Well, there is certainly no harm in a fertility banquet."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, I can eat. And fertilise.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Lady #1," Very well, let us anoint our guests in oil without using our hands."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender," [interrupting] Oh, so we can stay in the future you like? But not the future I like? Next!"
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, No! I was about to close the deal.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," Bender, they had a backwards time machine."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, The other place had a lot of good things too. Did you even see that mountain of skulls?
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, Why you!
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender," Oh no, you didn't."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," Stop. Somewhere, some time, Leela's waiting for me. We need to keep looking for a backwards time machine."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, Fry is right.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender," Yes, we have to work together. Not have this fight which I was definitely winning."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, The year one billion.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth," I got a feeling this could be exactly the point in time we've been looking for. [This future is entirely covered in a dead desert, covering as far as the eyes can see.] Nope. [Farnsworth takes up a device that scans the area and turns up an X on its screen and buzzes.] In fact, all life is extinct."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, So let's keeping going forward.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth," Oh, it's no use. Earth is dead. This is the end of all things."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, The Cavern on the Green.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," I made it, Leela. Sorry, I'm a billion years late."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Old Leela," You'll get your alimony cheque, Cubert. Now get lost."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Old Cubert," Chill out, I'm just here to see Amy."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Old Amy," Move it, boy-toy. Granny's taking you to Atlantic City."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Old Hermes, I don't know why you ever married that pig-nose punk.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Old Leela," I don't know either. I'm married to the job now. [The faint reveal of the time machine appears behind Leela and the birthday card comes flying out.] I used to think there was someone for me, but— [She gets hit by the card and falls over.] Aw! [She sits up with the card.] How odd, it's one of those old record-your-own-message birthday cards."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," [on card] Happy birthday, Leela. I'm really sorry I'm gonna be one minute late, because we are testing the professor's dumb time machine. But you know, happy birthday and all and... [He leans closer to the card.] ... I love you. [In the background, the time machine goes off. The card vanishes away from Fry.] My card!"
The Late Philip J. Fry,Old Leela, My whole life I've been mad at him. And it wasn't his fault.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Leela," [voice-over] Dear Fry, our time together was short, but it was the best time of my life."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," You know, all in all, I had a good life. What you say the three of us grab a six pack and watch the universe end?"
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth," Hear, hear!"
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, That's basically what I do every day.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, To the end of the universe.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," So long, Earth. Thanks for the air and whatnot."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," Hey, uh, what was the purpose of life anyway?"
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, Who knows? Probably some hogwash about the human spirit.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, Mm-hm.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, Sounds about right.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth," The stars are receding. Oh, the vast emptiness."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender," Yeah, yeah, I can take a hint."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth," Ah, the last proton should be decaying about now."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," Bye, last proton."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, And... [He stands up.] ... here we are; the end of the universe.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," Well, now what? You guys wanna talk?"
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, No thanks.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, Did anyone else see that?
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth," Unbelievable. It's a second big bang. [In front of them, the sun is forming. Fry is covering his eyes.] My God, is it possible?"
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," It must be possible. It's happening. By the way, what's happening?"
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth," It appears, this universe is exactly identical to the old one. If so, we just need to keep going forward in time to the point when we left. [The Earth is forming in front of them. Volcanoes and ashes cover the surface.] The Earth is born! [It begins raining. A rock hits the Earth and the moon appears.] Ladies and gentlemen, the moon."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, Look. The first fish to crawl up on land.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, [off screen] It was coming right at us.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, You saw it.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, I'm gonna grab another beer.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender," Fry, Fry, you're missing the dinosaurs."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, It's okay. They're not going anywhere. [He finally retrieves a beer and stands up.] Where'd they go?
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, Now what's going on there?
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, History.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth," Hang on, I just want to make one stop."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Hitler, Betrachten Sie meinen Schnurrbart.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, Easy. Easy. Taking her in for a landing.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, One year to go. [He moves the switch.] Six months.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," I'm almost there, Leela."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, One month. [He moves the switch.] Two weeks. [He moves the switch.] One hour. [He moves the switch.] Thirty seconds and here we—
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, Stop!
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender," Give me the keys, Magoo."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, We'll have to bring her around again.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth," Just slow it down, I'll shoot Hitler out the window. [He takes out his weapon again and aims out the window and shoots.] Darn! I hit Eleanor Roosevelt by mistake. [He drops the weapon.] Okay. Nearing our era again. [Bender moves the leaver.] Here we go. [Bender moves the leaver.] Careful this time. [Bender moves the leaver.] Careful."
The Late Philip J. Fry,New Farnsworth, We're going to test it by going forward in time one minute. [He opens the time machine with his remote.] Get in.
The Late Philip J. Fry,New Fry," Okay, hurry, let's get it over with."
The Late Philip J. Fry,New Farnsworth," But, err, wha–?"
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, Oh uh.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, This new universe is about ten feet lower than our old one.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Farnsworth, Pow. We took care of the time travel paradox.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, All right!
The Late Philip J. Fry,Bender, Yabba dabba doo.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," Oh uh, I'm late for dinner with Leela."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Waiter, Welcome to Cavern on the Green. May I offer you some meatloaf while you wait?
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," Sorry, I'm late."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Leela," Actually, you're on time."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, Really?
The Late Philip J. Fry,Leela," I have to admit, I was afraid you wouldn't make it."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry, That was the old Fry. He's dead now.
The Late Philip J. Fry,Fry," Happy birthday, Leela. I got you a card, but I guess I kinda lost it."
The Late Philip J. Fry,Leela, That's okay. I don't really like cards. What I'll remember is our time together.
The Late Philip J. Fry,,
That Darn Katz!,Leela," Aw! Nibbler made a bobo for Mamma. I'll pick it up with my super-dupey poopy scoopy. [Nibbler grumbles. A truck can be heard backing up and Leela enters the room, driving a fork-lift.]"
That Darn Katz!,Amy," Core magnetic field, 31 microteslas."
That Darn Katz!,Prof. Farnsworth, Nice.
That Darn Katz!,Amy," Temperature? Woah! The magma P.I. is 10,000 degrees Selleck! [Leela is emptying Nibbler's litter box in the magma. Amy swears in Cantonese.] Leela, I am collecting data. Can't you dump that somewhere else?"
That Darn Katz!,Leela," Not really. It's highly volatile Dark Matter, and some corn."
That Darn Katz!,Amy, But I'm presenting my thesis tomorrow and I've barely had time to prepare.
That Darn Katz!,Farnsworth, Nonsense. You've been my grad student for twelve years. You were ready six years ago.
That Darn Katz!,Amy, What?
That Darn Katz!,Farnsworth," I probably should have told you. Anyway, the important thing is to be relaxed tomorrow."
That Darn Katz!,Amy, Are you sure?
That Darn Katz!,Farnsworth, Yes. Do what you young people do to unwind. Take a joyride in your jalopy. Wear a T-shirt and eat a fish stick. Go!
That Darn Katz!,Kif," Okay, amigos, one teensy drink to help Amy relax. [They drink.]"
That Darn Katz!,Amy, Hmmm. I guess I'm still kinda nervous.
That Darn Katz!,Leela, One more teensy drink to help Amy relax. [They press buttons on their glasses and they refill by themselves. They drink again.]
That Darn Katz!,Fry, Still a little nervous? [Amy burps.]
That Darn Katz!,Bender, She's a nervous wreck! [They refill and drink again.]
That Darn Katz!,Leela," [At the table with Nibbler.] Well, I may not have a man, but at least I've got you, poopsie-doodle. [She pinches his cheek.]"
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler," [He drinks.] Leela, it's time you and I had a talk."
That Darn Katz!,Leela, A talk? You can't break up with me. You're my pet!
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler," As much as I enjoy being the object of your misplaced affections, I am also a highly sophisticated being who longs for intelligent conversation."
That Darn Katz!,Leela," Aw, is shnookums not feeling schtimuwated?"
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler," An understatement, to say the least. It's time you treated me with respect."
That Darn Katz!,Leela," If you want to be treated like a fellow crew member, fine, but no more purse rides, and no more dressing you up in your cute little sailor suit."
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler," I keep telling you, that's my real naval uniform."
That Darn Katz!,Kif, Your place or mine?
That Darn Katz!,Amy," Both, but first, this place. [She drags him to the floor. Kif laughing nervously the entire time.]"
That Darn Katz!,Hedonism Bot, [Seeing the two of them.] Ooh! Room for one more? [He laughs saucily.]
That Darn Katz!,Amy, I thought I set you for 7 15!
That Darn Katz!,Alarm Clock," Sorry, I hooked up with Bender last night. Dude was all over my snooze button."
That Darn Katz!,Amy," But my doctoral exam is in ten minutes! On Mars! [She runs out of bed but steps in something.] Eww! Kif, did you yack on the floor?"
That Darn Katz!,Kif," [He is the puddle Amy walked in.] Yes, I did."
That Darn Katz!,Morris Katz," Where's your candidate, Farnsworth? I have a long list of students to humiliate today. [A door opens and Kif, Leela, Bender, Fry and Amy walk in.] You're late, Miss Wong."
That Darn Katz!,Amy," Oh, God, this is like one of those nightmares. [She is in only her bra and underpants. She screams.]"
That Darn Katz!,Farnsworth," Here, take my lab coat. [He offers it to her. He only has suspenders and his underpants underneath it.]"
That Darn Katz!,Katz, Allow me to introduce your examining committee in descending  order of grumpiness. Professor Ogden Wernstrom.
That Darn Katz!,Farsnworth, Wernstrom!
That Darn Katz!,Katz," Downtown Professor of Applied Physics, Ethan 'Bubblegum' Tate."
That Darn Katz!,Tate, I see by your curriculum vitæ that you're a Sagittarius.
That Darn Katz!,Katz, And Professor Fisherprice Shpeekenshpell.
That Darn Katz!,Shpeekenshpell, The cow says... Moo.
That Darn Katz!,Farnsworth," [Whispering to Bubblegum.] He proved that 50 years ago, and he's been coasting on it ever since."
That Darn Katz!,Katz," I am the esteemed Professor Morris Katz, and you are wasting my time. Proceed."
That Darn Katz!,Amy," Imagine, if you will..."
That Darn Katz!,Katz," Oh, God!"
That Darn Katz!,Amy," A gigantic spherical generator, one that could provide unlimited energy, because it's essentially in Perpetual Motion."
That Darn Katz!,Wermstrom," [He and Katz scoff, loudly] Young lady, have you been drinking?"
That Darn Katz!,Amy," Well, yes, but that's not revelant. I'm talking about Earth. Earth's the generator. [Shpeekenshpell lands on a sheep and makes a bleating noise.] Suppose this basketball is the whole world."
That Darn Katz!,Tate," [He is spinning a basketball on his finger.] To many young men in the inner city, it is."
That Darn Katz!,Amy," As it spins, it's producing an enormous magnetic field. If we could use that field to generate electric current, we could actually harness the Earth's rotational ener... Ener... [She sneezes.]"
That Darn Katz!,Farnsworth," Yes, tapping the Earth's ener-kerchoo. Go on."
That Darn Katz!,Amy," Sorry, I'm super-allergic to cats. Professor Katz, would you mind."
That Darn Katz!,Katz," Miss Wong, I mind everything."
That Darn Katz!,Amy," [Holding a model.] You just need to polarize the Earth's core with a huge static charge, [The cat starts toying with the model.] by ratcheting Superconducting wire down into... [She sneezes.] Sorry."
That Darn Katz!,Katz, Enough. The committee members will now vote yea or nay. Nay.
That Darn Katz!,Wernstrom, Nay.
That Darn Katz!,Tate, Hell nay.
That Darn Katz!,Shpeekenshpell," [He spins to a Horse.] The horse says, doctorate denied."
That Darn Katz!,Fry," It's okay, Amy. I don't have a fancy degree either, but today I'm a prominent boy in the package delivery field. [After they leave the hangar, Katz's cat leaves the ship.]"
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler," Now that I'm a full and equal member of the crew, I pledge my loyalty, my perspicacity, and, dare I say it, my friendship."
That Darn Katz!,Hermes," Leela, muzzle that skunk! We can't stop a meeting for some cute, fuzzy, little... [He notices Katz's cat.] Hey, look, a kitty cat."
That Darn Katz!,Amy, [The cat rubs against Amy. Static discharges.] You again? [She sneezes.] Get away you mangy ball of Histamines.
That Darn Katz!,Hermes," [He picks the cat up.] You leave kitty cat alone! [The crew, except for Amy and Nibbler gather around, cooing at the cat.]"
That Darn Katz!,Farnsworth," People, please, I'm trying to run a business, so I get to hold kitty. [The crew keeps cooing.]"
That Darn Katz!,Fry, Over here. I wanna hold him.
That Darn Katz!,Bender, Aw! Its anus looks like an asterisk.
That Darn Katz!,Leela," Captain Fuzzytoes reporting for duty. I mean, cutie. [They laugh.]"
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler, [Smoking a pipe.] My best friend died in that uniform. I hate that cat!
That Darn Katz!,Amy," If I had a spray bottle, I'd give him such a spritzing."
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler," I'll tell you one thing. Nothing acts that cute without some ulterior motive. [He gets up and does a small dance, cooing in discomfort.]"
That Darn Katz!,Amy, Aw! You want your diapey changed? [He coos an affirmative.]
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler," [Laying down.] We'll have to watch its every move. [Amy puts on a fresh diaper.] Powder, please."
That Darn Katz!,Amy, Here's my new theory. That is one adorable cat.
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler, I guess I was just jealous. I do miss being Leela's schnookums. I'm going to apologize and hope for a pity pet. [They look over and gasp.]
That Darn Katz!,Leela," [She is kneeling before the cat.] Yes, my lord. Amy and Nibbler are a tewwible thweat. They must be spayed and neutered, wespectivewy. [Nibbler crouches and hisses like a cat.]"
That Darn Katz!,Amy," [She runs into the meeting room, carrying Nibbler.] The cat is evil! We have proof!"
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler, It was summoning a saucer!
That Darn Katz!,Farnsworth," Of course it wanted a saucer, you idiot. A saucer of dewicious cweam. [He has a gray cat in his lap.]"
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler," You fool, this isn't about the cream."
That Darn Katz!,Bender," It's pwonounced ""cweam"". [He also has a cat, in his chest cabinet.]"
That Darn Katz!,Zoidberg," I'm petting mine down to the bone. [He strokes a cat, causing hair to be chopped off.]"
That Darn Katz!,Fry, Just stwoke its fwffy fur.
That Darn Katz!,Hermes, Scwatch its fwubby chin.
That Darn Katz!,Bender, Fweeble its fwooby pwow.
That Darn Katz!,Amy," No, no! [She sneezes and flees with Nibbler.]"
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler, What do cats need with that much yarn and cobalt?
That Darn Katz!,Amy, They're doing something downstairs. We've got to find out what. [She follows her coworkers.]
That Darn Katz!,Bender," Where do you think you're going, no-cat?"
That Darn Katz!,Amy," Uh, the basement. I think I left the air hockey table on."
That Darn Katz!,Bender," Without a cat, you ain't going nowhere. [He points to a sign that says ""All employeez must haz cat to enter!!!"".]"
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler, Can you at least tell us what's going on down there?
That Darn Katz!,Farnsworth," We're certainly not building something sinister, if that's what your implying. Now, come on, Bender. Something sinister won't build itself. [They walk into the elevator.]"
That Darn Katz!,Amy, Professor Katz's last name is Katz. Do you think he has something to do with these cats?
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler," The conclusion is an inescapable as it is moronic. [He wheels out his spaceship.] I say we pay him a visit, and if he won't talk to us, he'll talk to Smith & Wesson, [He pulls out a hand gun.] or, perhaps, Consolidated Head Melter. [He takes out a huge blaster. He and Amy get into the ship and it takes off.]"
That Darn Katz!,Amy," [She knocks on the door then kicks it in.] Professor Katz, we want answers! [Katz just sits in his chair, with his back to them.]"
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler," I warn you, if I have to get cute, it's gonna get ugly. [Katz still doesn't respond. Amy turns the chair.]"
That Darn Katz!,Amy, He's dead!
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler, Wait. What are these strings on his lap? [He pulls them and Katz reacts.] What the... He isn't dead. He's one of those dog-operated puppets that's been adapted for use by a cat!
That Darn Katz!,Amy, So I had my doctorate denied by that fuzzball? [She shoots a picture of the cat.] Bad kitty!
That Darn Katz!,Amy," They actually built the planetary ratchet from my thesis! [The remaining crew are operating the ratchet, supervised by cats. Amy sneezes.] Uh-oh."
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler, What the... [Leela is standing in front of them. She kicks the weapons out of their hands.]
That Darn Katz!,Thubanian Leader," Well, look what the me dragged in."
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler, You can talk!
That Darn Katz!,Thubanian Leader, You can talk?
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler, How ironic. Two hyper-intelligent beings both pretending to be simple house pets!
That Darn Katz!,Thubanian Leader," Say, do you know Obliteron? He pretends to be a hamster, but..."
That Darn Katz!,Amy," Yeah, that's really great. Could you please tell us what's going on?"
That Darn Katz!,Thubanian Leader," What? Oh, right! You see, my associates and I are from the ninth planet of the star you call Thuban. Long ago, life there was ideal. [Flashback  A cat is leaping from scratching posts.] Our sun provided plenty of warm, dozy light. The chicken-salmon roamed free. [Cats pounce on the animals.] Yet disaster loomed. Our planet's rotation was gradually slowing. [Cats are sleeping at night and at day.] At first, it seemed beneficial. Long, dark nights for sleeping, long, sunny days for sleeping. But then it got too hot and too cold. [Cats are meowing in pain, surrounded by fires. Then they are freezing under piles of snow.] Our top scientists went to work, [Cats are looking through a telescope.] At last, they located a planet with the necessary orientation and magnetic field to harness the rotational energy. [The telescope focuses on Earth. End Flashback.]"
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler, Earth!
That Darn Katz!,Thubanian Leader," Indubitably. Although we call it Blue Blue Shiny Ball. [Flashback to Egypt, 3,500 B.C. A saucer lands and cats get out, meowing. The Egyptians look surprised.] In the area now known as Egypt, my people constructed a giant, semi-octahedral antenna to beam Earth's rotational energy to Thuban. [Egyptians are seen building a pyramid.]"
That Darn Katz!,Amy, The Great Pyramid at Giza!
That Darn Katz!,Thubanian Leader," Yes. The Egyptians viewed us as gods, but ironically that was our downfall. [The cats are surrounded by golden statues and are being fed by the Egyptians.] They pampered us with feasts most fancy and vittles most tender. We grew fat and domesticated. [A fat cat is napping on someone's lap. The cat meows a ""Duh""] Thousands of years passed, and our home world was nearing total destruction. [From space, cats can be heard meowing on Thuban. A man the next planet over yells at them to shut up.] But the technology to save our planet was lost. Lost, that is, until I heard you speak at Mars University."
That Darn Katz!,Amy," So you called my thesis a fat sack of barf, and then you stole it?"
That Darn Katz!,Thubanian Leader, Welcome to Academia.
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler, He intends to siphon off Earth's rotational energy!
That Darn Katz!,Amy," Earth will come to a stop, and..."
That Darn Katz!,Thubanian Leader," Half of you will cook, and half of you will freeze. Earth will be one big McDLT. We just got that commercial last year."
That Darn Katz!,Amy," Oh, yeah, smarty paws? You may have built the ratchet but you can't reach the core without 4,000 miles of superconducting wire. [She gasps.] The ball of yarn! [Cats are unraveling the ""yarn"" and it is being ratcheted down.]"
That Darn Katz!,Thubanian Leader, Quite.
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler," Even so, you'd still need a tremendously powerful static charge to trigger the process."
That Darn Katz!,Thubanian Leader, Ever had a cat rub up against you?
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler," If you're propositioning me, I'm not interested."
That Darn Katz!,Thubanian Leader," I'm talking about the charge generated when 50,000 felines rub against a single surface. Professor?"
That Darn Katz!,Thubanian Leader," Soon the world will come to a stop, and there's nothing you can do to stop it. The stopping of the world, that is. It's unstoppable. [He gives an evil laugh.] Excuse me. [He starts chewing on his paw.]"
That Darn Katz!,Thubanian Leader, The Earth is coming to a stop. Keep your eyes on the kitties and push! [The crew are being entranced by the sight of cats playing.]
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler," [Locked in a pet carrier with Amy.] These space cats seem to be employing some form of hypnotic hyper-cuteness. Well, two can play that game. And one of them is me. [He puts on a face and starts cooing.]"
That Darn Katz!,Leela, Nibbler? Poopsie-doodle? [The hypnotized crew stop and looks at Nibbler.]
That Darn Katz!,Thubanian Leader," Mr. Winkles, Smudge-Smudge. Quick, dance with each other."
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler," Aw! [He shakes himself.] Damn, they are good."
That Darn Katz!,Thubanian Leader," We're coming to a full stop. All cats, to your posts!"
That Darn Katz!,Calculon," Catastrophe Beach Party. Scene One. Cue disaster effects, and action! [The entire studio gets through the air. The walls of the building fly off and the letters to the ""Hollywood"" sign follow. A man screams while shooting away.]"
That Darn Katz!,Calculon, Cut! That extra looked at the camera. We'll have to do it again.
That Darn Katz!,Thubanian Leader, And now to transfer your planet's rotational energy to my home world. [He pulls a lever and a large amount of energy blast from the pyramids into space. It hits Thuban 9 and the planet starts spinning.]
That Darn Katz!,Thubanian," [Seeing their planet start to rotate.] Well, now, this calls for a celebration. [All the Thubanians nearby start to Can-can.]"
That Darn Katz!,Hermes," What's all this cat hair on my sweater? [He rubs at the ""H"" on his sweater and it dissipates.]"
That Darn Katz!,Bender, And why am I full of sand? And Tootsie Rolls?
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler, You were all under the spell of those obnoxious space cats.
That Darn Katz!,Thubanian Leader, [The Thubanians are leaving.] Enjoy being broiled alive by the Sun and also the dead bird we've left in your slipper. [He laughs then leaves.]
That Darn Katz!,Farnsworth," Quickly! If we turn the ratchet the other way, perhaps we can restart the Earth. [The ratchet won't move.]"
That Darn Katz!,Hermes," It won't turn. Push harder, Bender!"
That Darn Katz!,Bender," I can't. You should have called my cousin, Turner."
That Darn Katz!,Amy, It's hopeless. Even in theory the device can only apply force in one direction.
That Darn Katz!,Fry, Can someone open a window? It's getting a little warm in here.
That Darn Katz!,Bender, [He opens a window and gets hit by flames.] Is that better?
That Darn Katz!,Amy," Shmezzus, it's hot! Why'd I have to invent that awful device?"
That Darn Katz!,Farnsworth," Amy, technology isn't intrinsically good or evil. It's how it's used. Like the death ray."
That Darn Katz!,Amy," Maybe you're right. I guess that science has to keep pushing forward with the hope that... [She gasps.] That's it! Pushing forward! Professor, I know how to restart the Earth."
That Darn Katz!,Farnsworth, [He scoffs.] You can't suddenly know something just by assembling a committee of words. [He gasps.] That's it. I'll assemble your committee!
That Darn Katz!,Amy," The ratchet won't turn backwards, but what if we kept pushing it forward? [She demonstrates on the hologram.] Earth would start turning again."
That Darn Katz!,Wernstrom," Yes, the wrong direction! [He laughs.]"
That Darn Katz!,Amy, So?
That Darn Katz!,Tate," Gentlemen, [Sexfully.] ladies, [Normally.] let's get this globe trotting."
That Darn Katz!,Amy, [Reading a device.] It's working! Just a little faster!
That Darn Katz!,Zoidberg, But we're plotzing here!
That Darn Katz!,Amy, Then look at Nibbler! [Nibbler is in his naval uniform. He does a little dance. Everyone speeds up.]
That Darn Katz!,Thubanian Leader," [Addressing numerous other Thubanians.] On the whole, Earth's society is worthless. But they do these things called antique rugs that are great for peeing on. [Thuban 9 starts shaking as the rotational energy is returned to Earth. The cats go flying.]"
That Darn Katz!,Farnsworth," And though the world is now spinning in the wrong direction, it's good enough. Well done, Amy."
That Darn Katz!,Wernstrom, I'm honored to begrudgingly present you with your Ph.D. in applied physics.
That Darn Katz!,Tate," Also, some kind of sportsmanship award I had in my glove compartment."
That Darn Katz!,Amy, Yay! I'm finally done with school. How's the job market?
That Darn Katz!,Shpeekenshpell, [He spins to a dog.] Ruff!
That Darn Katz!,Farnsworth," Congratulations, Dr. Wong!"
That Darn Katz!,Kif, Congratulations.
That Darn Katz!,Nibbler, [Still dressing in his naval uniform.] Permission to come aboard?
That Darn Katz!,Leela," Granted, schnookums. [Nibbler climbs into Leela's lap and settles.]"
That Darn Katz!,Farnsworth," You've got a bright future, Amy. As sure as the Sun sets in the east."
That Darn Katz!,,
A Clockwork Origin,Hermes," Item one... Duck! [Most duck just in time, but Bender is clipped by Cubert on a party board.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Prof. Farnsworth," Cubert, you crapscallion! What aren't you in school?"
A Clockwork Origin,Cubert," I couldn't get past the protesters. A bunch of smiling, angry people were handing out these anti-evolution flyers."
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, [He gasps.] Evolution is under attack in our schools? To the science mobile.
A Clockwork Origin,Leela, You mean the ship?
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, Yes. The science mobile!
A Clockwork Origin,Leela," It's just that you've never called it that before, but okay."
A Clockwork Origin,Woman," I don't understand evolution, and I have to protect my kids from understanding it! We will not give in to the thinkers!"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," [Walking to the podium.] You people are as loud as you are ignorant. Now, get back on your turnip trucks and go home!"
A Clockwork Origin,Hydroponic farmer," [Standing in front of a turnip truck.] That is an insultingly accurate stereotype, sir!"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," As a professor of science, I assure you that we did, in fact, evolve from filthy monkey-men."
A Clockwork Origin,Dr. Banjo," I cannot speak for you, sir, but my ancestors were not monkeys. They were orangutans. Hard-working, patriotic orangutans."
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, Dr. Banjo?
A Clockwork Origin,Dr. Banjo," In the fur. And I remind you that evolution is merely a theory. Like gravity, or the shape of the Earth."
A Clockwork Origin,Flying Spaghetti Monster," Hey, Professor, I'm a Flying Spaghetti Monster. You seriously believe I've descended from some kind of flightless manicotti?"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, Yes!
A Clockwork Origin,Banjo," Oh, please. A far more logical explanation is the undisprovable science of Creatureism. All life was created in its present form seven thousand years ago, by a fantastical creature from outer space!"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, Bunk!
A Clockwork Origin,Banjo," Oh! [He shows a hologram of a man and a chimpanzee, with a backwards prohibition sign running through an arrow.] If you elitist, East Coast evolution is real, why has no one found the missing link between modern humans and ancient apes?"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, We did find it! [The arrow is replaced by Homo erectus.] It's called Homo erectus!
A Clockwork Origin,Banjo," Then you have proven my case, sir, for no one has found a link between apes and this Homo erectus. [The arrow is put between before Homo erectus.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," Yes, they have! [The hologram fills in again.] It's called Homo habilis!"
A Clockwork Origin,Banjo, Ah-ha! But no one has found the missing link between ape and this so called Homo habilis.
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," Yes, they have! [The hologram fills in.] It's called Australopithecus africanus!"
A Clockwork Origin,Banjo," Oh-ho! I've got you now! [Time Lapse. The hologram now shows 19 different species of ape. Only Fry and Leela are still there.] Fair enough, but where, then, is the missing link between apes and this Darwinius masillae? Answer me that, Professor!"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," Okay, granted, that one missing link is still missing, but just because we haven't found it doesn't mean it doesn't exist!"
A Clockwork Origin,Banjo, [He scoffs.] Things don't exist simply because you believe in them. Thus sayeth the Almighty Creature in the Sky!
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," I'll show that banana-swilling, poop-slinger! We just need to find that last missing link."
A Clockwork Origin,Leela," I found a missing link. It seems to be half-man, half-toucan. [She shows a human shaped skull with a large beak.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, Not what we're looking for. Throw it in the soup! [She throws it in a pot.]
A Clockwork Origin,Hermes, And here's something. [He holds up a fossilized dog] Uh-oh. It's another one of Fry's dogs.
A Clockwork Origin,Fry," Did you find something, Hermes?"
A Clockwork Origin,Hermes, [Hiding the fossil behind his back.] No. [The dog lands in the soup.]
A Clockwork Origin,Amy, I hate chiseling right after a manicure. Oh! Darn it! I broke off one of my fingers!
A Clockwork Origin,Zoidberg," [He and Cubert are standing near the fossil of a long-necked reptile.] Look, Cubert. The neck on this one. I bet he spent a fortune on ties! [Cubert looks at him, deadpan.] What, too soon?"
A Clockwork Origin,Cubert, I highly doubt a Jurassic Elaphrosaurus has access to neckwear.
A Clockwork Origin,Zoidberg, I knew I should have gone with the ring-around-the-collar joke.
A Clockwork Origin,Bender," Hey, look! I found a robot fossil! [He picks up a spring.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," That's a bedspring, you dumb bedspring! There are no robot fossils!"
A Clockwork Origin,Bender, What? Who says I didn't evolve?
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, Everybody! Robots were created quite recently. It was in all the papers.
A Clockwork Origin,Bender," Then explain this! [He turns around and works on something. He turns around and shows the Professor. He has put eyes on the spring and mounted it on a plaque that says ""I hate Mondays"".]"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," I've hit a rich vein of missing links. Java Man, Piltdown Man, Manfred Mann. [He throws out the skulls as he names them.] Eureka! [He is holding a skull.] It's the elusive missing missing link! This will show Banjo, once and for all!"
A Clockwork Origin,Fry, [He scoops up some soup. Amy's finger is in the spoon.] What the...
A Clockwork Origin,Amy," Oh, that's mine. [She takes it back.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Bender," [He walks up to the Professor, wearing an under-sized Tuxedo.] Hmm, my tux doesn't fit. Probably because I've grown so much since I last wore it, or evolved, one might say."
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, One might not say that! Your tux doesn't fit because you stole it from a boy!
A Clockwork Origin,Bender, You mean a man! It was his Bar Mitzvah.
A Clockwork Origin,Ben Beeler," Welcome, museum members. Or, as I like to call you, future exhibits. [The crowd chuckles weakly.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Zoidberg, [To Cubert.] He's good.
A Clockwork Origin,Beeler," Tonight, we have a new resident here in the hall of Hominids, generously donated by its discoverer, Hubert Farnsworth. Ladies and gentlemen, Homo farnsworth. [A curtain rises, revealing the skull and an artist's recreation of the hominid.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," Once again, science saves the day. The end."
A Clockwork Origin,Beeler," And now, to discuss the scientific implications of this discovery, our new museum curator, Dr. Banjo!"
A Clockwork Origin,Banjo," Thank you Professor Farnsworth, for your generous gift, which has, once and for all dis-proven evolution. [He pulls a cord and a painting of Homo farnsworth riding a dinosaur is revealed.] Behold! Homo farnsworth frolicking with dinosaurs at the moment of creation."
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, Faster! Faster! Just drop me off at that asteroid over there.
A Clockwork Origin,Leela," Wow, this planetoid is completely lifeless."
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, Not lifeless enough! Set up my shack so that I can kick you out of it!
A Clockwork Origin,Fry," [Looking at a polluted pond.] Professor, is this your only water source? It looks like Diet Dr. Pepper."
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, It's not that bad. It's just laden with toxic minerals. But not for long. [He rattles a tube.]
A Clockwork Origin,Fry, What's in the tube?
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, Microscopic Nanobots. [He empties the tube. The robots quickly start cleaning the water.] They're tiny robots I designed to eat up nasty irritants.
A Clockwork Origin,Fry," Speaking of nasty irritants, what's going to become of Cubert?"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," Who? Oh, my son. Don't worry, he's been safely abandoned with his godfather."
A Clockwork Origin,Zoidberg," Cubert,  I felt we needed some father-son bonding time, so I found a couple of  baseball gloves and boiled them up for lunch."
A Clockwork Origin,Cubert, Why don't you just go to Hell!
A Clockwork Origin,Zoidberg, Wait! We still have to discuss the facts of life. What are they?
A Clockwork Origin,Hermes," [He walks out of the Professor's shack.] Okay, I finished moving the last grand piano. Now can we have our pizza?"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," You'll get your damned pizza, you parasite! First, let see if my Nanobots have purified the water yet. [He pours some water from an Erlenmeyer flask on to a microscope slide and examines it.] Ah, the water's as sterile as my milkman-trusting father. But what's this? The Nanobots have gotten more complex."
A Clockwork Origin,Bender," What's that you say? Those robots have evolved all by themselves, you say?"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, It wasn't by themselves! I put them there. I'm a genius. Get over it!
A Clockwork Origin,Amy," Hey look, now they gotten bigger. [The robots are coming onshore.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, Good heavens! Trilobots!
A Clockwork Origin,Leela," Oh, no! My sunglasses were in there!"
A Clockwork Origin,Hermes," Let's get the pizza out of here. [Hermes runs off with the pizza. The crew follows. The Trilobots cannibalize everything, including the Professor's shack and the pianos inside.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Amy," Look, there's a cave-like hole in that mountain. It might be a cave. [The crew runs into the cave and blocks the door with a boulder.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Leela, Does anyone have a lighter?
A Clockwork Origin,Bender, Hang on. [He opens a beer and drinks. He burps and adjusts the flame.]
A Clockwork Origin,Leela," Okay, we've got shelter and just enough precious food to ward off starvation."
A Clockwork Origin,Hermes, It's pizza time. [He passes boxes to the rest of the crew.]
A Clockwork Origin,Amy, Pineapple?
A Clockwork Origin,Hermes, So much for that. [They all throw away the pizza.]
A Clockwork Origin,Zoidberg," Hello, I remembered you like superheroes so I painted you a mural on your wall. [He points to a crude drawing of himself and Cubert in costume.] This is Father-Man. He fights crime to earn Son-Boy's respect. Is it working?"
A Clockwork Origin,Cubert, This is sucky! You suck! Who taught you to do three-point perspective? I could make a better mural with my butt!
A Clockwork Origin,Zoidberg, [Sadly.] Father-Man away. [He scuttles off. Cubert looks ashamed.]
A Clockwork Origin,Hermes, Nothing like a cave for a good night's sleep. So what do we have to eat that's not poisoned with pineapple?
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," I packed plenty of food, but it's all in dehydrated pill form. [He holds up a bottle that says ""Steak Dinner 40 mg. Fixin's 10 mg"".]"
A Clockwork Origin,Leela, Then we need water from that pond. We'll have to fight our way past the Trilobots. [Bender moves the boulder.] Go! Go! Hit anything that moves!
A Clockwork Origin,Fry, Whoa.
A Clockwork Origin,Bender, Wow.
A Clockwork Origin,Amy, A whole forest grew overnight.
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, [He knocks on a tree. It is metal and hollow.] All these trees are robotic. I can't believe how quickly they sprung up.
A Clockwork Origin,Bender, I can. Robots do everything faster. Including evolving and believing how quickly things spring up.
A Clockwork Origin,Leela," [She gets water from the pond and re-hydrates the pill. It turns into a steak.] One thing about Bristol-Myers Squibb, they know how to cook a steak. [She takes a bite.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Fry," [In the pond, using a robotic leaf as a boat.] Look at me, I'm the Ty-D-Bol man. I own a yacht an everyone poops on me. [He is attacked by a robotic Plesiosaurs.] Help! Police!"
A Clockwork Origin,Leela, Everybody grab a club. [The rest of the crew starts hitting the robot.]
A Clockwork Origin,Fry," [The robot throws opens its mouth and Fry hits the ground, several feet away.] Oh, big, tough water guy, why don't you come up here on land and... [A robotic T-Rex grabs him in its jaws.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Amy, Look out for the next thing!
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," Great Scott, a Tricycle-tops!"
A Clockwork Origin,Fry, Woo-hoo! Throw down dinosaurs of the land and sea. [Something crows and Fry screams. A robot Pterosaur carries him off.] This is a cool way to die!
A Clockwork Origin,Cubert," Dr. Zoidberg? I'm sorry for treating you like a total Zoidberg... I mean, loser. [Zoidberg comes out of his dumpster.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Zoidberg, Go on.
A Clockwork Origin,Cubert, It's just that I get bullied a lot. I guess I kinda make fun of people as a defense mechanism.
A Clockwork Origin,Brett Blob," Hey, Cubert, is that your family mansion? [He laughs.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Cubert, Why don't you ask your mom? She's coming over for a sex visit.
A Clockwork Origin,Zoidberg," Don't worry, I know just how to handle bullies. Just pretend like you're pathetic. Help, I'm scared. I wet myself. I'm crying like a baby and I'm soaking in pee, but what else is new? [He bursts into tears.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Brett," [He laughs.] The pee-babies peed themselves. I'm off to pottery class, dorkwads."
A Clockwork Origin,Zoidberg, And that's that.
A Clockwork Origin,Cubert, Woah! You're like some kind of dumpster Jedi.
A Clockwork Origin,Zoidberg," So, you wanna come in maybe? [He opens the other lid.] I've got a nice pound cake with a footprint on it."
A Clockwork Origin,Fry, [Trying to avoid the babies Pterosaurs.] Ah! Don't eat my butt!
A Clockwork Origin,Leela," If this is anything like killing that pigeon on my balcony, we've got our work cut out for us."
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," Look out, a solar flare!"
A Clockwork Origin,Amy, What the shmell happened?
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," A mass extinction. [Fry lands unceremoniously near them.] That solar flare created a huge electromagnetic pulse that while harmless to organic life, short-circuited the robo-dinosaurs."
A Clockwork Origin,Leela, Convenient.
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," Only puny, mammal-like robots cowering in caves could survive such a catastrophe."
A Clockwork Origin,Bender," Guys, guys! I taught myself to knit."
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," Wait a moment. If we could scavenge the right parts from these robo-dinos, I might be able to construct a rudimentary spaceship to get us off this planet!"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," Oh, well, it took almost two hours, but it's finished. [The crew cheers.] Now let's go... to sleep. It's solar powered, so we can't take off until sunrise."
A Clockwork Origin,Bender," Well, let's find something comfy to bed down on. [Time Lapse. Bender is sleeping on top of Fry, Hermes, and the Professor.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Fry," Hey, looky here. [Mechanical flowers have sprung up,  there are animals everywhere.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Hermes, Sweet robot swan of Botswana!
A Clockwork Origin,Bender," Looks like the fittest did a little surviving last night, huh?"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, Whatever.
A Clockwork Origin,Fry," Hey, looky there. [Amy and Leela are still being abducted.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Hermes, Those robo-cavemen have kidnapped our human regular-women!
A Clockwork Origin,Fry, We gotta save them! But the only weapon we have is my fan dance. [He shows off a fan.]
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," Hmm, I believe I can fashion a slingshot using this robot wishbone and this elastic from my pants. [His pants fall down.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Amy," I think they want wives, so just play along. If it doesn't work out, we'll still get half their rocks."
A Clockwork Origin,Leela," I can earn my own rocks! Also, I don't want any rocks!"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," Well, it took almost twelve hours, but it's finished."
A Clockwork Origin,Hermes," It's too dark now, but first thing tomorrow we'll slingshot them like they've never been slangshat. [They go into their cave.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Fry, What's going on? How did we save you?
A Clockwork Origin,Amy," It was the weirdest thing. We went to sleep, and when we woke up, our cave husbands were gone."
A Clockwork Origin,Leela, I'm gonna miss Spencer.
A Clockwork Origin,Dr. Widnar," Don't be afraid, little guys. I'm not gonna hurt you. [She throws a net on Fry.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Fry, [He whistles.] Nice net.
A Clockwork Origin,Widnar, You... you can speak?
A Clockwork Origin,Hermes, Dread my locks! A fully-evolved robot human.
A Clockwork Origin,Widnar," I'm Dr. Widnar, a naturalist."
A Clockwork Origin,Bender," And I'm Bender, baby. My human slaves and I come from a planet where organic life and robotic life evolved side by side."
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," Oh, shut up!"
A Clockwork Origin,Widnar," Amazing. [She pokes Hermes.] I've theorized that carbon-based, fat-filled life could exist, but until today, I never had any proof."
A Clockwork Origin,Leela, Good for you. Can we go home now? [Widnar throws a net on Leela.]
A Clockwork Origin,Widnar," Welcome, museum members, or, as I like to call you, future exhibits. [A robot coughs.] I now present my latest discovery, the amazing non-mechanical man, Homo farnsworth."
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," Thank you. I must say, I'm so proud to see what you've blossomed into since I first created your ancestors."
A Clockwork Origin,Widnar, What?
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, I thought you knew. You all evolved from some filth-gobbling Nanobots I designed. I dumped them in one of your ponds a few days ago.
A Clockwork Origin,Widnar, But this is Creationist talk!
A Clockwork Origin,Robot Farnsworth, He speaks lies! The Earth was created in eons not days.
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," Yes, relative to you, it was eons, but, well, look at this hologram I took the day before yesterday of a robot frolicking with a robo-dinosaur. [He shows a hologram of Bender riding one of the dinosaurs. The crowd gasps again.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Widnar, I don't want to live on this planet anymore! [She blasts off.]
A Clockwork Origin,Robo-Police, You're under arrest for crimes against science.
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, [He is dragged off.] No! Could you drag me by the restroom?
A Clockwork Origin,Robot, Go back to Roboklahoma!
A Clockwork Origin,Superior Gort Judge," Order! In the matter of Everyone v. Farnsworth, the alleged creationist faces a sentence of death by melting. Who is representing the accused?"
A Clockwork Origin,Leela, I am...
A Clockwork Origin,Bender," I am, your Honor. [Everyone else gasps.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," Bender, what the Hell are you doing?"
A Clockwork Origin,Bender," Shut up, I'm billing you by the hour! Besides, I'm a robot, they'll listen to me. [He clears his throat.] Ladytrons and gentlebots..."
A Clockwork Origin,Superior Gort Prosecutor," Objection. In the absence of pants, defense's suspenders serve no purpose."
A Clockwork Origin,Superior Gort Judge," I'm going to allow them, for now."
A Clockwork Origin,Bender," Thank you. Your Honor, this meat-man does not deny that we robots are the glorious products of evolution. He claim only to have played a small role in supplying the initial machinery. I ask you, is that so crazy? Yes, it's completely crazy, and that is why you must find him not guilty by reason of insanity! [Everyone gasps again.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," Objection, I'm not crazy! I created you all and I came here in a homemade spaceship and lived in a cave. If you don't believe me, ask my uncle."
A Clockwork Origin,Superior Gort Judge," Prosecutor, your opening statement?"
A Clockwork Origin,Superior Gort Prosecutor," [on cell-phone.]  Yeah, honey. I'll be home by dinner. [To the Judge.]  The prosecution rests, your Honor."
A Clockwork Origin,Superior Gort Judge," Very well, we will reconvene when the jury reaches a verdict."
A Clockwork Origin,Bender," [To Farnsworth.] Son, you in a whole mess of trouble."
A Clockwork Origin,Superior Gort Judge, Has the jury reached a verdict?
A Clockwork Origin,Robotic gas forms," No, we have not, for we have evolved to a high state of consciousness. [They are all energy beings.] In the grand scheme, all physical beings are but yokels. Now, settle your petty squabbles and get the hell out. [A blinding flash occurs and the energy beings are gone.]"
A Clockwork Origin,Bender," [To Farnsworth.] That'll be $10,000."
A Clockwork Origin,Banjo," Well, digital photographs don't lie. I admit that what you witnessed may have been some form of evolution."
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," I'm glad you agree, Dr. Banjo."
A Clockwork Origin,Banjo, Evolution set into motion by a wise and all-knowing Creator. You.
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," [He chuckles.] Well I don't know about all-knowing. And I admit it's possible, however unlikely, that some wise and all-knowing alien monster set evolution in motion here on Earth."
A Clockwork Origin,Bender, And the Creator could also be a robot.
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth, Then who built this so-called Creator-robot?
A Clockwork Origin,Banjo, Some magical bearded robot in the sky? [He and Farnsworth laugh.]
A Clockwork Origin,Bender, I guess that would be stupid. Never mind.
A Clockwork Origin,Farnsworth," Then it's settled. Finally, a world in which I'm happy to raise my son!"
A Clockwork Origin,Zoidberg," Good, cause I'm sick of him!"
A Clockwork Origin,Zoidberg, [Over credits.] I'm serious. He's a terrible person.
A Clockwork Origin,,
The Prisoner of Benda,,
The Prisoner of Benda,Linda," Tonight, at 11 00."
The Prisoner of Benda,Morbo, Doom!
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela," Boy, that thing's big. Fry, is my colossal eye too big?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry," No, it's what makes you you."
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela," But it's so round, so hideously round."
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry," Leela, listen. You're the most beautiful woman I've ever known."
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela, Oh. So you only care about my looks?
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry," No, I.... What?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Linda," [on TV.] Finally, New New York got a blast of class today as Nikolai, playboy ruler of the Robo-Hungarian Empire, arrived aboard his extravagant, caviar-powered yacht."
The Prisoner of Benda,Nikolai," [on TV.] I'm just a humble emperor, with a big, big crown!"
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender, [He turns off the TV.] Of course I'm not planning to steal that crown!
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela, What?
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," True. I've always dreamt of being an emperor. You know, for Halloween, and then forever. But heisting those jewels would be difficult."
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela, You'd be stupid to try.
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender, I'll need accomplices. A sexy vamp to distract and tie up the guard.
The Prisoner of Benda,Amy, Never! [She walks away.]
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender, A claw man to slip past the metal detector and cut the alarm wires.
The Prisoner of Benda,Zoidberg," Sorry, I'm set for life after that last job. [He takes an eel out of a bucket label ""Aquarium Garbage"" and wraps it around himself like a cravat.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," And finally, a chump, to be caught on video and later arrested."
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry," As I told you on Sucker-Punch Day, I'm through being a chump."
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," Of course, it would all require split-second robotic timing. That's were I come in. You see, I own a watch. [He pulls out a pocket watch.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth, There. This time I'm sure I've fixed the mind-switcher.
The Prisoner of Benda,Amy," Good, I'm sick of cleaning up those heaps of dead monkeys. But why would you want your mind in a new body?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth," Well, as a man enters his 18th decade, he thinks back on the mistakes he's made in life."
The Prisoner of Benda,Amy, Like the heaps of dead monkeys?
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth," Science cannot move forward without heaps! No, what I regret is the youth I wasted playing it safe."
The Prisoner of Benda,Amy, I wasted my youth porking out.
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth," Yes, I remember. [He points to a picture of a fat Amy, captioned ""2997 Employee of the Year"".]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Amy, Would you please take that down? It's making me hungry.
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth," Funny, I could use a little extra meat on my bones. [He moves his coat and shows that he is just skin and bones.] Wait a second, if we switch bodies, I could live life to the extreme, and you could indulge your demonic food lust."
The Prisoner of Benda,Amy," [She gasps.] We are just the people this mind-switcher was made for by us! [They sit in the chairs.] Wait, can I still change my mind?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth, Let's find out. [He pushes a button.]
The Prisoner of Benda,Amy, [in Farnsworth’s body.] It didn't work you doddering old [She gasps.]
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth," [in Amy’s body.] Ah! Cartilage! Dude, I bid you a fond cowabunga! I'm off to laugh at the Reaper. [He shuffles off. Cut to a mountain where he is party boarding.] Look out, world, here I... [He hits a rock face and snow falls on him. Cut to Planet Express. Amy is eating Bologna substitute from a squeeze bottle.] I'm sorry, Amy, but your body is not up to the task. Also, I don't care for these boobs flapping every which way. Now quit your bologna-gargling and let's switch back to our original bodies."
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," Body switcher, eh? Mayhap the heist is back on. Who needs accomplices, if I can just use their bodies."
The Prisoner of Benda,Amy," [in Farnsworth’s body.] Professor, what's not happening?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth," [in Amy’s body.] Bad news, me. [He presses a button and a diagram of their brains comes up.] I failed to take into account the cerebral immune response."
The Prisoner of Benda,Amy, [in Farnsworth’s body.] You idiot!
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth," [in Amy’s body.] Once two bodies have switched minds, they can never switch back. [A dramatic cord plays as Amy covers her mouth.] However, perhaps they can. Maybe we can swap back using a third body for temporary storage space."
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender, I'm 60% storage space. [He bangs his chassis.]
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth," [in Amy’s body.] Eh, wha? [He and Bender sit in the machine and switch bodies.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Amy’s body.] Well, I'm off to the royal yacht for a quick seduce-and-snatch. [He takes the pocket watch out of the Professor's chest cabinet.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Amy, [in Farnsworth’s body.] See ya!
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth [in Bender’s body.]," Now then, Amy, we'll simply switch bodies, and then we'll... we'll... No, I'd be back in my body, but then you and Bender would be switched. And the Amy and Bender bodies can't trade minds again, since they just did."
The Prisoner of Benda,Amy, [in Farnsworth’s body.] Oh no! Is it possible to get everyone back to normal using four or more bodies?
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth [in Bender’s body.]’’, I'm not sure. I'm afraid we need to use... MATH.
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Amy’s body.] Stupid, air-needing lungs. [He climbs onto the boat. He gasps.] The crown jewels. Now I just have to locate the guard and seduce him in... [He checks the watch.] Four seconds?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Basil, Who goes there?
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Amy’s body.] [Counting down.] Three, two, one. Hello, big boy. [He comes out, imitating porn music and dancing.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Basil," Silence! I am Basil, the emperor's cousin and chief of his royal guard. And I shall not be seduced by a... [He gets punched and falls down.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Amy’s body.] I said, ""Wow chica wow wow""."
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela," Professor, what's the matter."
The Prisoner of Benda,Amy, [in Farnsworth’s body.] I'm Amy. The Professor and I switched bodies.
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela," Oh, lord."
The Prisoner of Benda,Amy," [in Farnsworth’s body.] All I wanted was to gorge myself a little, but I can't digest anything with these false teeth and this hit-or-miss colon."
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela," At least, you get the senior discount at the movies. I hate paying $14 to see Nicolas Cage solve things."
The Prisoner of Benda,Amy," [in Farnsworth’s body.] If you want to save $2, we could switch bodies."
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela," We could always switch back, right? [Amy grins.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry," Hey, Leela. Mmm. What smells saturated?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Amy, [in Leela’s body.] Deep-fried ice cream sandwich wrapped in frosting and lightly baconed.
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry, Woah. That sounds like something Amy would say and eat.
The Prisoner of Benda,Amy," [in Leela’s body.] I am Amy. Leela and I used the Professor's mind-switching machine. [She puts ketchup on her ""creation""."
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry, So Leela's in your body?
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela, [in Farnsworth’s body.] Not exactly. [Fry makes a revolted sound.] Aha! You do only like me for my body.
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry," That is entirely not true, sir!"
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Amy's body.] Now to go switch bodies with Zoidberg, sneak past the metal detector and clip the alarm wires, all in less than... [He checks the watch.] Ten minutes ago! Oh! [He throws the watch through the metal detector, setting it off. Alarms sound and lights focus on him. Nikolai walks up behind him and cocks a gun.] Uh, could you come back when my chump gets here?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Nikolai," Now then, what is a filthy human doing aboard my royal yacht?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Amy’s body.] With all due respect, Your Majesty, I'm a robot like you. I just switch bodies with some bimbo. Go ahead, ask me something only a robot would know."
The Prisoner of Benda,Nikolai," Ah, a reverse Turing test, eh? Very good. What is the square root of nine?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Amy’s body.] Hold on, let me just get out a pencil. [He sighs.] Okay, look, I'm not that kind of robot. I'm more this kind. [He starts beat boxing and Moonwalking."
The Prisoner of Benda,Basil, He steps forwards but moves backwards.
The Prisoner of Benda,Nikolai, By the gods! he is a machine!
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth," [in Bender’s body.] No, that won't restore everyone, either. Besides, I don't want my decrepit old body back! I'm running away with this invincible robot body and joining something!"
The Prisoner of Benda,Fishy Joe," I paid for 15 Robot Clowns per cubic meter of car, and you're barely giving me 12. Now crumple up and get in... And fasten your seat belts."
The Prisoner of Benda,Robot Clown," Oh, come on!"
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth," [in Bender’s body.] Good day. I am Nonchalanto, the robot daredevil. And my dream is to risk my life in strange and original ways."
The Prisoner of Benda,Fishy Joe, Hmm. You don't look so foolhardy to me.
The Prisoner of Benda,Fishy Joe, That's the dumbest thing anybody's ever done. Your hired! [A robot trapeze artist falls to the ground.]
The Prisoner of Benda,Nikolai, So you’re a common bending robot with a human peasant roommate?
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Amy’s body.] Oh, crap, that is what I am!"
The Prisoner of Benda,Nikolai," No, Bender, I envy you. I'm so bored with all of these pretentious trappings. The jewels, the parties, the beautiful robo women."
The Prisoner of Benda,Princess Flavia, Hello.
The Prisoner of Benda,Nikolai," My fiancée, Princess Flavia. Dearest, meet Bender. He's a robot in the body of a Chinese Martian physicist."
The Prisoner of Benda,Flavia, How tedious. [She walks off.]
The Prisoner of Benda,Nikolai," Oh, to escape this gilded cage for a day."
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Amy’s body.] You know, we could trade bodies. I could take over the humdrum royal stuff and you could be an regular Joe for a day. [He stares at the crown.] Or more. Much more."
The Prisoner of Benda,Nikolai," In that horrible non-robot body. Sir, I have my standards."
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Amy’s body.] Ah, but what if I could put you in my fabulous bending-robot body?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Nikolai," [He giggles.] Me, posing as a lowly bending unit? How wicked! But wait, I'm supposed to give a speech at the UN tomorrow. Can I trust you to do it?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender, [in Amy’s body.] You can trust anything.
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry, So now Leela's all crotchety because she thinks I'm not attracted to her in the Professor's body.
The Prisoner of Benda,Hermes," You aren't, are you?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry, Of course not! But I was willing to lie about it. What more can a man do?
The Prisoner of Benda,Hermes, A man can give her a toke of her own medicine.
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry," Yes! I can put my mind in a hideous body and show Leela she's not attracted to me. But it would have to be a really, really disgusting body."
The Prisoner of Benda,Zoidberg, Friends! Friends! I've got barnacles on my tuchus! [He shows them.]
The Prisoner of Benda,Hermes, The long search is over.
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender, [in Amy’s body.] Wait here and earn interest while I find my robot body.
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender, [in Amy’s body.] Professor?
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela, [in Farnsworth’s body.] Leela. Amy?
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender, [in Amy’s body.] Bender. Have you seen my body? I think the Professor's in it.
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela," [in Farnsworth’s body.] Yeah, he said something about running away. Then he ran away."
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender, [in Amy’s body.] What? Wither?
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Amy’s body.] What am I gonna do? I got an emperor all patsied up to switch bodies, but only with another robot!"
The Prisoner of Benda,Wash bucket, Wash bucket full.
The Prisoner of Benda,Scruffy, Scruffy's work here is done. [He props up the mop and goes to the couch. He lies down and starts reading Extra-Long Honkers.]
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender, [in Amy’s body.] [He looks at the wash bucket calculatingly. Cut to the Professor's lab where he and the wash bucket switch bodies.]
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender, [in the wash bucket’s body.] Now to find Emperor Von Richendoof.
The Prisoner of Benda,Wash bucket, [in Amy’s body.] Now to find Scruffy. [She walks past Fry and Zoidberg.]
The Prisoner of Benda,Zoidberg, Switch bodies? I don't see why not. I also don't see why. [He and Fry switch bodies.]
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry," [in Zoidberg’s body.] In your face, Leela. [He walks out, past Nikolai and Bender wash bucket’s body.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Nikolai," If you're a bender, why is your body full of fetid water?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in the wash bucket’s body.] If you're an emperor, why don't you shut up? Move it, Fry. [He pushes Zoidberg out of his seat and switches with Nikolai.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Nikolai’s body.] Well, so long."
The Prisoner of Benda,Nikolai, [in the wash bucket’s body.] Wait! Point me to my normal human roommate!
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Nikolai’s body.] That's him there, maybe. [He points to Zoidberg.] Got to go!"
The Prisoner of Benda,Zoidberg, [in Fry’s body.] Robot?
The Prisoner of Benda,Nikolai," [in the wash bucket’s body.] Yes, 'tis I, Bender. Do you not recognize your own best friend?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Zoidberg," [in Fry’s body.] Aha! The guy in this body has a friend! Bender, old pal! It's me, the Fry! [He hugs Nikolai.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela," [in Farnsworth’s body.] But then Nicolas Cage discovered that the real treasure was his family. Yes, I'll hold."
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry," [in Zoidberg’s body.] Hey, Leela, look! I'm in Zoidberg."
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela, [in Farnsworth’s body.] [She put a hand over her right eye.] Fry?
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry," [in Zoidberg’s body.] Oh, you're not so shallow that you find me repulsive because of my body, are you? [He makes tentacles come out his armpits.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela," [in Farnsworth’s body.] [She gags.] Not at all. [The door opens. Amy has made Leela's body overweight. She unwraps some butter and eats it.] Amy, stop it! Fry, help! She's turning me into a parade float!"
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry, [in Zoidberg’s body.] Eww! look at her! [Amy leave the room.]
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela, [in Farnsworth’s body.] Oh. So you're so shallow that my body disgusts you if it puts on a little extra weight?
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry, [in Zoidberg’s body.] That wasn't a little extra weight.
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela, [in Farnsworth’s body.] Admit it! You don't care about the inner me at all!
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry," [in Zoidberg’s body.] No, you admit it! You'd be ashamed to be seen in public with someone as hideous as me!"
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela, [in Farnsworth’s body.] Would not!
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry," [in Zoidberg’s body.] Oh, yeah? Then I challenge you to a romantic dinner at Elzar's tonight."
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela, [in Farnsworth’s body.] It's on.
The Prisoner of Benda,Hermes, Sweet orca of Majorca! You make Fat Albert look like Normal Albert!
The Prisoner of Benda,Amy, [in Leela’s body.] I don't know what to do. Do you think I should eat more butter?
The Prisoner of Benda,Hermes," I am putting a stop to this, right now! Come on! We're switching bodies."
The Prisoner of Benda,Amy," [in Leela’s body.] Hermes, no! I'll ruin your body, too!"
The Prisoner of Benda,Hermes, Three decades of the munchies beat you to it.
The Prisoner of Benda,Big Bertha," You make quite a show, young man. [A robot Howitzer rolls in.] You remind me of myself as a young cannon."
The Prisoner of Benda,Chainsaw-Eating Robot, Big Bertha is the circus's grande dame. She shoots robots through the air.
The Prisoner of Benda,Bertha, [She belches and shoots a robot into the air.] Excuse me. Too much goulash.
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth, [in Bender’s body.] I've always wanted to be shot out of something. How about a quick blast after lunch.
The Prisoner of Benda,Bertha," Alas, a fine big one like you would shatter my barrel. But, ah, to amaze the crowd once more."
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth," [in Bender’s body.] I understand the problem of age, but suppose I could put you into a new body?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Bertha," Never! My body may be old, but it is mine, and every crack a memory of heavy things shot a long way. Good day.[She rolls away.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Nikolai’s body.] Ah! I have everything I every wanted. Money, wealth, riches. Yet something's missing. A hot princess with which to get(?) grizzly."
The Prisoner of Benda,Flavia, [She walks in front of Bender.] Hello.
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Nikolai’s body.] Hello, baby! [She pulls out a gun.] Huh? Hey, what's going on here? And why are you kissing my dashing cousin instead of me?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Flavia," Nikolai, you imperial fool! We've been having an affair for 700 years."
The Prisoner of Benda,Basil," At long last, I shall kill you, blame the burglar and inherit the throne. [He pulls out a sword. Bender spits the jewels out.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Flavia," Farewell, Nikolai."
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Nikolai’s body.] Wait! I'm not Nikolai! I'm Bender, the fabulous body-switching burglar. [He moonwalks.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Basil," So you are. However, you do have Nikolai's body, and that's the part we want to kill. [He turns on the sword. It works like a chain saw. Basil forces Bender to back up and fall overboard.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry," [in Zoidberg’s body.] Great food, huh? [He burps out of his gills. The rest of the restaurant groans in disgust.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela, [in Farnsworth’s body.] Ew!
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry," [in Zoidberg’s body.] I'm sorry, Leela. I hope that didn't make you ashamed to be seen with me."
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela," [in Farnsworth’s body.] No, it only makes you more attractive. [She spits her dentures into her wine glass. Everyone watching groans again.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry, [in Zoidberg’s body.] Ew!
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela," [in Farnsworth’s body.] Oh, did my bodily infirmity embarrass you?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry, [in Zoidberg’s body.] Not at all. It's just another thing that makes you a very special lady.
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela," [in Farnsworth’s body.] You mean, like my penis? [Fry gags and a worm comes out of his mouth.] Eh!"
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry, [in Zoidberg’s body.] Admit it! You're disgusted by me!
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela," [in Farnsworth’s body.] No, you're disgusted by me!"
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry, [in Zoidberg’s body.] I'm as attracted to you as I've ever been!
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela," [in Farnsworth’s body.] Prove it! [They start making out while the other restaurant goers scream. Pan over to Amy, in Hermes' body, watching them. The ice cream she is about to eat falls onto the table.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Zoidberg," [in Fry's body.] Well, Bender, here's our apartment that we live in everyday. [He opens the door and looks inside.] A floor? We live like kings?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Nikolai," [in the wash bucket’s body.] Kings? Silence! Like you, I'm a common lout. Now fetch me some working-class cognac from our brandy storeroom that you know how to find."
The Prisoner of Benda,Zoidberg," [in Fry's body.] [He starts looking in the dishwasher, which he breaks and rips off the wall. Nikolai screams as the kitchen starts to flood.] Relax, Bender. I'll dry up that leak with this heating box. [He rips the oven off the wall and places it where the dishwasher was. Gas starts leaking.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Nikolai," [in the wash bucket’s body.] [Finding cigars in a cabinet.]  Ah, cigars. Light me up, old friend. [Zoidberg pulls out a lighter. Cut to outside where a fireball shoots out of the building. Bender, in Nikolai's body, runs past. Basil and Flavia are chasing him. Two robots walk in front of Bender.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Robot," There you are, Emperor Nikolai. It's time for your speech to the UN."
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender, [in Nikolai's body.] The what now? [Laser blasts hit the robots. Bender screams and runs away.]
The Prisoner of Benda,Scruffy, Miss Wong?
The Prisoner of Benda,Wash bucket," [in Amy’s body.] No, Scruffy, I am wash bucket. I love you. Wash bucket has always loved you. [They kiss but Scruffy pulls away.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Scruffy," It's wrong, wash bucket. Oh, it would be sweet for a while, but in the back of our minds, we'd know that I'm a man and you're janitorial equipment."
The Prisoner of Benda,Wash bucket," [in Amy’s body.]  In another city, we could be anyone we want!"
The Prisoner of Benda,Scruffy," Go. Go now, before I beg you to stay."
The Prisoner of Benda,Scruffy, Yep.
The Prisoner of Benda,Nixon," Please welcome an insane dictator, and one heck of a bowler, Emperor Nikolai!"
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Nikolai's body.] [He runs on stage.] Thanks, Nixon. How we doing?"
The Prisoner of Benda,Woman," I love you, Your Majesty."
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Nikolai's body.] Shut up, madam ambassador, I know it. Anyhow, [He clears his throat.] I'd now like to digress from my prepared remarks to say, ""I'm done"". [The ambassadors cheer.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Basil," [He jumps onto the stage and holds Bender at sword-point.] Ladies and gentlemen, this robot is an impostor! [The ambassadors all gasp. The Chinese ambassador puts his hand to his translator and listens. After a moment, he gasps. Basil turns on his sword.] I shall enjoy this."
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender, [in Nikolai's body.] Not me.
The Prisoner of Benda,Chainsaw-Eating Robot," That devil, Basil, will kill our emperor."
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth, [in Bender’s body.] You're Robo-Hungarian?
The Prisoner of Benda,Robot Carny, Yes. Our nation's chief export is carnies.
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth, [in Bender’s body.] If only there was some way I could get to the UN to help.
The Prisoner of Benda,Bertha," There is. Get in, Nonchalanto."
The Prisoner of Benda,Chainsaw-Eating Robot," Bertha, no! It would kill you!"
The Prisoner of Benda,Bertha, I have not so much time left anyhow.
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth," [in Bender’s body.] But you could get a new body! You could have a rich, full life!"
The Prisoner of Benda,Bertha," I am trying to have a rich, full life. [The Chainsaw-Eating Robot lights the fuse.] Long live Robo-Hungary! [The impact breaks Bertha's barrel. She groans and is caught by the Chainsaw-Eating Robot.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender, [in Nikolai's body.] Me! Thank God you've come!
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth, [in Bender’s body.] [He pulls out his own sword.] This is for Big Bertha. [He missed and gets the sword stuck in a podium.] That is not what I meant to give you for Big Bertha.
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela, [in Farnsworth’s body.] That was nice.
The Prisoner of Benda,Fry," [in Zoidberg’s body.] Oh, yeah. [Leela turns on the TV and sees what is happening in the UN. They both gasp. Fry's crest pops up.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Nixon, Ow. Ow. Arrooo! [He gets thrown off-stage and his jar shatters.]
The Prisoner of Benda,Basil," Whoever you are, you're the bravest robot I've ever seen. [He trips the Professor.] I like killing brave things."
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth," [in Bender’s body.] Good, because I've got 20 of them per cubic meter. [He opens his chest cabinet and the carnies fly out and mow down Basil.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Boy," When I grow up, I wanna be a diplomat!"
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Nikolai's body.] Well, if they're is one thing I learned, it's a lesson. I believe this belongs to you. [He reaches into his chest cabinet and takes out a phony crown. He puts it on Nikolai's head.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Nikolai," [in the wash bucket’s body.] I shall sell it to help the common folk, now that I understand their misery."
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender," [in Nikolai's body.] Yeah, good luck with that."
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela," [in Farnsworth’s body.] I must say, Hermes, you've got a smoking-hot body."
The Prisoner of Benda,Hermes, [in Leela’s body.] I was inspired by Amy. [Hermes' body has lost most of its fat.]
The Prisoner of Benda,Leela, [in Farnsworth’s body.] Wow! How did you do it.
The Prisoner of Benda,Amy," [in Hermes’s body.] Well, there I was at Elzar's, eating a nice pork sundae and suddenly, I just lost my appetite. [Leela strokes Fry's mouth flaps.] Forever."
The Prisoner of Benda,Sweet Clyde, [He is working on an equation.] Q to the E to the D!
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth, [in Bender’s body.] So it is possible us all to get back to our original bodies?
The Prisoner of Benda,Bubblegum," Stone-cold munching, Prof. Sweet Clyde, characterize your inversion theorem."
The Prisoner of Benda,Sweet Clyde," Basically, no matter how permuted-up your minds are, they can be restored using, at most, two extra players. [He and Bubblegum high-five.]"
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth, [in Bender’s body.] And they say pure math has no real-world applications!
The Prisoner of Benda,Sweet Clyde, Everybody back in their zones? [The crew gives various affirmations.]
The Prisoner of Benda,Farnsworth," Ah! My body may be old, but it is mine. Brilliant work, Clyde. You'll win the NBA’s highest academic honor for this."
The Prisoner of Benda,Nikolai," Also, I'm making you a duke. [He pins a medal to Clyde jersey.] So long filthy commoners."
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender, ¡Adiós! And I'm left with the real jewels safely inside... [He checks his chest cabinet.] ...his compartment!
The Prisoner of Benda,Bender, [Over credits.] All right. I'll need accomplices.
The Prisoner of Benda,,
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,,
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,The Scary Announcer," You're taking a vacation from normalcy, the setting  a weird motel where the bed is stained with mystery, and there's also some mystery floating in the pool. Your key card may not open the exercise room because someone smeared mystery on the lock. But it will open the Scary Door."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Announcer," Submitted for your Emmy consideration, a popular Senator with unpopular ideas."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Senator, There's no such thing as space aliens!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Man, Oh? How can you be so sure them aliens ain't already among us?
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Senator, I'll tell you how! [takes off the man's face revealing an alien lifeform] Because you ARE ONE!!!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Hey, I was watching that! The Saints just needed a field goal to tie!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd," Lrrr, you lazy ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8! You said you would conquer a planet today, but you have not even shed your skin yet!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Yes, Ndnd. I heard you the first hundred times. I'll conquer something tomorrow after I fuel up on your disgusting egg-white omelets."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd, You want yolks? Fine! Enjoy your stroke. [She throws the remote at him and walks out.]
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Fry, Erth. [He mimics laser fire as a spaceship blows up the planet.]
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Invader X, Ha ha ha! I am conquering Erth.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leelis Lane," Not so fast, Invader X! Here comes Delivery-Boy Man!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Delivery-Boy Man," Special delivery for Invader X! Laser eye power! [He shoots Invader X's ship with his laser eyes. The ship explodes. Cut to  Delivery-Boy Man in the ship, with Invader X threatening him in a gun.] Hand magnet power! [The gun flies into Delivery-Boy Man's hand.]"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leelis Lane," [She comes free.] Yay! I'm unbuckled! [Delivery-Boy Man uses his ""hand magnet power"" to bring Lane to him."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Invader X," Stop it, you hero!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Delivery-Boy Man, Reverse-time power!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Delivery-Boy Man, It's earlier now. [He and Lane kiss.]
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Fry, So? What do you think of my comic?
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Bender," Let me put it like this. After I leave here, I'm getting a memory enema."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela," If I may offer some constructive criticism, there was never any real peril. I mean, the delivery guy has, like, 30 superpowers."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Fry," Well, that's because he was bitten by a radioactive superman!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Zoidberg, This is wonderful!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Fry," It is, isn't it? Wait, those are the ads."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Zoidberg, These X-ray specs will really take the guesswork out of surgery. No more chopping blindly in the goop.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Prof. Farnsworth," Don't waste your allowance, Zoidberg. This stuff is butt-grade crap."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Paper-hatted salesman, [on an ad] Amuse your friends with real vomit!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Man #1, [on an ad] Throw your voice!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Woman, [on an ad] Sea monkeys!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Man #2, [on an ad] Throw your sea monkeys!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Farnsworth, [on an ad] My disintegrator ray really works!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Amy, But that's you.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Farnsworth," That's how I know it's bunkum. The Farnsworth Novelty Disintegrator Ray is nothing more than a common teleporter ray. [He shoots a trashcan, it reappears next to him and he throws the toy away.] Worthless toy."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Fry, I'm sick of being critiqued by nitpicking nerds. I'm taking this to a comic book convention!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Amy," Smeesh, it's crowded!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Bender, Good thing everyone is freshly bathed and groomed.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Nerd, What are you doing? [He pulls the toy out of Zoidberg's mouth.] That's the rare Zapp Brannigan with recording session blooper! [He presses a button on the figure.]
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Action Figure, Don't tell me how to do the line. It sickens me.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Zoidberg, But the sign said there was a mint in the box.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Groening," Thank you so... Okay, thanks... Thanks so... Settle down!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Groening," So, anyway, we're really excited to show you guys the pilot for our new TV series."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Cohen," It's set it the year 4000, and we call it Futurella!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Groening, Wow. Fox has really streamlined the process.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Bill Morrison Robot," Matt will now take questions. But please, only about Futurella, not the Simpsons. Yes? The robot standing on the small child over there?"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Bender," Yeah, when are you going to make a second Simpsons Movie? [A panel slides open from underneath Groening's nameplate. A gun slides out and shoots Bender.] D'oh!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Fry," Mr. Aragonés, I'm a big fan of your cartoons and your mustache."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Aragonés, You want it? Take it. It's brought me nothing but misery.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Fry," Wow. Thanks! [He rips the mustache off Aragonés' face and puts it on. Aragonés screams  ¡Ay, ay, ay!] If you could just quiet down, I wanted to get your opinion of my comic book."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Aragonés," Señor, anyone who still writes comics is a hero to me. [He smiles. Fry shows him the comic and he stops smiling.] Mmm. It stinks. But, um, I do like the tiny doodles in the margins."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Fry," Oh, that's just some relish from a hot dog I found."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Man," Attention, ladies and gentleboys, the costume contest is about to begin."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Bender, [Running up to Fry.] The costume contest! The costume contest! [He runs off.]
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela, What the hell are you supposed to be?
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Bender," [In a crude Leela costume.] Every nerd's fantasy, baby."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Randy," [Dressed as Mario.] Next up, contestant number 36! [A fat man dressed as Spiderman drives up in a scooter. He shoots out whipped cream at the crowd then some into his mouth. He drives off.] Contestant 36, everyone. Next up, contestant 37..."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," [softly.] I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet..."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Randy," Hold on a second, let me just get this. [He adjusts the microphone.]"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8. You are hereby conquered! Please line up in order of how much beryllium it takes to kill you. [The crowd cheers.]"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Grrrl," [She takes off her Decapodian costume.] Damn, that's a good costume."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Randy, [As the Omicronians are being pushed off-stage.] Next up contestant 38!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, I don't understand. Why are the human still eating their soft pretzels instead of surrendering?
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela, [While eating a soft pretzel.] They're probably waiting for Joss Whedon.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr,"  Joss Whedon's here? Wait a minute, you look familiar."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela," Yeah, you almost ate me once. I was in your mouth for five minutes."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, Leela?
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Randy," And the winner is, Nerdgasma! [Bender walks up.]"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Bender," Wooh, I've got fruit boobs!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, What's the use?
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, Now what?
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd," I send you out to conquer a planet and all you bring back is J.J. Abrams' face? [A face is lying in a box, nearby.]"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, I thought you'd like it. You haven't even tried it on.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd, I might dress up in a face if you ever took me anywhere nice!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Oh, boy, here we go. I built this castle with my own two slaves. What are you gonna to do, kick me out?"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8. May I crash on your couch?"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Farnsworth," So he just showed up unannounced, raided the liquor cabinet, sprayed urine on the ceiling and passed out?"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Amy, And the walls.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, Leave me alone. My wife hates me and planetary conquest has become a chore.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Farnsworth," There, there. You're just having a mid-life crisis."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Mid-life crisis, eh? [He pulls out a ray-gun.] Lrrr demands the comfort of pop-psychological platitudes."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Bender," Look, hoss, your wife threw you out. That's your license to be a jerk. Do whatever the hell you want then walk away and light a cigar. [He pulls a cigar out of his chest cabinet, lights it, and walks away."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela," Don't listen to him, Lrrr. Bender may seem happy. [Bender can be heard laughing.] But in the long-tern, you need to reinvest in your relationship with Ndnd."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Yes, it's clear what I must do."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, I like it.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Surgeon, I'm thinking we downplay those hideous growths on your head. [A hologram shows Lrrr and it is changed to make him seem human with full hair.]
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Horns are a sign of virility. Also, they house my testes."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Surgeon, I'm thinking horn extension.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Bender," You'll need some arm candy. It's the perfect accessory for out-of-shape, middle-aged creeps like you. Yeah, I said it! What's your time, Borgnine?"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, Big and angry. [He unzips his jacket and pulls out a magazine. He unfolds several pages to reveal a picture of a naked Omicronian woman. Bender's eyes zoom in then suddenly wilt.]
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Bender," Look, brah, you just not gonna find a whole lot of hot, gigantic Omicronian babes in this solar system."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, There's one! [He stuffs his magazine into his jacket as the woman walks over.]
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Grrrl," Hey, cool cape. Were'd you get it?"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," What, this old thing? I murdered my father. My name's Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Grrrl, I am called Grrrl.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, Of the planet Omicron Persei 8? That is a pretty name.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," What's on the TV tonight? Oh, wait! I don't care, because I've got a date!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela," I know it's not what you want to hear, but I think this is a mistake."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Fry, Leela's right. That's not what you want to hear. What you want to hear is that I fixed my comic book. Now the hero is more reliable because he has no more ridiculous powers.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Let's watch, shall we."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Invader X, One more step and little Miss Constructive Criticism here gets it!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Delivery-Boy Man," Oh, yeah? I may be just a simple delivery boy with no superpowers, so there's nothing I can do."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Invader X, Okay. [He disintegrates Lane. Delivery-Boy Man bursts into tears.]
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Fry, So? Give me your honest praise.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela," Fry, I've now seen two comic books, so listen to me. Why should I care about the hero when all he does is cry?"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, Hmm. That dinner was a worthy foe.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Grrrl," Yes, we shall not see its like again. So, um... [She begins kissing Lrrr.]"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Um, I'm sorry. I haven't done this for a while. I just got partway out of a bad relationship."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Grrrl," Maybe I should take this off. [She begins taking off her dress and Lrrr's laser fires. Grrrl reaches back and unzips her costume, revealing her to be a human.]"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, [He screams.] You're a human?
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Grrrl," Only physically. I'm a cross-species dresser. [She hangs up the costume.] Wait, you're an actual Omicronian?"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Oh, God. Oh God, what have I done?"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Grrrl," This is so hot! Conquer me, Lrrr! Sharpen your horns on my scaly thorax! [She jumps him.]"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, [Sobbing.] I want to go home! But Ndnd would never take me back now.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela," Ndnd just wants what every she-beast wants, to feel like you're listening to her nagging. Is there anything she has been riding your ass about?"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Conquering things, I guess. I could conquer Earth, kill all humans."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Bender, There's a thought.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela, No! We don't need a war of the worlds.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Fry, That's it! We need a War of the Worlds! I'll call Orson Welles [He begins dialing his cell phone.]
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Bender, Dork calling Orson! Dork calling Orson!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Welles," You're asking me, the renowned spokesperson for Paul Masson wine, to recreate my brilliant  1938 radio broadcast merely to deceive and impress the wife of this skinny reptile?"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Fry, Sorry. Never mind.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Welles, I do it for free.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Welles," Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt our program of the Jonas Brothers and their orchestra to bring you a special bulletin. [Outside, the electromagnetic waves leave Planet Express and head to Omicron Persei 8.]"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,<poem>Welles, We interrupt our program of the Jonas Brothers and their orchestra to bring you a special bulletin.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Welles," [on TV.] I'm speaking to you from the hickory farms in Grover's Mall, New Jersey,  [on the TV, an image of the Planet Express building appears. It has a sign that says Grover's Mall and a poorly designed, fake flying saucer is being dangled in front of the camera. Amy and Hermes exit the building, carrying a picnic basket.] through a mouthful of summer sausage, mmm, where I hardly know where to being. Mmm! [The scene of TV changes the saucer being dangled over a city made of household items.] A huge spacecraft, piloted by a devastatingly handsome... Now, how, in God's name, do I know what the fellow looks like if he's inside a ship miles in the air? [The scene cuts back to Planet Express.] It's just foolish on its face."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Fry," If you want the cheese log, you'll read what I wrote."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Welles, Very well. I shall comply.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Welles," I'm getting reports that cities across the globe are being destroyed by this noble invader, whose good looks are apparently discernible across vast distances and through solid metal. [The ""spacecraft"" lands in front of the White House and Lrrr walks up.] But wait, the leader of the attack is swaggering out of his ship and up to a convenient nearby microphone. Now why couldn't I have just described his appearance at this point? This is the type of thing I'm talking about."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,<poem>Lrrr," People of Earth, I am Lrrr, conqueror of your planet. [He whispers to the Planet Express crew.] Cue screams. [They scream.] You will now remove your skulls and play dodgeball with them for my amusement."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd, Ooh! I could swear his horns have gotten longer!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Kif," Sir, I've intercepted an Earth broadcast."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Zapp," Put it up on the Zenith. [The fake broadcast is shown.] Oh, God!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,<poem>Welles," [on TV.] Earth is conquered, the destruction of civilization complete. Now stay tuned for Little Orphan Annie."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Zapp, To hell with Little Orphan Annie! We've got to do something.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," What's that, honey? How many dead? Uh, I don't know, 80 million? Okay. I love you, too. [He hangs up.] That was Ndnd, she's taking me back! [The crew cheers. Hermes is holding Welles.]"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Welles, I'm sorry I've been so difficult.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Zapp," So, you thought you could conquer us so easily, eh? Nice job. We surrender. Earth is yours. [Lrrr chuckles nervously.]"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Welles," Damn, I'm good. Now, may I please have that cheese log?"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Zapp," Oh, glorious conqueror, permit me to offer up a sacrifice. [He holds up Kif.] How 'bout this?"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Kif, [Lrrr eats one of his legs.] Hey!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Yeah, he'll do."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,<poem>Leela," Come on, Lrrr. Show's over."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Fine, okay. About this conquering thing. [He chuckles.] Funny story."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd," Hello, Lrrr."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela, Lrrr! Put a stop to this right now!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Okay, okay. Quit nagging!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd," Lrrr, why are you yelling softly with the purple-furred one?"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Uh, it's nothing, my queen. [He tosses Leela away and kisses Ndnd's hand.]"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela, He messed up my hair.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Kif, I'm missing a leg.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Zapp," We fought like Hell, sir, but in the end, we caved like a house of soufflé cards."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Nixon," Got it. Peace with honor. Well, I resign again."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd," Come, Nixon. Introduce me to the kitchen staff. I must lay down the law about Lrrr's low sodium diet. [She, Zapp and Nixon leave. Lrrr starts eating peanuts.]"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela, You've got to tell her the truth. And lay off the salted peanuts!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, I'm just trying to get the leg taste out of my mouth.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd," Lrrr, I'm in here now, not out there!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Give me a little time. With a lady like Ndnd, one must use finesse. [He walks away.] Coming, giangantums!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd, [She eats a gem.] Mmm. That's crisp.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Yes, but no more so than your squamous dorsal plates in the moonlight."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd, [She shudders.] I am experiencing arousal. My organs are moving into position. [They kiss. Lrrr sees Leela looking at him and stops.]
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Ndnd, there's something that I've got to tell you."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd, What is it? Is there someone else?
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,<poem>Lrrr," What? No, no, it's about this takeover of Earth. It's... It's..."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd, The spark that reignited our marriage?
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, Yes! Exactly. Good night. [He rolls over and pretends to be asleep.]
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela," Oh, lord! Now what?"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, I couldn't tell her the truth!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,<poem>Leela," Look, you scaly crybaby, you'll do what I say and do it now!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd, I knew it!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Bender, [He pulls two frying pans out of his cabinet.] Frying pans! Cast-iron frying pans!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, It's not what it looks like! What do I do?
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela, Do what I say. Tell her!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd, Tell me what? [To Bender.] Give me the heavy one. [She hands him some money.]
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, The invasion was all a fake. I just wanted to impress you.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd, You lied? What else have you been hiding from me?
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, What else? Nothing else.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Grrrl," I still want you, Lrrr, and I'm willing to fight for you."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Bender, All I've got left is a colander and a pie pan.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd, Lrrr?
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Look, we only had one date. I barely mated with her."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd, Whatever. I harbor no resentment against her. [She takes Grrrl's gun and shoots her with it.] What I want to know is what is up between you and Bossy Boots here.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr, Her? She's just a bossy friend.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd," Exactly! She nagged you, tormented you, and pushed you around. That is my job! This must be settled. I demand the ancient ritual of Rrrmrrrmrrrfrrrmrrr or Consequences!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Fry, Rrrmrrrmrrrfrrrmrrr or what?
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd, Let the ritual begin. The rules are the same as in the home version. Lrrr must simply choose between myself and Leela...
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela, Fine. Hurry up.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd, By shooting the one he rejects.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela," Lrrr, I'm getting angry. Don't you go through with this."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd, She is not the boss of you! I am the boss of you! [She throws Lrrr the gun.]
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Fry, Leela's gonna die. What would Delivery-Boy Man do? [He looks at the comic. The superhero is crying.]
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,<poem>Lrrr, [He is sweating and moving the gun between the two women.] I do not want to shoot anybody.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd, You never want to do anything!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Oh, nag, nag, nag."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd, You want me to stop nagging? Then shoot me!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lrrr," Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd, Beats staring at your fat ass on the couch.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd," Oh, yeah! Well I'll show you. [He aims at Leela.]"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Fry, [He jumps in front of Leela.] Ray-blocking power! [He is disintegrated.]
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela, Fry! [She starts crying.]
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Ndnd," Lrrr, you were willing to shoot that bossy temptress! You really do value my nagging above all others!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela," Good night, dumb prince."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Grrrl," [She runs up.] Come back, Lrrr! I wanna have your Popplers! They'll never be anyone but you! [She looks at Zoidberg.] Hello."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Zoidberg, Of course I'll marry you!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Amy," Wait, what the Shmell happened? I thought Ndnd disintegrated you with this ray gun."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Grrrl, It's just a cheap teleporter. I bought it off the back of a comic book.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Farnsworth, Cha-ching!
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela, The teleporter gun? But that means Fry might still be...
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,[Scene, Planet Express.]
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,<poem>Amy, Fry?
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Zoidberg, Fry?
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Bender, [He opens the shower. Fry is sitting there.] Is this him?
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela," Fry, you're alive!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Fry," Not only that, I now know exactly how to end my comic book. Let's watch."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Invader X," Say good-bye to your forehead, 'cause I'm gonna shoot you in it!"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Delivery-Boy Man," Not if I leap in front of your death ray, and I am gonna do that. Jumping sound! Ow! [He is on the floor.]"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Invader X," I didn't shoot yet. As usual, your delivery arrived too soon. [He is crushed by a freak meteor.]"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Lane," Oh, Delivery-Boy Man! You saved me by random chance."
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Delivery-Boy Man," Don't thank random chance. Thank my meteor-wishing power, with your lips. [They kiss.]"
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,Leela, [She kisses Fry on the cheek.] Good ending. Not great.
Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences,,
